 the rape of lucrece
 the argument
lucius tarquinius for his excessive pride surnamed superbus
after he had caused his own fatherinlaw servius tullius to be
cruelly murdered and contrary to the roman laws and customs
not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages had
possessed himself of the kingdom went accompanied with his sons
and other noblemen of rome to besiege ardea during which siege
the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of
sextus tarquinius the king's son in their discourses after
supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife among
whom collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife
lucretia in that pleasant humour they posted to rome and
intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of
that which every one had before avouched only collatinus finds
his wife though it were late in the night spinning amongst her
maids the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or
in several disports whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus
the victory and his wife the fame at that time sextus
tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece beauty yet smothering
his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the
camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and
was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by
lucrece at collatium the same night he treacherously stealeth
into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the
morning speedeth away lucrece in this lamentable plight
hastily dispatcheth messengers one to rome for her father
another to the camp for collatine they came the one
accompanied with junius brutus the other with publius valerius
and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause
of her sorrow she first taking an oath of them for her
revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and
withal suddenly stabbed herself which done with one consent
they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
tarquins and bearing the dead body to rome brutus acquainted
the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a
bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the
people were so moved that with one consent and a general
acclamation the tarquins were all exiled and the state
government changed from kings to consuls
 the rape of lucrece
from the besieged ardea all in post
borne by the trustless wings of false desire
lustbreathed tarquin leaves the roman host
and to collatium bears the lightless fire
which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire
and girdle with embracing flames the waist
of collatine's fair love lucrece the chaste
haply that name of chaste unhappily set
this bateless edge on his keen appetite
when collatine unwisely did not let
to praise the clear unmatched red and white
which triumph'd in that sky of his delight
where mortal stars as bright as heaven's beauties
with pure aspects did him peculiar duties
for he the night before in tarquin's tent
unlock'd the treasure of his happy state
what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
in the possession of his beauteous mate
reckoning his fortune at such highproud rate
that kings might be espoused to more fame
but king nor peer to such a peerless dame
o happiness enjoy'd but of a few
and if possess'd as soon decay'd and done
as is the morning's silvermelting dew
against the golden splendor of the sun
an expired date cancell'd ere well begun
honour and beauty in the owner's arms
are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms
beauty itself doth of itself persuade
the eyes of men without an orator
what needeth then apologies be made
to set forth that which is so singular
or why is collatine the publisher
of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
from thievish ears because it is his own
perchance his boast of lucrece sovereignty
suggested this proud issue of a king
for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be
perchance that envy of so rich a thing
braving compare disdainfully did sting
his highpitch'd thoughts that meaner men should vaunt
that golden hap which their superiors want
but some untimely thought did instigate
his alltootimeless speed if none of those
his honour his affairs his friends his state
neglected all with swift intent he goes
to quench the coal which in his liver glows
o rash false heat wrapp'd in repentant cold
thy hasty spring still blasts and ne'er grows old
when at collatium this false lord arrived
well was he welcomed by the roman dame
within whose face beauty and virtue strived
which of them both should underprop her fame
when virtue bragg'd beauty would blush for shame
when beauty boasted blushes in despite
virtue would stain that o'er with silver white
but beauty in that white intituled
from venus doves doth challenge that fair field
then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red
which virtue gave the golden age to gild
their silver cheeks and call'd it then their shield
teaching them thus to use it in the fight
when shame assail'd the red should fence the white
this heraldry in lucrece face was seen
argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
of either's colour was the other queen
proving from world's minority their right
yet their ambition makes them still to fight
the sovereignty of either being so great
that oft they interchange each other's seat
their silent war of lilies and of roses
which tarquin view'd in her fair face's field
in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses
where lest between them both it should be kill'd
the coward captive vanquished doth yield
to those two armies that would let him go
rather than triumph in so false a foe
now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue
the niggard prodigal that praised her so
in that high task hath done her beauty wrong
which far exceeds his barren skill to show
therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
enchanted tarquin answers with surmise
in silent wonder of stillgazing eyes
this earthly saint adored by this devil
little suspecteth the false worshipper
for unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil
birds never limed no secret bushes fear
so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
and reverend welcome to her princely guest
whose inward ill no outward harm express'd
for that he colour'd with his high estate
hiding base sin in plaits of majesty
that nothing in him seem'd inordinate
save something too much wonder of his eye
which having all all could not satisfy
but poorly rich so wanteth in his store
that cloy'd with much he pineth still for more
but she that never coped with stranger eyes
could pick no meaning from their parling looks
nor read the subtleshining secrecies
writ in the glassy margents of such books
she touch'd no unknown baits nor fear'd no hooks
nor could she moralize his wanton sight
more than his eyes were open'd to the light
he stories to her ears her husband's fame
won in the fields of fruitful italy
and decks with praises collatine's high name
made glorious by his manly chivalry
with bruised arms and wreaths of victory
her joy with heavedup hand she doth express
and wordless so greets heaven for his success
far from the purpose of his coming hither
he makes excuses for his being there
no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
till sable night mother of dread and fear
upon the world dim darkness doth display
and in her vaulty prison stows the day
for then is tarquin brought unto his bed
intending weariness with heavy spright
for after supper long he questioned
with modest lucrece and wore out the night
now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight
and every one to rest themselves betake
save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake
as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
the sundry dangers of his will's obtaining
yet ever to obtain his will resolving
though weakbuilt hopes persuade him to abstaining
despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining
and when great treasure is the meed proposed
though death be adjunct there's no death supposed
those that much covet are with gain so fond
for what they have not that which they possess
they scatter and unloose it from their bond
and so by hoping more they have but less
or gaining more the profit of excess
is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain
that they prove bankrupt in this poorrich gain
the aim of all is but to nurse the life
with honour wealth and ease in waning age
and in this aim there is such thwarting strife
that one for all or all for one we gage
as life for honour in fell battle's rage
honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
the death of all and all together lost
so that in venturing ill we leave to be
the things we are for that which we expect
and this ambitious foul infirmity
in having much torments us with defect
of that we have so then we do neglect
the thing we have and all for want of wit
make something nothing by augmenting it
such hazard now must doting tarquin make
pawning his honour to obtain his lust
and for himself himself be must forsake
then where is truth if there be no selftrust
when shall he think to find a stranger just
when he himself himself confounds betrays
to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days
now stole upon the time the dead of night
when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
no comfortable star did lend his light
no noise but owls and wolves deathboding cries
now serves the season that they may surprise
the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still
while lust and murder wake to stain and kill
and now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed
throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm
is madly toss'd between desire and dread
th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm
but honest fear bewitch'd with lust's foul charm
doth too too oft betake him to retire
beaten away by brainsick rude desire
his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth
that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly
whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth
which must be lodestar to his lustful eye
and to the flame thus speaks advisedly
'as from this cold flint i enforced this fire
so lucrece must i force to my desire'
here pale with fear he doth premeditate
the dangers of his loathsome enterprise
and in his inward mind he doth debate
what following sorrow may on this arise
then looking scornfully he doth despise
his naked armour of stillslaughter'd lust
and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust
'fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not
to darken her whose light excelleth thine
and die unhallow'd thoughts before you blot
with your uncleanness that which is divine
offer pure incense to so pure a shrine
let fair humanity abhor the deed
that spots and stains love's modest snowwhite weed
'o shame to knighthood and to shining arms
o foul dishonour to my household's grave
o impious act including all foul harms
a martial man to be soft fancy's slave
true valour still a true respect should have
then my digression is so vile so base
that it will live engraven in my face
'yea though i die the scandal will survive
and be an eyesore in my golden coat
some loathsome dash the herald will contrive
to cipher me how fondly i did dote
that my posterity shamed with the note
shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin
to wish that i their father had not bin
'what win i if i gain the thing i seek
a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy
who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week
or sells eternity to get a toy
for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy
or what fond beggar but to touch the crown
would with the sceptre straight be strucken down
'if collatinus dream of my intent
will he not wake and in a desperate rage
post hither this vile purpose to prevent
this siege that hath engirt his marriage
this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage
this dying virtue this surviving shame
whose crime will bear an everduring blame
'o what excuse can my invention make
when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake
mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed
the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed
and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
but cowardlike with trembling terror die
'had collatinus kill'd my son or sire
or lain in ambush to betray my life
or were he not my dear friend this desire
might have excuse to work upon his wife
as in revenge or quittal of such strife
but as he is my kinsman my dear friend
the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end
'shameful it is ay if the fact be known
hateful it is there is no hate in loving
i'll beg her love but she is own
the worst is but denial and reproving
my will is strong past reason's weak removing
who fears a sentence or an old man's saw
shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe'
thus graceless holds he disputation
'tween frozen conscience and hotburning will
and with good thoughts make dispensation
urging the worser sense for vantage still
which in a moment doth confound and kill
all pure effects and doth so far proceed
that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed
quoth he she took me kindly by the hand
and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes
fearing some hard news from the warlike band
where her beloved collatinus lies
o how her fear did make her colour rise
first red as roses that on lawn we lay
then white as lawn the roses took away
'and how her hand in my hand being lock'd
forced it to tremble with her loyal fear
which struck her sad and then it faster rock'd
until her husband's welfare she did hear
whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
that had narcissus seen her as she stood
selflove had never drown'd him in the flood
'why hunt i then for colour or excuses
all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth
poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses
love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth
affection is my captain and he leadeth
and when his gaudy banner is display'd
the coward fights and will not be dismay'd
'then childish fear avaunt debating die
respect and reason wait on wrinkled age
my heart shall never countermand mine eye
sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage
my part is youth and beats these from the stage
desire my pilot is beauty my prize
then who fears sinking where such treasure lies'
as corn o'ergrown by weeds so heedful fear
is almost choked by unresisted lust
away he steals with open listening ear
full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust
both which as servitors to the unjust
so cross him with their opposite persuasion
that now he vows a league and now invasion
within his thought her heavenly image sits
and in the selfsame seat sits collatine
that eye which looks on her confounds his wits
that eye which him beholds as more divine
unto a view so false will not incline
but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart
which once corrupted takes the worser part
and therein heartens up his servile powers
who flatter'd by their leader's jocund show
stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours
and as their captain so their pride doth grow
paying more slavish tribute than they owe
by reprobate desire thus madly led
the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed
the locks between her chamber and his will
each one by him enforced retires his ward
but as they open they all rate his ill
which drives the creeping thief to some regard
the threshold grates the door to have him heard
nightwandering weasels shriek to see him there
they fright him yet he still pursues his fear
as each unwilling portal yields him way
through little vents and crannies of the place
the wind wars with his torch to make him stay
and blows the smoke of it into his face
extinguishing his conduct in this case
but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch
puffs forth another wind that fires the torch
and being lighted by the light he spies
lucretia's glove wherein her needle sticks
he takes it from the rushes where it lies
and griping it the needle his finger pricks
as who should say this glove to wanton tricks
is not inured return again in haste
thou see'st our mistress ornaments are chaste'
but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him
he in the worst sense construes their denial
the doors the wind the glove that did delay him
he takes for accidental things of trial
or as those bars which stop the hourly dial
who with a lingering slay his course doth let
till every minute pays the hour his debt
'so so quoth he these lets attend the time
like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
to add a more rejoicing to the prime
and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
pain pays the income of each precious thing
huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands
the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands'
now is he come unto the chamberdoor
that shuts him from the heaven of his thought
which with a yielding latch and with no more
hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought
so from himself impiety hath wrought
that for his prey to pray he doth begin
as if the heavens should countenance his sin
but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer
having solicited th eternal power
that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
and they would stand auspicious to the hour
even there he starts quoth he i must deflower
the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact
how can they then assist me in the act
'then love and fortune be my gods my guide
my will is back'd with resolution
thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried
the blackest sin is clear'd with absolution
against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution
the eye of heaven is out and misty night
covers the shame that follows sweet delight'
this said his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch
and with his knee the door he opens wide
the dove sleeps fast that this nightowl will catch
thus treason works ere traitors be espied
who sees the lurking serpent steps aside
but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing
lies at the mercy of his mortal sting
into the chamber wickedly he stalks
and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
the curtains being close about he walks
rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head
by their high treason is his heart misled
which gives the watchword to his hand full soon
to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon
look as the fair and fierypointed sun
rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight
even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun
to wink being blinded with a greater light
whether it is that she reflects so bright
that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed
but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed
o had they in that darksome prison died
then had they seen the period of their ill
then collatine again by lucrece side
in his clear bed might have reposed still
but they must ope this blessed league to kill
and holythoughted lucrece to their sight
must sell her joy her life her world's delight
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss
who therefore angry seems to part in sunder
swelling on either side to want his bliss
between whose hills her head entombed is
where like a virtuous monument she lies
to be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes
without the bed her other fair hand was
on the green coverlet whose perfect white
show'd like an april daisy on the grass
with pearly sweat resembling dew of night
her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light
and canopied in darkness sweetly lay
till they might open to adorn the day
her hair like golden threads play'd with her breath
o modest wantons wanton modesty
showing life's triumph in the map of death
and death's dim look in life's mortality
each in her sleep themselves so beautify
as if between them twain there were no strife
but that life lived in death and death in life
her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue
a pair of maiden worlds unconquered
save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew
and him by oath they truly honoured
these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred
who like a foul ursurper went about
from this fair throne to heave the owner out
what could he see but mightily he noted
what did he note but strongly he desired
what he beheld on that he firmly doted
and in his will his wilful eye he tired
with more than admiration he admired
her azure veins her alabaster skin
her coral lips her snowwhite dimpled chin
as the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey
sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied
so o'er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay
his rage of lust by gazing qualified
slack'd not suppress'd for standing by her side
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
unto a greater uproar tempts his veins
and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting
obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting
in bloody death and ravishment delighting
nor children's tears nor mothers groans respecting
swell in their pride the onset still expecting
anon his beating heart alarum striking
gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking
his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
his eye commends the leading to his hand
his hand as proud of such a dignity
smoking with pride march'd on to make his stand
on her bare breast the heart of all her land
whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale
left there round turrets destitute and pale
they mustering to the quiet cabinet
where their dear governess and lady lies
do tell her she is dreadfully beset
and fright her with confusion of their cries
she much amazed breaks ope her lock'dup eyes
who peeping forth this tumult to behold
are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd
imagine her as one in dead of night
from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
whose grim aspect sets every joint ashaking
what terror or tis but she in worser taking
from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
the sight which makes supposed terror true
wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears
like to a newkill'd bird she trembling lies
she dares not look yet winking there appears
quickshifting antics ugly in her eyes
such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries
who angry that the eyes fly from their lights
in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights
his hand that yet remains upon her breast
rude ram to batter such an ivory wall
may feel her heartpoor citizendistress'd
wounding itself to death rise up and fall
beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal
this moves in him more rage and lesser pity
to make the breach and enter this sweet city
first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
to sound a parley to his heartless foe
who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin
the reason of this rash alarm to know
which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show
but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
under what colour he commits this ill
thus he replies the colour in thy face
that even for anger makes the lily pale
and the red rose blush at her own disgrace
shall plead for me and tell my loving tale
under that colour am i come to scale
thy neverconquer'd fort the fault is thine
for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine
'thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide
thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night
where thou with patience must my will abide
my will that marks thee for my earth's delight
which i to conquer sought with all my might
but as reproof and reason beat it dead
by thy bright beauty was it newly bred
'i see what crosses my attempt will bring
i know what thorns the growing rose defends
i think the honey guarded with a sting
all this beforehand counsel comprehends
but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends
only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
and dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty
'i have debated even in my soul
what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed
but nothing can affection's course control
or stop the headlong fury of his speed
i know repentant tears ensue the deed
reproach disdain and deadly enmity
yet strive i to embrace mine infamy'
this said he shakes aloft his roman blade
which like a falcon towering in the skies
coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade
whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
so under his insulting falchion lies
harmless lucretia marking what he tells
with trembling fear as fowl hear falcon's bells
'lucrece quoth he'this night i must enjoy thee
if thou deny then force must work my way
for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee
that done some worthless slave of thine i'll slay
to kill thine honour with thy life's decay
and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him
swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him
'so thy surviving husband shall remain
the scornful mark of every open eye
thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain
thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy
and thou the author of their obloquy
shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
and sung by children in succeeding times
'but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend
the fault unknown is as a thought unacted
a little harm done to a great good end
for lawful policy remains enacted
the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
in a pure compound being so applied
his venom in effect is purified
'then for thy husband and thy children's sake
tender my suit bequeath not to their lot
the shame that from them no device can take
the blemish that will never be forgot
worse than a slavish wipe or birthhour's blot
for marks descried in men's nativity
are nature's faults not their own infamy'
here with a cockatrice deadkilling eye
he rouseth up himself and makes a pause
while she the picture of pure piety
like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws
pleads in a wilderness where are no laws
to the rough beast that knows no gentle right
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
but when a blackfaced cloud the world doth threat
in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding
from earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get
which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding
hindering their present fall by this dividing
so his unhallow'd haste her words delays
and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays
yet foul nightwaking cat he doth but dally
while in his holdfast foot the weak mouse panteth
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth
his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
no penetrable entrance to her plaining
tears harden lust though marble wear with raining
her pitypleading eyes are sadly fix'd
in the remorseless wrinkles of his face
her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd
which to her oratory adds more grace
she puts the period often from his place
and midst the sentence so her accent breaks
that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks
she conjures him by high almighty jove
by knighthood gentry and sweet friendship's oath
by her untimely tears her husband's love
by holy human law and common troth
by heaven and earth and all the power of both
that to his borrow'd bed he make retire
and stoop to honour not to foul desire
quoth she reward not hospitality
with such black payment as thou hast pretended
mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee
mar not the thing that cannot be amended
end thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended
he is no woodman that doth bend his bow
to strike a poor unseasonable doe
'my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me
thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me
myself a weakling do not then ensnare me
thou look'st not like deceit do not deceive me
my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee
if ever man were moved with woman moans
be moved with my tears my sighs my groans
'all which together like a troubled ocean
beat at thy rocky and wreckthreatening heart
to soften it with their continual motion
for stones dissolved to water do convert
o if no harder than a stone thou art
melt at my tears and be compassionate
soft pity enters at an iron gate
'in tarquin's likeness i did entertain thee
hast thou put on his shape to do him shame
to all the host of heaven i complain me
thou wrong'st his honour wound'st his princely name
thou art not what thou seem'st and if the same
thou seem'st not what thou art a god a king
for kings like gods should govern everything
'how will thy shame be seeded in thine age
when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
if in thy hope thou darest do such outrage
what darest thou not when once thou art a king
o be remember'd no outrageous thing
from vassal actors can be wiped away
then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay
'this deed will make thee only loved for fear
but happy monarchs still are fear'd for love
with foul offenders thou perforce must bear
when they in thee the like offences prove
if but for fear of this thy will remove
for princes are the glass the school the book
where subjects eyes do learn do read do look
'and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn
must he in thee read lectures of such shame
wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
authority for sin warrant for blame
to privilege dishonour in thy name
thou black'st reproach against longliving laud
and makest fair reputation but a bawd
'hast thou command by him that gave it thee
from a pure heart command thy rebel will
draw not thy sword to guard iniquity
for it was lent thee all that brood to kill
thy princely office how canst thou fulfil
when pattern'd by thy fault foul sin may say
he learn'd to sin and thou didst teach the way
'think but how vile a spectacle it were
to view thy present trespass in another
men's faults do seldom to themselves appear
their own transgressions partially they smother
this guilt would seem deathworthy in thy brother
o how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
that from their own misdeeds askance their eyes
'to thee to thee my heavedup hands appeal
not to seducing lust thy rash relier
i sue for exiled majesty's repeal
let him return and flattering thoughts retire
his true respect will prison false desire
and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne
that thou shalt see thy state and pity mine'
'have done quoth he my uncontrolled tide
turns not but swells the higher by this let
small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide
and with the wind in greater fury fret
the petty streams that pay a daily debt
to their salt sovereign with their fresh falls haste
add to his flow but alter not his taste'
'thou art quoth she a sea a sovereign king
and lo there falls into thy boundless flood
black lust dishonour shame misgoverning
who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed
and not the puddle in thy sea dispersed
'so shall these slaves be king and thou their slave
thou nobly base they basely dignified
thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave
thou loathed in their shame they in thy pride
the lesser thing should not the greater hide
the cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot
but low shrubs wither at the cedar's root
'so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state'
no more quoth he by heaven i will not hear thee
yield to my love if not enforced hate
instead of love's coy touch shall rudely tear thee
that done despitefully i mean to bear thee
unto the base bed of some rascal groom
to be thy partner in this shameful doom'
this said he sets his foot upon the light
for light and lust are deadly enemies
shame folded up in blind concealing night
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
the wolf hath seized his prey the poor lamb cries
till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
entombs her outcry in her lips sweet fold
for with the nightly linen that she wears
he pens her piteous clamours in her head
cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed
the spots whereof could weeping purify
her tears should drop on them perpetually
but she hath lost a dearer thing than life
and he hath won what he would lose again
this forced league doth force a further strife
this momentary joy breeds months of pain
this hot desire converts to cold disdain
pure chastity is rifled of her store
and lust the thief far poorer than before
look as the fullfed hound or gorged hawk
unapt for tender smell or speedy flight
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
the prey wherein by nature they delight
so surfeittaking tarquin fares this night
his taste delicious in digestion souring
devours his will that lived by foul devouring
o deeper sin than bottomless conceit
can comprehend in still imagination
drunken desire must vomit his receipt
ere he can see his own abomination
while lust is in his pride no exclamation
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
till like a jade selfwill himself doth tire
and then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek
with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace
feeble desire all recreant poor and meek
like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case
the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace
for there it revels and when that decays
the guilty rebel for remission prays
so fares it with this faultful lord of rome
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
for now against himself he sounds this doom
that through the length of times he stands disgraced
besides his soul's fair temple is defaced
to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
to ask the spotted princess how she fares
she says her subjects with foul insurrection
have batter'd down her consecrated wall
and by their mortal fault brought in subjection
her immortality and made her thrall
to living death and pain perpetual
which in her prescience she controlled still
but her foresight could not forestall their will
even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth
a captive victor that hath lost in gain
bearing away the wound that nothing healeth
the scar that will despite of cure remain
leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain
she bears the load of lust he left behind
and he the burden of a guilty mind
he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she like a wearied lamb lies panting there
he scowls and hates himself for his offence
she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear
he faintly flies sneaking with guilty fear
she stays exclaiming on the direful night
he runs and chides his vanish'd loathed delight
he thence departs a heavy convertite
she there remains a hopeless castaway
he in his speed looks for the morning light
she prays she never may behold the day
'for day quoth she nights scapes doth open lay
and my true eyes have never practised how
to cloak offences with a cunning brow
'they think not but that every eye can see
the same disgrace which they themselves behold
and therefore would they still in darkness be
to have their unseen sin remain untold
for they their guilt with weeping will unfold
and grave like water that doth eat in steel
upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel'
here she exclaims against repose and rest
and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind
she wakes her heart by beating on her breast
and bids it leap from thence where it may find
some purer chest to close so pure a mind
frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
against the unseen secrecy of night
'o comfortkilling night image of hell
dim register and notary of shame
black stage for tragedies and murders fell
vast sinconcealing chaos nurse of blame
blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame
grim cave of death whispering conspirator
with closetongued treason and the ravisher
'o hateful vaporous and foggy night
since thou art guilty of my cureless crime
muster thy mists to meet the eastern light
make war against proportion'd course of time
or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
his wonted height yet ere he go to bed
knit poisonous clouds about his golden head
'with rotten damps ravish the morning air
let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
the life of purity the supreme fair
ere he arrive his weary noontide prick
and let thy misty vapours march so thick
that in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
may set at noon and make perpetual night
'were tarquin night as he is but night's child
the silvershining queen he would distain
her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled
through night's black bosom should not peep again
so should i have copartners in my pain
and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage
as palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage
'where now i have no one to blush with me
to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine
to mask their brows and hide their infamy
but i alone alone must sit and pine
seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine
mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans
poor wasting monuments of lasting moans
'o night thou furnace of foulreeking smoke
let not the jealous day behold that face
which underneath thy black allhiding cloak
immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace
keep still possession of thy gloomy place
that all the faults which in thy reign are made
may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade
'make me not object to the telltale day
the light will show character'd in my brow
the story of sweet chastity's decay
the impious breach of holy wedlock vow
yea the illiterate that know not how
to cipher what is writ in learned books
will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks
'the nurse to still her child will tell my story
and fright her crying babe with tarquin's name
the orator to deck his oratory
will couple my reproach to tarquin's shame
feastfinding minstrels tuning my defame
will tie the hearers to attend each line
how tarquin wronged me i collatine
'let my good name that senseless reputation
for collatine's dear love be kept unspotted
if that be made a theme for disputation
the branches of another root are rotted
and undeserved reproach to him allotted
that is as clear from this attaint of mine
as i ere this was pure to collatine
'o unseen shame invisible disgrace
o unfelt sore crestwounding private scar
reproach is stamp'd in collatinus face
and tarquin's eye may read the mot afar
how he in peace is wounded not in war
alas how many bear such shameful blows
which not themselves but he that gives them knows
'if collatine thine honour lay in me
from me by strong assault it is bereft
my honour lost and i a dronelike bee
have no perfection of my summer left
but robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft
in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept
and suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept
'yet am i guilty of thy honour's wrack
yet for thy honour did i entertain him
coming from thee i could not put him back
for it had been dishonour to disdain him
besides of weariness he did complain him
and talk'd of virtue o unlook'dfor evil
when virtue is profaned in such a devil
'why should the worm intrude the maiden bud
or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests
or toads infect fair founts with venom mud
or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
or kings be breakers of their own behests
but no perfection is so absolute
that some impurity doth not pollute
'the aged man that coffersup his gold
is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits
and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold
but like stillpining tantalus he sits
and useless barns the harvest of his wits
having no other pleasure of his gain
but torment that it cannot cure his pain
'so then he hath it when he cannot use it
and leaves it to be master'd by his young
who in their pride do presently abuse it
their father was too weak and they too strong
to hold their cursedblessed fortune long
the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
even in the moment that we call them ours
'unruly blasts wait on the tender spring
unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers
the adder hisses where the sweet birds sing
what virtue breeds iniquity devours
we have no good that we can say is ours
but illannexed opportunity
or kills his life or else his quality
'o opportunity thy guilt is great
'tis thou that executest the traitor's treason
thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get
whoever plots the sin thou point'st the season
'tis thou that spurn'st at right at law at reason
and in thy shady cell where none may spy him
sits sin to seize the souls that wander by him
'thou makest the vestal violate her oath
thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd
thou smother'st honesty thou murder'st troth
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
thou plantest scandal and displacest laud
thou ravisher thou traitor thou false thief
thy honey turns to gall thy joy to grief
'thy secret pleasure turns to open shame
thy private feasting to a public fast
thy smoothing titles to a ragged name
thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste
thy violent vanities can never last
how comes it then vile opportunity
being so bad such numbers seek for thee
'when wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend
and bring him where his suit may be obtain'd
when wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end
or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd
give physic to the sick ease to the pain'd
the poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee
but they ne'er meet with opportunity
'the patient dies while the physician sleeps
the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds
justice is feasting while the widow weeps
advice is sporting while infection breeds
thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds
wrath envy treason rape and murder's rages
thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages
'when truth and virtue have to do with thee
a thousand crosses keep them from thy aid
they buy thy help but sin ne'er gives a fee
he gratis comes and thou art well appaid
as well to hear as grant what he hath said
my collatine would else have come to me
when tarquin did but he was stay'd by thee
guilty thou art of murder and of theft
guilty of perjury and subornation
guilty of treason forgery and shift
guilty of incest that abomination
an accessary by thine inclination
to all sins past and all that are to come
from the creation to the general doom
'misshapen time copesmate of ugly night
swift subtle post carrier of grisly care
eater of youth false slave to false delight
base watch of woes sin's packhorse virtue's snare
thou nursest all and murder'st all that are
o hear me then injurious shifting time
be guilty of my death since of my crime
'why hath thy servant opportunity
betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose
cancell'd my fortunes and enchained me
to endless date of neverending woes
time's office is to fine the hate of foes
to eat up errors by opinion bred
not spend the dowry of a lawful bed
'time's glory is to calm contending kings
to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light
to stamp the seal of time in aged things
to wake the morn and sentinel the night
to wrong the wronger till he render right
to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
and smear with dust their glittering golden towers
'to fill with wormholes stately monuments
to feed oblivion with decay of things
to blot old books and alter their contents
to pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings
to dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs
to spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel
and turn the giddy round of fortune's wheel
'to show the beldam daughters of her daughter
to make the child a man the man a child
to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter
to tame the unicorn and lion wild
to mock the subtle in themselves beguiled
to cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops
and waste huge stones with little water drops
'why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage
unless thou couldst return to make amends
one poor retiring minute in an age
would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends
lending him wit that to bad debtors lends
o this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back
i could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack
'thou ceaseless lackey to eternity
with some mischance cross tarquin in his flight
devise extremes beyond extremity
to make him curse this cursed crimeful night
let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright
and the dire thought of his committed evil
shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil
'disturb his hours of rest with restless trances
afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
to make him moan but pity not his moans
stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones
and let mild women to him lose their mildness
wilder to him than tigers in their wildness
'let him have time to tear his curled hair
let him have time against himself to rave
let him have time of time's help to despair
let him have time to live a loathed slave
let him have time a beggar's orts to crave
and time to see one that by alms doth live
disdain to him disdained scraps to give
'let him have time to see his friends his foes
and merry fools to mock at him resort
let him have time to mark how slow time goes
in time of sorrow and how swift and short
his time of folly and his time of sport
and ever let his unrecalling crime
have time to wail th abusing of his time
'o time thou tutor both to good and bad
teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill
at his own shadow let the thief run mad
himself himself seek every hour to kill
such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill
for who so base would such an office have
as slanderous death'sman to so base a slave
'the baser is he coming from a king
to shame his hope with deeds degenerate
the mightier man the mightier is the thing
that makes him honour'd or begets him hate
for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
the moon being clouded presently is miss'd
but little stars may hide them when they list
'the crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire
and unperceived fly with the filth away
but if the like the snowwhite swan desire
the stain upon his silver down will stay
poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day
gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly
but eagles gazed upon with every eye
'out idle words servants to shallow fools
unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators
busy yourselves in skillcontending schools
debate where leisure serves with dull debaters
to trembling clients be you mediators
for me i force not argument a straw
since that my case is past the help of law
'in vain i rail at opportunity
at time at tarquin and uncheerful night
in vain i cavil with mine infamy
in vain i spurn at my confirm'd despite
this helpless smoke of words doth me no right
the remedy indeed to do me good
is to let forth my fouldefiled blood
'poor hand why quiver'st thou at this decree
honour thyself to rid me of this shame
for if i die my honour lives in thee
but if i live thou livest in my defame
since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame
and wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe
kill both thyself and her for yielding so'
this said from her betumbled couch she starteth
to find some desperate instrument of death
but this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
to make more vent for passage of her breath
which thronging through her lips so vanisheth
as smoke from aetna that in air consumes
or that which from discharged cannon fumes
'in vain quoth she i live and seek in vain
some happy mean to end a hapless life
i fear'd by tarquin's falchion to be slain
yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife
but when i fear'd i was a loyal wife
so am i now o no that cannot be
of that true type hath tarquin rifled me
'o that is gone for which i sought to live
and therefore now i need not fear to die
to clear this spot by death at least i give
a badge of fame to slander's livery
a dying life to living infamy
poor helpless help the treasure stol'n away
to burn the guiltless casket where it lay
'well well dear collatine thou shalt not know
the stained taste of violated troth
i will not wrong thy true affection so
to flatter thee with an infringed oath
this bastard graff shall never come to growth
he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
that thou art doting father of his fruit
'nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought
nor laugh with his companions at thy state
but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
basely with gold but stol'n from forth thy gate
for me i am the mistress of my fate
and with my trespass never will dispense
till life to death acquit my forced offence
'i will not poison thee with my attaint
nor fold my fault in cleanlycoin'd excuses
my sable ground of sin i will not paint
to hide the truth of this false night's abuses
my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices
as from a mountainspring that feeds a dale
shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale'
by this lamenting philomel had ended
the welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow
and solemn night with slow sad gait descended
to ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow
lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow
but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see
and therefore still in night would cloister'd be
revealing day through every cranny spies
and seems to point her out where she sits weeping
to whom she sobbing speaks o eye of eyes
why pry'st thou through my window leave thy peeping
mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping
brand not my forehead with thy piercing light
for day hath nought to do what's done by night'
thus cavils she with every thing she sees
true grief is fond and testy as a child
who wayward once his mood with nought agrees
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
continuance tames the one the other wild
like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
with too much labour drowns for want of skill
so she deepdrenched in a sea of care
holds disputation with each thing she views
and to herself all sorrow doth compare
no object but her passion's strength renews
and as one shifts another straight ensues
sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words
sometime tis mad and too much talk affords
the little birds that tune their morning's joy
make her moans mad with their sweet melody
for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy
sad souls are slain in merry company
grief best is pleased with grief's society
true sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
when with like semblance it is sympathized
'tis double death to drown in ken of shore
he ten times pines that pines beholding food
to see the salve doth make the wound ache more
great grief grieves most at that would do it good
deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood
who being stopp'd the bounding banks o'erflows
grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows
'you mockingbirds quoth she your tunes entomb
within your hollowswelling feather'd breasts
and in my hearing be you mute and dumb
my restless discord loves no stops nor rests
a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests
relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears
'come philomel that sing'st of ravishment
make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair
as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment
so i at each sad strain will strain a tear
and with deep groans the diapason bear
for burdenwise i'll hum on tarquin still
while thou on tereus descant'st better skill
'and whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part
to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i
to imitate thee well against my heart
will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye
who if it wink shall thereon fall and die
these means as frets upon an instrument
shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment
'and for poor bird thou sing'st not in the day
as shaming any eye should thee behold
some dark deep desert seated from the way
that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
will we find out and there we will unfold
to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds
since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds'
as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze
wildly determining which way to fly
or one encompass'd with a winding maze
that cannot tread the way out readily
so with herself is she in mutiny
to live or die which of the twain were better
when life is shamed and death reproach's debtor
'to kill myself quoth she alack what were it
but with my body my poor soul's pollution
they that lose half with greater patience bear it
than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion
that mother tries a merciless conclusion
who having two sweet babes when death takes one
will slay the other and be nurse to none
'my body or my soul which was the dearer
when the one pure the other made divine
whose love of either to myself was nearer
when both were kept for heaven and collatine
ay me the bark peel'd from the lofty pine
his leaves will wither and his sap decay
so must my soul her bark being peel'd away
'her house is sack'd her quiet interrupted
her mansion batter'd by the enemy
her sacred temple spotted spoil'd corrupted
grossly engirt with daring infamy
then let it not be call'd impiety
if in this blemish'd fort i make some hole
through which i may convey this troubled soul
'yet die i will not till my collatine
have heard the cause of my untimely death
that he may vow in that sad hour of mine
revenge on him that made me stop my breath
my stained blood to tarquin i'll bequeath
which by him tainted shall for him be spent
and as his due writ in my testament
'my honour i'll bequeath unto the knife
that wounds my body so dishonoured
'tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life
the one will live the other being dead
so of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred
for in my death i murder shameful scorn
my shame so dead mine honour is newborn
'dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost
what legacy shall i bequeath to thee
my resolution love shall be thy boast
by whose example thou revenged mayest be
how tarquin must be used read it in me
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
and for my sake serve thou false tarquin so
'this brief abridgement of my will i make
my soul and body to the skies and ground
my resolution husband do thou take
mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound
my shame be his that did my fame confound
and all my fame that lives disbursed be
to those that live and think no shame of me
'thou collatine shalt oversee this will
how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill
my life's foul deed my life's fair end shall free it
faint not faint heart but stoutly say so be it'
yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee
thou dead both die and both shall victors be'
this plot of death when sadly she had laid
and wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes
with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid
whose swift obedience to her mistress hies
for fleetwing'd duty with thought's feathers flies
poor lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so
as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow
her mistress she doth give demure goodmorrow
with softslow tongue true mark of modesty
and sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow
for why her face wore sorrow's livery
but durst not ask of her audaciously
why her two suns were cloudeclipsed so
nor why her fair cheeks overwash'd with woe
but as the earth doth weep the sun being set
each flower moisten'd like a melting eye
even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
her circled eyne enforced by sympathy
of those fair suns set in her mistress sky
who in a saltwaved ocean quench their light
which makes the maid weep like the dewy night
a pretty while these pretty creatures stand
like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling
one justly weeps the other takes in hand
no cause but company of her drops spilling
their gentle sex to weep are often willing
grieving themselves to guess at others smarts
and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts
for men have marble women waxen minds
and therefore are they form'd as marble will
the weak oppress'd the impression of strange kinds
is form'd in them by force by fraud or skill
then call them not the authors of their ill
no more than wax shall be accounted evil
wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil
their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain
lays open all the little worms that creep
in men as in a roughgrown grove remain
cavekeeping evils that obscurely sleep
through crystal walls each little mote will peep
though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks
poor women's faces are their own fault's books
no man inveigh against the wither'd flower
but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd
not that devour'd but that which doth devour
is worthy blame o let it not be hild
poor women's faults that they are so fulfill'd
with men's abuses those proud lords to blame
make weakmade women tenants to their shame
the precedent whereof in lucrece view
assail'd by night with circumstances strong
of present death and shame that might ensue
by that her death to do her husband wrong
such danger to resistance did belong
that dying fear through all her body spread
and who cannot abuse a body dead
by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak
to the poor counterfeit of her complaining
'my girl quoth she on what occasion break
those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are
raining
if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining
know gentle wench it small avails my mood
if tears could help mine own would do me good
'but tell me girl when went'and there she stay'd
till after a deep groan'tarquin from hence'
'madam ere i was up replied the maid
'the more to blame my sluggard negligence
yet with the fault i thus far can dispense
myself was stirring ere the break of day
and ere i rose was tarquin gone away
'but lady if your maid may be so bold
she would request to know your heaviness'
'o peace quoth lucrece if it should be told
the repetition cannot make it less
for more it is than i can well express
and that deep torture may be call'd a hell
when more is felt than one hath power to tell
'go get me hither paper ink and pen
yet save that labour for i have them here
what should i say one of my husband's men
bid thou be ready by and by to bear
a letter to my lord my love my dear
bid him with speed prepare to carry it
the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ'
her maid is gone and she prepares to write
first hovering o'er the paper with her quill
conceit and grief an eager combat fight
what wit sets down is blotted straight with will
this is too curiousgood this blunt and ill
much like a press of people at a door
throng her inventions which shall go before
at last she thus begins thou worthy lord
of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee
health to thy person next vouchsafe t afford
if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see
some present speed to come and visit me
so i commend me from our house in grief
my woes are tedious though my words are brief'
here folds she up the tenor of her woe
her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
by this short schedule collatine may know
her grief but not her grief's true quality
she dares not thereof make discovery
lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse
besides the life and feeling of her passion
she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her
when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
of her disgrace the better so to clear her
from that suspicion which the world might bear her
to shun this blot she would not blot the letter
with words till action might become them better
to see sad sights moves more than hear them told
for then eye interprets to the ear
the heavy motion that it doth behold
when every part a part of woe doth bear
'tis but a part of sorrow that we hear
deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words
her letter now is seal'd and on it writ
'at ardea to my lord with more than haste'
the post attends and she delivers it
charging the sourfaced groom to hie as fast
as lagging fowls before the northern blast
speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems
extremity still urgeth such extremes
the homely villain court'sies to her low
and blushing on her with a steadfast eye
receives the scroll without or yea or no
and forth with bashful innocence doth hie
but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
imagine every eye beholds their blame
for lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame
when silly groom god wot it was defect
of spirit life and bold audacity
such harmless creatures have a true respect
to talk in deeds while others saucily
promise more speed but do it leisurely
even so this pattern of the wornout age
pawn'd honest looks but laid no words to gage
his kindled duty kindled her mistrust
that two red fires in both their faces blazed
she thought he blush'd as knowing tarquin's lust
and blushing with him wistly on him gazed
her earnest eye did make him more amazed
the more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish
the more she thought he spied in her some blemish
but long she thinks till he return again
and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone
the weary time she cannot entertain
for now tis stale to sigh to weep and groan
so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan
that she her plaints a little while doth stay
pausing for means to mourn some newer way
at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
of skilful painting made for priam's troy
before the which is drawn the power of greece
for helen's rape the city to destroy
threatening cloudkissing ilion with annoy
which the conceited painter drew so proud
as heaven it seem'd to kiss the turrets bow'd
a thousand lamentable objects there
in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life
many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear
shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife
the red blood reek'd to show the painter's strife
and dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights
like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights
there might you see the labouring pioner
begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust
and from the towers of troy there would appear
the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust
gazing upon the greeks with little lust
such sweet observance in this work was had
that one might see those faroff eyes look sad
in great commanders grace and majesty
you might behold triumphing in their faces
in youth quick bearing and dexterity
pale cowards marching on with trembling paces
which heartless peasants did so well resemble
that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble
in ajax and ulysses o what art
of physiognomy might one behold
the face of either cipher'd either's heart
their face their manners most expressly told
in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd
but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent
show'd deep regard and smiling government
there pleading might you see grave nestor stand
as twere encouraging the greeks to fight
making such sober action with his hand
that it beguiled attention charm'd the sight
in speech it seem'd his beard all silver white
wagg'd up and down and from his lips did fly
thin winding breath which purl'd up to the sky
about him were a press of gaping faces
which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice
all jointly listening but with several graces
as if some mermaid did their ears entice
some high some low the painter was so nice
the scalps of many almost hid behind
to jump up higher seem'd to mock the mind
here one man's hand lean'd on another's head
his nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear
here one being throng'd bears back all boll'n and
red
another smother'd seems to pelt and swear
and in their rage such signs of rage they bear
as but for loss of nestor's golden words
it seem'd they would debate with angry swords
for much imaginary work was there
conceit deceitful so compact so kind
that for achilles image stood his spear
griped in an armed hand himself behind
was left unseen save to the eye of mind
a hand a foot a face a leg a head
stood for the whole to be imagined
and from the walls of strongbesieged troy
when their brave hope bold hector march'd to
field
stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
and to their hope they such odd action yield
that through their light joy seemed to appear
like bright things stain'd a kind of heavy fear
and from the strand of dardan where they fought
to simois reedy banks the red blood ran
whose waves to imitate the battle sought
with swelling ridges and their ranks began
to break upon the galled shore and than
retire again till meeting greater ranks
they join and shoot their foam at simois banks
to this wellpainted piece is lucrece come
to find a face where all distress is stell'd
many she sees where cares have carved some
but none where all distress and dolour dwell'd
till she despairing hecuba beheld
staring on priam's wounds with her old eyes
which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies
in her the painter had anatomized
time's ruin beauty's wreck and grim care's reign
her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised
of what she was no semblance did remain
her blue blood changed to black in every vein
wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed
show'd life imprison'd in a body dead
on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes
and shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes
who nothing wants to answer her but cries
and bitter words to ban her cruel foes
the painter was no god to lend her those
and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong
to give her so much grief and not a tongue
'poor instrument quoth she'without a sound
i'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue
and drop sweet balm in priam's painted wound
and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong
and with my tears quench troy that burns so long
and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
of all the greeks that are thine enemies
'show me the strumpet that began this stir
that with my nails her beauty i may tear
thy heat of lust fond paris did incur
this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear
thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here
and here in troy for trespass of thine eye
the sire the son the dame and daughter die
'why should the private pleasure of some one
become the public plague of many moe
let sin alone committed light alone
upon his head that hath transgressed so
let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe
for one's offence why should so many fall
to plague a private sin in general
'lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies
here manly hector faints here troilus swounds
here friend by friend in bloody channel lies
and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds
and one man's lust these many lives confounds
had doting priam cheque'd his son's desire
troy had been bright with fame and not with fire'
here feelingly she weeps troy's painted woes
for sorrow like a heavyhanging bell
once set on ringing with his own weight goes
then little strength rings out the doleful knell
so lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell
to pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow
she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow
she throws her eyes about the painting round
and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament
at last she sees a wretched image bound
that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent
his face though full of cares yet show'd content
onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes
so mild that patience seem'd to scorn his woes
in him the painter labour'd with his skill
to hide deceit and give the harmless show
an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still
a brow unbent that seem'd to welcome woe
cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
that blushing red no guilty instance gave
nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have
but like a constant and confirmed devil
he entertain'd a show so seeming just
and therein so ensconced his secret evil
that jealousy itself could not mistrust
falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust
into so bright a day such blackfaced storms
or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms
the wellskill'd workman this mild image drew
for perjured sinon whose enchanting story
the credulous old priam after slew
whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
of richbuilt ilion that the skies were sorry
and little stars shot from their fixed places
when their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces
this picture she advisedly perused
and chid the painter for his wondrous skill
saying some shape in sinon's was abused
so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill
and still on him she gazed and gazing still
such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
that she concludes the picture was belied
'it cannot be quoth she'that so much guile'
she would have said can lurk in such a look'
but tarquin's shape came in her mind the while
and from her tongue can lurk from cannot took
'it cannot be she in that sense forsook
and turn'd it thus it cannot be i find
but such a face should bear a wicked mind
'for even as subtle sinon here is painted
so sobersad so weary and so mild
as if with grief or travail he had fainted
to me came tarquin armed so beguiled
with outward honesty but yet defiled
with inward vice as priam him did cherish
so did i tarquin so my troy did perish
'look look how listening priam wets his eyes
to see those borrow'd tears that sinon sheds
priam why art thou old and yet not wise
for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds
his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds
those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity
are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city
'such devils steal effects from lightless hell
for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold
and in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell
these contraries such unity do hold
only to flatter fools and make them bold
so priam's trust false sinon's tears doth flatter
that he finds means to burn his troy with water'
here all enraged such passion her assails
that patience is quite beaten from her breast
she tears the senseless sinon with her nails
comparing him to that unhappy guest
whose deed hath made herself herself detest
at last she smilingly with this gives o'er
'fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore'
thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow
and time doth weary time with her complaining
she looks for night and then she longs for morrow
and both she thinks too long with her remaining
short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining
though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps
and they that watch see time how slow it creeps
which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought
that she with painted images hath spent
being from the feeling of her own grief brought
by deep surmise of others detriment
losing her woes in shows of discontent
it easeth some though none it ever cured
to think their dolour others have endured
but now the mindful messenger come back
brings home his lord and other company
who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black
and round about her tearstained eye
blue circles stream'd like rainbows in the sky
these watergalls in her dim element
foretell new storms to those already spent
which when her sadbeholding husband saw
amazedly in her sad face he stares
her eyes though sod in tears look'd red and raw
her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares
he hath no power to ask her how she fares
both stood like old acquaintance in a trance
met far from home wondering each other's chance
at last he takes her by the bloodless hand
and thus begins what uncouth ill event
hath thee befall'n that thou dost trembling stand
sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent
why art thou thus attired in discontent
unmask dear dear this moody heaviness
and tell thy grief that we may give redress'
three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
ere once she can discharge one word of woe
at length address'd to answer his desire
she modestly prepares to let them know
her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe
while collatine and his consorted lords
with sad attention long to hear her words
and now this pale swan in her watery nest
begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
'few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best
where no excuse can give the fault amending
in me moe woes than words are now depending
and my laments would be drawn out too long
to tell them all with one poor tired tongue
'then be this all the task it hath to say
dear husband in the interest of thy bed
a stranger came and on that pillow lay
where thou was wont to rest thy weary head
and what wrong else may be imagined
by foul enforcement might be done to me
from that alas thy lucrece is not free
'for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight
with shining falchion in my chamber came
a creeping creature with a flaming light
and softly cried awake thou roman dame
and entertain my love else lasting shame
on thee and thine this night i will inflict
if thou my love's desire do contradict
 for some hardfavour'd groom of thine quoth he
'unless thou yoke thy liking to my will
i'll murder straight and then i'll slaughter thee
and swear i found you where you did fulfil
the loathsome act of lust and so did kill
the lechers in their deed this act will be
my fame and thy perpetual infamy'
'with this i did begin to start and cry
and then against my heart he sets his sword
swearing unless i took all patiently
i should not live to speak another word
so should my shame still rest upon record
and never be forgot in mighty rome
th adulterate death of lucrece and her groom
'mine enemy was strong my poor self weak
and far the weaker with so strong a fear
my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak
no rightful plea might plead for justice there
his scarlet lust came evidence to swear
that my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes
and when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies
'o teach me how to make mine own excuse
or at the least this refuge let me find
though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse
immaculate and spotless is my mind
that was not forced that never was inclined
to accessary yieldings but still pure
doth in her poison'd closet yet endure'
lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss
with head declined and voice damm'd up with woe
with sad set eyes and wretched arms across
from lips newwaxen pale begins to blow
the grief away that stops his answer so
but wretched as he is he strives in vain
what he breathes out his breath drinks up again
as through an arch the violent roaring tide
outruns the eye that doth behold his haste
yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
back to the strait that forced him on so fast
in rage sent out recall'd in rage being past
even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw
to push grief on and back the same grief draw
which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth
and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh
'dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
another power no flood by raining slaketh
my woe too sensible thy passion maketh
more feelingpainful let it then suffice
to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes
'and for my sake when i might charm thee so
for she that was thy lucrece now attend me
be suddenly revenged on my foe
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me
comes all too late yet let the traitor die
for sparing justice feeds iniquity
'but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she
speaking to those that came with collatine
'shall plight your honourable faiths to me
with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine
for tis a meritorious fair design
to chase injustice with revengeful arms
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms'
at this request with noble disposition
each present lord began to promise aid
as bound in knighthood to her imposition
longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd
but she that yet her sad task hath not said
the protestation stops o speak  quoth she
'how may this forced stain be wiped from me
'what is the quality of mine offence
being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance
may my pure mind with the foul act dispense
my lowdeclined honour to advance
may any terms acquit me from this chance
the poison'd fountain clears itself again
and why not i from this compelled stain'
with this they all at once began to say
her body's stain her mind untainted clears
while with a joyless smile she turns away
the face that map which deep impression bears
of hard misfortune carved in it with tears
'no no quoth she no dame hereafter living
by my excuse shall claim excuse's giving'
here with a sigh as if her heart would break
she throws forth tarquin's name he he she says
but more than he her poor tongue could not speak
till after many accents and delays
untimely breathings sick and short assays
she utters this he he fair lords tis he
that guides this hand to give this wound to me'
even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed
that blow did that it from the deep unrest
of that polluted prison where it breathed
her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly
life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny
stonestill astonish'd with this deadly deed
stood collatine and all his lordly crew
till lucrece father that beholds her bleed
himself on her selfslaughter'd body threw
and from the purple fountain brutus drew
the murderous knife and as it left the place
her blood in poor revenge held it in chase
and bubbling from her breast it doth divide
in two slow rivers that the crimson blood
circles her body in on every side
who like a latesack'd island vastly stood
bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood
some of her blood still pure and red remain'd
and some look'd black and that false tarquin stain'd
about the mourning and congealed face
of that black blood a watery rigol goes
which seems to weep upon the tainted place
and ever since as pitying lucrece woes
corrupted blood some watery token shows
and blood untainted still doth red abide
blushing at that which is so putrified
'daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries
'that life was mine which thou hast here deprived
if in the child the father's image lies
where shall i live now lucrece is unlived
thou wast not to this end from me derived
if children predecease progenitors
we are their offspring and they none of ours
'poor broken glass i often did behold
in thy sweet semblance my old age new born
but now that fresh fair mirror dim and old
shows me a bareboned death by time outworn
o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn
and shivered all the beauty of my glass
that i no more can see what once i was
'o time cease thou thy course and last no longer
if they surcease to be that should survive
shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
and leave the faltering feeble souls alive
the old bees die the young possess their hive
then live sweet lucrece live again and see
thy father die and not thy father thee
by this starts collatine as from a dream
and bids lucretius give his sorrow place
and then in keycold lucrece bleeding stream
he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face
and counterfeits to die with her a space
till manly shame bids him possess his breath
and live to be revenged on her death
the deep vexation of his inward soul
hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue
who mad that sorrow should his use control
or keep him from hearteasing words so long
begins to talk but through his lips do throng
weak words so thick come in his poor heart's aid
that no man could distinguish what he said
yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain
but through his teeth as if the name he tore
this windy tempest till it blow up rain
held back his sorrow's tide to make it more
at last it rains and busy winds give o'er
then son and father weep with equal strife
who should weep most for daughter or for wife
the one doth call her his the other his
yet neither may possess the claim they lay
the father says she's mine o mine she is'
replies her husband do not take away
my sorrow's interest let no mourner say
he weeps for her for she was only mine
and only must be wail'd by collatine'
'o quoth lucretius i did give that life
which she too early and too late hath spill'd'
'woe woe quoth collatine she was my wife
i owed her and tis mine that she hath kill'd'
'my daughter and my wife with clamours fill'd
the dispersed air who holding lucrece life
answer'd their cries my daughter and my wife'
brutus who pluck'd the knife from lucrece side
seeing such emulation in their woe
began to clothe his wit in state and pride
burying in lucrece wound his folly's show
he with the romans was esteemed so
as sillyjeering idiots are with kings
for sportive words and uttering foolish things
but now he throws that shallow habit by
wherein deep policy did him disguise
and arm'd his longhid wits advisedly
to cheque the tears in collatinus eyes
'thou wronged lord of rome quoth be arise
let my unsounded self supposed a fool
now set thy longexperienced wit to school
'why collatine is woe the cure for woe
do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds
is it revenge to give thyself a blow
for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
such childish humour from weak minds proceeds
thy wretched wife mistook the matter so
to slay herself that should have slain her foe
'courageous roman do not steep thy heart
in such relenting dew of lamentations
but kneel with me and help to bear thy part
to rouse our roman gods with invocations
that they will suffer these abominations
since rome herself in them doth stand disgraced
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased
'now by the capitol that we adore
and by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd
by heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's
store
by all our country rights in rome maintain'd
and by chaste lucrece soul that late complain'd
her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife
we will revenge the death of this true wife'
this said he struck his hand upon his breast
and kiss'd the fatal knife to end his vow
and to his protestation urged the rest
who wondering at him did his words allow
then jointly to the ground their knees they bow
and that deep vow which brutus made before
he doth again repeat and that they swore
when they had sworn to this advised doom
they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence
to show her bleeding body thorough rome
and so to publish tarquin's foul offence
which being done with speedy diligence
the romans plausibly did give consent
to tarquin's everlasting banishment
 sonnets
to the only begetter of
these insuing sonnets
mr w h all happiness
and that eternity
promised by
our everliving poet wisheth
the wellwishing
adventurer in
setting forth
t t
i
from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feed'st thy light'st flame with selfsubstantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl makest waste in niggarding
 pity the world or else this glutton be
 to eat the world's due by the grave and thee
ii
when forty winters shall beseige thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held
then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deepsunken eyes
were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
proving his beauty by succession thine
 this were to be new made when thou art old
 and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold
iii
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his selflove to stop posterity
thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shall see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
 but if thou live remember'd not to be
 die single and thine image dies with thee
iv
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thyself thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thyself alone
thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
 thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee
 which used lives th executor to be
v
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for neverresting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where
then were not summer's distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
 but flowers distill'd though they with winter meet
 leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
vi
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beauty's treasure ere it be selfkill'd
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
that's for thyself to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thyself were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
 be not selfwill'd for thou art much too fair
 to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir
vii
lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his newappearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climb'd the steepup heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
 so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
 unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son
viii
music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly
or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of welltuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
 whose speechless song being many seeming one
 sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none'
ix
is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
that thou consumest thyself in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by children's eyes her husband's shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beauty's waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
 no love toward others in that bosom sits
 that on himself such murderous shame commits
x
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
who for thyself art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lovest is most evident
for thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
that gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thyself at least kindhearted prove
 make thee another self for love of me
 that beauty still may live in thine or thee
xi
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endow'd she gave the more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
 she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
 thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
xii
when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silver'd o'er with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
 and nothing gainst time's scythe can make defence
 save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
xiii
o that you were yourself but love you are
no longer yours than you yourself here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
yourself again after yourself's decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winter's day
and barren rage of death's eternal cold
 o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
 you had a father let your son say so
xiv
not from the stars do i my judgment pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
 or else of thee this i prognosticate
 thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date
xv
when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and cheque'd even by the selfsame sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
 and all in war with time for love of you
 as he takes from you i engraft you new
xvi
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify yourself in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live yourself in eyes of men
 to give away yourself keeps yourself still
 and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
xvii
who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were fill'd with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces'
so should my papers yellow'd with their age
be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
 but were some child of yours alive that time
 you should live twice in it and in my rhyme
xviii
shall i compare thee to a summer's day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimm'd
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growest
 so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
 so long lives this and this gives life to thee
xix
devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
and do whate'er thou wilt swiftfooted time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty's pattern to succeeding men
 yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
 my love shall in my verse ever live young
xx
a woman's face with nature's own hand painted
hast thou the mastermistress of my passion
a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false women's fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
 but since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure
 mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
xxi
so is it not with me as with that muse
stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven itself for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
with april's firstborn flowers and all things rare
that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air
 let them say more than like of hearsay well
 i will not praise that purpose not to sell
xxii
my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee time's furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for myself but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
 presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
 thou gavest me thine not to give back again
xxiii
as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put besides his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of love's rite
and in mine own love's strength seem to decay
o'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might
o let my books be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more express'd
 o learn to read what silent love hath writ
 to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit
xxiv
mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
thy beauty's form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein tis held
and perspective it is the painter's art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
 yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
 they draw but what they see know not the heart
xxv
let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlook'd for joy in that i honour most
great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the sun's eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foil'd
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toil'd
 then happy i that love and am beloved
 where i may not remove nor be removed
xxvi
lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tatter'd loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
 then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
 till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
xxvii
weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear repose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when body's work's expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my soul's imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
 lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
 for thee and for myself no quiet find
xxviii
how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarr'd the benefit of rest
when day's oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppress'd
and each though enemies to either's reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please them thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swartcomplexion'd night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
 and night doth nightly make grief's strength
 seem stronger
xxix
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possess'd
desiring this man's art and that man's scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
 for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
 that then i scorn to change my state with kings
xxx
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe
and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of forebemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
 but if the while i think on thee dear friend
 all losses are restored and sorrows end
xxxi
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all love's loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
 their images i loved i view in thee
 and thou all they hast all the all of me
xxxii
if thou survive my wellcontented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more resurvey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bettering of the time
and though they be outstripp'd by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
 but since he died and poets better prove
 theirs for their style i'll read his for his love'
xxxiii
full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendor on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now
 yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
 suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth
xxxiv
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
the offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offence's cross
 ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
 and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
xxxv
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
myself corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and gainst myself a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
 that i an accessary needs must be
 to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
xxxvi
let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not love's sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
 but do not so i love thee in such sort
 as thou being mine mine is thy good report
xxxvii
as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
 look what is best that best i wish in thee
 this wish i have then ten times happy me
xxxviii
how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thyself the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thyself dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
 if my slight muse do please these curious days
 the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
xxxix
o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is t but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deservest alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
 and that thou teachest how to make one twain
 by praising him here who doth hence remain
xl
take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
by wilful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear love's wrong than hate's known injury
 lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
 kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
xli
those petty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what woman's son
will sourly leave her till she have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear
and chide try beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
 hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
 thine by thy beauty being false to me
xlii
that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
 but here's the joy my friend and i are one
 sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
xliii
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
 all days are nights to see till i see thee
 and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
xliv
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend time's leisure with my moan
 receiving nought by elements so slow
 but heavy tears badges of either's woe
xlv
the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these presentabsent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy
until life's composition be recured
by those swift messengers return'd from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
 this told i joy but then no longer glad
 i send them back again and straight grow sad
xlvi
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to cide this title is impanneled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
 as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
 and my heart's right thy inward love of heart
xlvii
betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famish'd for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my love's picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my heart's guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thyself away art resent still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
 or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
 awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight
xlviii
how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not lock'd up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
 and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear
 for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
xlix
against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
call'd to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against myself uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
 to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
 since why to love i can allege no cause
l
how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travel's end
doth teach that ease and that repose to say
'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
 for that same groan doth put this in my mind
 my grief lies onward and my joy behind
li
thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
 since from thee going he went wilfulslow
 towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go
lii
so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in the long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprison'd pride
 blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
 being had to triumph being lack'd to hope
liii
what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helen's cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
 in all external grace you have some part
 but you like none none you for constant heart
liv
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the cankerblooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwoo'd and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
 and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
 when that shall fade my verse distills your truth
lv
not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
'gainst death and alloblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
 so till the judgment that yourself arise
 you live in this and dwell in lover's eyes
lvi
sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but today by feeding is allay'd
tomorrow sharpen'd in his former might
so love be thou although today thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
tomorrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
 else call it winter which being full of care
 makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd more rare
lvii
being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
 so true a fool is love that in your will
 though you do any thing he thinks no ill
lviii
that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand the account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
the imprison'd absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you yourself may privilege your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime
 i am to wait though waiting so be hell
 not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
lix
if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amiss
the second burden of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
 o sure i am the wits of former days
 to subjects worse have given admiring praise
lx
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd
crooked elipses gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
 and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
 praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
lxi
is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenor of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
 for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
 from me far off with others all too near
lxii
sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for myself mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me myself indeed
beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity
mine own selflove quite contrary i read
self so selfloving were iniquity
 tis thee myself that for myself i praise
 painting my age with beauty of thy days
lxiii
against my love shall be as i am now
with time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn
when hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travell'd on to age's steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now he's king
are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
 his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
 and they shall live and he in them still green
lxiv
when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see downrazed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state itself confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away
 this thought is as a death which cannot choose
 but weep to have that which it fears to lose
lxv
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
against the wreckful siege of battering days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
 o none unless this miracle have might
 that in black ink my love may still shine bright
lxvi
tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and guilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tonguetied by authority
and folly doctorlike controlling skill
and simple truth miscall'd simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
 tired with all these from these would i be gone
 save that to die i leave my love alone
lxvii
ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace itself with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeing of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
 o him she stores to show what wealth she had
 in days long since before these last so bad
lxviii
thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before the bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament itself and true
making no summer of another's green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
 and him as for a map doth nature store
 to show false art what beauty was of yore
lxix
those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
 but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
 the solve is this that thou dost common grow
lxx
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slander's mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being woo'd of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days
either not assail'd or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
 if some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show
 then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
lxxi
no longer mourn for me when i am dead
then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
 lest the wise world should look into your moan
 and mock you with me after i am gone
lxxii
o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
 for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
 and so should you to love things nothing worth
lxxiii
that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the deathbed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourish'd by
 this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
 to love that well which thou must leave ere long
lxxiv
but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretch's knife
too base of thee to be remembered
 the worth of that is that which it contains
 and that is this and this with thee remains
lxxv
so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweetseason'd showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
then better'd that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
 thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
 or gluttoning on all or all away
lxxvi
why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to newfound methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
 for as the sun is daily new and old
 so is my love still telling what is told
lxxvii
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
the vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory can not contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
those children nursed deliver'd from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
 these offices so oft as thou wilt look
 shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
lxxviii
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learned's wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
 but thou art all my art and dost advance
 as high as learning my rude ignorance
lxxix
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decay'd
and my sick muse doth give another place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behavior beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
 then thank him not for that which he doth say
 since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
lxxx
o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wreck'd i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
 then if he thrive and i be cast away
 the worst was this my love was my decay
lxxxi
or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i once gone to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'erread
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
 you still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen
 where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
lxxxii
i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy truetelling friend
 and their gross painting might be better used
 where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
lxxxiii
i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
the barren tender of a poet's debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you yourself being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
 there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
 than both your poets can in praise devise
lxxxiv
who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
 you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
 being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
lxxxv
my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
and like unletter'd clerk still cry amen'
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polish'd form of wellrefined pen
hearing you praised i say 'tis so tis true'
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
 then others for the breath of words respect
 me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
lxxxvi
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
 but when your countenance fill'd up his line
 then lack'd i matter that enfeebled mine
lxxxvii
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgment making
 thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
 in sleep a king but waking no such matter
lxxxviii
when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against myself i'll fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults conceal'd wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to myself i do
doing thee vantage doublevantage me
 such is my love to thee i so belong
 that for thy right myself will bear all wrong
lxxxix
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as i'll myself disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
 for thee against myself i'll vow debate
 for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
xc
then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an afterloss
ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune's might
 and other strains of woe which now seem woe
 compared with loss of thee will not seem so
xci
some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their bodies force
some in their garments though newfangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments cost
of more delight than hawks or horses be
and having thee of all men's pride i boast
 wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
 all this away and me most wretched make
xcii
but do thy worst to steal thyself away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love happy to die
 but what's so blessedfair that fears no blot
 thou mayst be false and yet i know it not
xciii
so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love to me though alter'd new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in many's looks the false heart's history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
 how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
 if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
xciv
they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
and husband nature's riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
 for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
 lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
xcv
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
and all things turn to fair that eyes can see
 take heed dear heart of this large privilege
 the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge
xcvi
some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteem'd
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deem'd
how many lambs might the stem wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
 but do not so i love thee in such sort
 as thou being mine mine is thy good report
xcvii
how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness every where
and yet this time removed was summer's time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widow'd wombs after their lords decease
yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
 or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
 that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
xcviii
from you have i been absent in the spring
when proudpied april dress'd in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer's story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did i wonder at the lily's white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
 yet seem'd it winter still and you away
 as with your shadow i with these did play
xcix
the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my love's breath the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
 more flowers i noted yet i none could see
 but sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee
c
where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make time's spoils despised every where
 give my love fame faster than time wastes life
 so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife
ci
o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
'truth needs no colour with his colour fix'd
beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay
but best is best if never intermix'd'
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
 then do thy office muse i teach thee how
 to make him seem long hence as he shows now
cii
my love is strengthen'd though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owner's tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summer's front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
 therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
 because i would not dull you with my song
ciii
alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that overgoes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
 and more much more than in my verse can sit
 your own glass shows you when you look in it
civ
to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
 for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
 ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
cv
let not my love be call'd idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love today tomorrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
'fair kind and true is all my argument
'fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
 fair kind and true have often lived alone
 which three till now never kept seat in one
cvi
when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have express'd
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they look'd but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
 for we which now behold these present days
 had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
cvii
not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
 and thou in this shalt find thy monument
 when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
cviii
what's in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
what's new to speak what new to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say o'er the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallow'd thy fair name
so that eternal love in love's fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
 finding the first conceit of love there bred
 where time and outward form would show it dead
cix
o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seem'd my flame to qualify
as easy might i from myself depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that myself bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reign'd
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stain'd
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
 for nothing this wide universe i call
 save thou my rose in it thou art my all
cx
alas tis true i have gone here and there
and made myself a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have look'd on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
 then give me welcome next my heaven the best
 even to thy pure and most most loving breast
cxi
o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyer's hand
pity me then and wish i were renew'd
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
 pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
 even that your pity is enough to cure me
cxii
your love and pity doth the impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you o'ergreen my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others voices that my adder's sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
 you are so strongly in my purpose bred
 that all the world besides methinks are dead
cxiii
since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
 incapable of more replete with you
 my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue
cxiv
or whether doth my mind being crown'd with you
drink up the monarch's plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
o'tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
 if it be poison'd tis the lesser sin
 that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
cxv
those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose million'd accidents
creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
divert strong minds to the course of altering things
alas why fearing of time's tyranny
might i not then say now i love you best'
when i was certain o'er incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
 love is a babe then might i not say so
 to give full growth to that which still doth grow
cxvi
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an everfixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
 if this be error and upon me proved
 i never writ nor no man ever loved
cxvii
accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dearpurchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your waken'd hate
 since my appeal says i did strive to prove
 the constancy and virtue of your love
cxviii
like as to make our appetites more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being tuff of your ne'ercloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love to anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
 but thence i learn and find the lesson true
 drugs poison him that so fell sick of you
cxix
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw myself to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruin'd love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
 so i return rebuked to my content
 and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
cxx
that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours you've pass'd a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have remember'd
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tender'd
the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits
 but that your trespass now becomes a fee
 mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
cxxi
'tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
not by our feeling but by others seeing
for why should others false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
 unless this general evil they maintain
 all men are bad and in their badness reign
cxxii
thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full character'd with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be miss'd
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
 to keep an adjunct to remember thee
 were to import forgetfulness in me
cxxiii
no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wondering at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
 this i do vow and this shall ever be
 i will be true despite thy scythe and thee
cxxiv
if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortune's bastard be unfather'd'
as subject to time's love or to time's hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather'd
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of shortnumber'd hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
 to this i witness call the fools of time
 which die for goodness who have lived for crime
cxxv
were t aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which prove more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
 hence thou suborn'd informer a true soul
 when most impeach'd stands least in thy control
cxxvi
o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his sickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
 her audit though delay'd answer'd must be
 and her quietus is to render thee
cxxvii
in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beauty's name
but now is black beauty's successive heir
and beauty slander'd with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on nature's power
fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress brows are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
 yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
 that every tongue says beauty should look so
cxxviii
how oft when thou my music music play'st
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
 since saucy jacks so happy are in this
 give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
cxxix
the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallow'd bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
 all this the world well knows yet none knows well
 to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
cxxx
my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damask'd red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
 and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
 as any she belied with false compare
cxxxi
thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to myself alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on another's neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
 in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
 and thence this slander as i think proceeds
cxxxii
thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
 then will i swear beauty herself is black
 and all they foul that thy complexion lack
cxxxiii
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
is't not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engross'd
of him myself and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd
prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward
but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
 and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
 perforce am thine and all that is in me
cxxxiv
so now i have confess'd that he is thine
and i myself am mortgaged to thy will
myself i'll forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learn'd but suretylike to write for me
under that bond that him as fast doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
 him have i lost thou hast both him and me
 he pays the whole and yet am i not free
cxxxv
whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will'
and will to boot and will in overplus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will'
one will of mine to make thy large will more
 let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
 think all but one and me in that one will'
cxxxvi
if thy soul cheque thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will'
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
'will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with ease we prove
among a number one is reckon'd none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy stores account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
 make but my name thy love and love that still
 and then thou lovest me for my name is will'
cxxxvii
thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
 in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
 and to this false plague are they now transferr'd
cxxxviii
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutor'd youth
unlearned in the world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
 therefore i lie with her and she with me
 and in our faults by lies we flatter'd be
cxxxix
o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my o'erpress'd defense can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
 yet do not so but since i am near slain
 kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
cxl
be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tonguetied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pitywanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this illwresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
 that i may not be so nor thou belied
 bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
cxli
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man
thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
 only my plague thus far i count my gain
 that she that makes me sin awards me pain
cxlii
love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine
robb'd others beds revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lovest those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
 if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
 by selfexample mayst thou be denied
cxliii
lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
one of her feather'd creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infant's discontent
so runn'st thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mother's part kiss me be kind
 so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will'
 if thou turn back and my loud crying still
cxliv
two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
suspect i may but not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
 yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt
 till my bad angel fire my good one out
cxlv
those lips that love's own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said i hate'
to me that languish'd for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
'i hate she alter'd with an end
that follow'd it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
 i hate from hate away she threw
 and saved my life saying not you'
cxlvi
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
 these rebel powers that thee array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more
 so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men
 and death once dead there's no more dying then
cxlvii
my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
the uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and franticmad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are
at random from the truth vainly express'd
 for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
 who art as black as hell as dark as night
cxlviii
o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
love's eye is not so true as all men's no'
how can it o how can love's eye be true
that is so vex'd with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
 o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind
 lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
cxlix
canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against myself with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
revenge upon myself with present moan
what merit do i in myself respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
 but love hate on for now i know thy mind
 those that can see thou lovest and i am blind
cl
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantize of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
 if thy unworthiness raised love in me
 more worthy i to be beloved of thee
cli
love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body's treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
 no want of conscience hold it that i call
 her love for whose dear love i rise and fall
clii
in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
 for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
 to swear against the truth so foul a lie

cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dian's this advantage found
and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valleyfountain of that ground
which borrow'd from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seething bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress eye love's brand newfired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distemper'd guest
 but found no cure the bath for my help lies
 where cupid got new firemy mistress eyes
cliv
the little lovegod lying once asleep
laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warm'd
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men diseased but i my mistress thrall
 came there for cure and this by that i prove
 love's fire heats water water cools not love
 the passionate pilgrim
i
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutor'd youth
unskilful in the world's false forgeries
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although i know my years be past the best
i smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue
outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest
but wherefore says my love that she is young
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is a soothing tongue
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i'll lie with love and love with me
since that our faults in love thus smother'd be
ii
two loves i have of comfort and despair
that like two spirits do suggest me still
my better angel is a man right fair
my worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her fair pride
and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
for being both to me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
the truth i shall not know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out
iii
did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
'gainst whom the world could not hold argument
persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman i forswore but i will prove
thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me
my vow was breath and breath a vapour is
then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine
exhale this vapour vow in thee it is
if broken then it is no fault of mine
if by me broke what fool is not so wise
to break an oath to win a paradise
iv
sweet cytherea sitting by a brook
with young adonis lovely fresh and green
did court the lad with many a lovely look
such looks as none could look but beauty's queen
she told him stories to delight his ear
she showed him favors to allure his eye
to win his heart she touch'd him here and there
touches so soft still conquer chastity
but whether unripe years did want conceit
or he refused to take her figured proffer
the tender nibbler would not touch the bait
but smile and jest at every gentle offer
then fell she on her back fair queen and toward
he rose and ran away ah fool too froward
v
if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
o never faith could hold if not to beauty vow'd
though to myself forsworn to thee i'll constant prove
those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bow'd
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend
if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
thine eye jove's lightning seems thy voice his dreadful
thunder
which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
celestial as thou art o do not love that wrong
to sing heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue
vi
scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn
and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade
when cytherea all in love forlorn
a longing tarriance for adonis made
under an osier growing by a brook
a brook where adon used to cool his spleen
hot was the day she hotter that did look
for his approach that often there had been
anon he comes and throws his mantle by
and stood stark naked on the brook's green brim
the sun look'd on the world with glorious eye
yet not so wistly as this queen on him
he spying her bounced in whereas he stood
'o jove quoth she why was not i a flood'
vii
fair is my love but not so fair as fickle
mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty
brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittle
softer than wax and yet as iron rusty
a lily pale with damask dye to grace her
none fairer nor none falser to deface her
her lips to mine how often hath she joined
between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing
how many tales to please me hath she coined
dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing
yet in the midst of all her pure protestings
her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings
she burn'd with love as straw with fire flameth
she burn'd out love as soon as straw outburneth
she framed the love and yet she foil'd the framing
she bade love last and yet she fell aturning
was this a lover or a lecher whether
bad in the best though excellent in neither
viii
if music and sweet poetry agree
as they must needs the sister and the brother
then must the love be great twixt thee and me
because thou lovest the one and i the other
dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
upon the lute doth ravish human sense
spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
as passing all conceit needs no defence
thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound
that phoebus lute the queen of music makes
and i in deep delight am chiefly drown'd
when as himself to singing he betakes
one god is god of both as poets feign
one knight loves both and both in thee remain
ix
fair was the morn when the fair queen of love
 
paler for sorrow than her milkwhite dove
for adon's sake a youngster proud and wild
her stand she takes upon a steepup hill
anon adonis comes with horn and hounds
she silly queen with more than love's good will
forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds
'once quoth she did i see a fair sweet youth
here in these brakes deepwounded with a boar
deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth
see in my thigh quoth she here was the sore'
she showed hers he saw more wounds than one
and blushing fled and left her all alone
x
sweet rose fair flower untimely pluck'd soon vaded
pluck'd in the bud and vaded in the spring
bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded
fair creature kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting
like a green plum that hangs upon a tree
and falls through wind before the fall should be
i weep for thee and yet no cause i have
for why thou left'st me nothing in thy will
and yet thou left'st me more than i did crave
for why i craved nothing of thee still
o yes dear friend i pardon crave of thee
thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me
xi
venus with young adonis sitting by her
under a myrtle shade began to woo him
she told the youngling how god mars did try her
and as he fell to her so fell she to him
'even thus quoth she the warlike god embraced me'
and then she clipp'd adonis in her arms
'even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me'
as if the boy should use like loving charms
'even thus quoth she he seized on my lips'
and with her lips on his did act the seizure
and as she fetched breath away he skips
and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure
ah that i had my lady at this bay
to kiss and clip me till i run away
xii
crabbed age and youth cannot live together
youth is full of pleasance age is full of care
youth like summer morn age like winter weather
youth like summer brave age like winter bare
youth is full of sport age's breath is short
youth is nimble age is lame
youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold
youth is wild and age is tame
age i do abhor thee youth i do adore thee
o my love my love is young
age i do defy thee o sweet shepherd hie thee
for methinks thou stay'st too long
xiii
beauty is but a vain and doubtful good
a shining gloss that vadeth suddenly
a flower that dies when first it gins to bud
a brittle glass that's broken presently
a doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower
lost vaded broken dead within an hour
and as goods lost are seld or never found
as vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh
as flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground
as broken glass no cement can redress
so beauty blemish'd once's for ever lost
in spite of physic painting pain and cost
xiv
good night good rest ah neither be my share
she bade good night that kept my rest away
and daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care
to descant on the doubts of my decay
'farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow'
fare well i could not for i supp'd with sorrow
yet at my parting sweetly did she smile
in scorn or friendship nill i construe whether
't may be she joy'd to jest at my exile
't may be again to make me wander thither
'wander a word for shadows like myself
as take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf
xv
lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east
my heart doth charge the watch the morning rise
doth cite each moving sense from idle rest
not daring trust the office of mine eyes
while philomela sits and sings i sit and mark
and wish her lays were tuned like the lark
for she doth welcome daylight with her ditty
and drives away dark dismaldreaming night
the night so pack'd i post unto my pretty
heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight
sorrow changed to solace solace mix'd with sorrow
for why she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow
were i with her the night would post too soon
but now are minutes added to the hours
to spite me now each minute seems a moon
yet not for me shine sun to succor flowers
pack night peep day good day of night now borrow
short night tonight and length thyself tomorrow
 sonnets to sundry notes of music

it was a lording's daughter the fairest one of three
that liked of her master as well as well might be
till looking on an englishman the fair'st that eye could see
her fancy fell aturning
long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
to leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight
to put in practise either alas it was a spite
unto the silly damsel
but one must be refused more mickle was the pain
that nothing could be used to turn them both to gain
for of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain
alas she could not help it
thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away
then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay
for now my song is ended
xvii
on a day alack the day
love whose month was ever may
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen gan passage find
that the lover sick to death
wish'd himself the heaven's breath
'air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would i might triumph so
but alas my hand hath sworn
ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
youth so apt to pluck a sweet
thou for whom jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were
and deny himself for jove
turning mortal for thy love'
xviii
my flocks feed not
my ewes breed not
my rams speed not
all is amiss
love's denying
faith's defying
heart's renying
causer of this
all my merry jigs are quite forgot
all my lady's love is lost god wot
where her faith was firmly fix'd in love
there a nay is placed without remove
one silly cross
wrought all my loss
o frowning fortune cursed fickle dame
for now i see
inconstancy
more in women than in men remain
in black mourn i
all fears scorn i
love hath forlorn me
living in thrall
heart is bleeding
all help needing
o cruel speeding
fraughted with gall
my shepherd's pipe can sound no deal
my wether's bell rings doleful knell
my curtail dog that wont to have play'd
plays not at all but seems afraid
my sighs so deep
procure to weep
in howling wise to see my doleful plight
how sighs resound
through heartless ground
like a thousand vanquish'd men in bloody fight
clear wells spring not
sweet birds sing not
green plants bring not
forth their dye
herds stand weeping
flocks all sleeping
nymphs back peeping
fearfully
all our pleasure known to us poor swains
all our merry meetings on the plains
all our evening sport from us is fled
all our love is lost for love is dead
farewell sweet lass
thy like ne'er was
for a sweet content the cause of all my moan
poor corydon
must live alone
other help for him i see that there is none
xix
when as thine eye hath chose the dame
and stall'd the deer that thou shouldst strike
let reason rule things worthy blame
as well as fancy partial might
take counsel of some wiser head
neither too young nor yet unwed
and when thou comest thy tale to tell
smooth not thy tongue with filed talk
lest she some subtle practise smell
a cripple soon can find a halt
but plainly say thou lovest her well
and set thy person forth to sell
what though her frowning brows be bent
her cloudy looks will calm ere night
and then too late she will repent
that thus dissembled her delight
and twice desire ere it be day
that which with scorn she put away
what though she strive to try her strength
and ban and brawl and say thee nay
her feeble force will yield at length
when craft hath taught her thus to say
'had women been so strong as men
in faith you had not had it then'
and to her will frame all thy ways
spare not to spend and chiefly there
where thy desert may merit praise
by ringing in thy lady's ear
the strongest castle tower and town
the golden bullet beats it down
serve always with assured trust
and in thy suit be humble true
unless thy lady prove unjust
press never thou to choose anew
when time shall serve be thou not slack
to proffer though she put thee back
the wiles and guiles that women work
dissembled with an outward show
the tricks and toys that in them lurk
the cock that treads them shall not know
have you not heard it said full oft
a woman's nay doth stand for nought
think women still to strive with men
to sin and never for to saint
there is no heaven by holy then
when time with age doth them attaint
were kisses all the joys in bed
one woman would another wed
but soft enough too much i fear
lest that my mistress hear my song
she will not stick to round me i the ear
to teach my tongue to be so long
yet will she blush here be it said
to hear her secrets so bewray'd
xx
live with me and be my love
and we will all the pleasures prove
that hills and valleys dales and fields
and all the craggy mountains yields
there will we sit upon the rocks
and see the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers by whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals
there will i make thee a bed of roses
with a thousand fragrant posies
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle
a belt of straw and ivy buds
with coral clasps and amber studs
and if these pleasures may thee move
then live with me and be my love
love's answer
if that the world and love were young
and truth in every shepherd's tongue
these pretty pleasures might me move
to live with thee and be thy love
xxi
as it fell upon a day
in the merry month of may
sitting in a pleasant shade
which a grove of myrtles made
beasts did leap and birds did sing
trees did grow and plants did spring
every thing did banish moan
save the nightingale alone
she poor bird as all forlorn
lean'd her breast uptill a thorn
and there sung the dolefull'st ditty
that to hear it was great pity
'fie fie fie now would she cry
'tereu tereu by and by
that to hear her so complain
scarce i could from tears refrain
for her griefs so lively shown
made me think upon mine own
ah thought i thou mourn'st in vain
none takes pity on thy pain
senseless trees they cannot hear thee
ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee
king pandion he is dead
all thy friends are lapp'd in lead
all thy fellow birds do sing
careless of thy sorrowing
even so poor bird like thee
none alive will pity me
whilst as fickle fortune smiled
thou and i were both beguiled
every one that flatters thee
is no friend in misery
words are easy like the wind
faithful friends are hard to find
every man will be thy friend
whilst thou hast wherewith to spend
but if store of crowns be scant
no man will supply thy want
if that one be prodigal
bountiful they will him call
and with suchlike flattering
'pity but he were a king'
if he be addict to vice
quickly him they will entice
if to women he be bent
they have at commandement
but if fortune once do frown
then farewell his great renown
they that fawn'd on him before
use his company no more
he that is thy friend indeed
he will help thee in thy need
if thou sorrow he will weep
if thou wake he cannot sleep
thus of every grief in heart
he with thee doth bear a part
these are certain signs to know
faithful friend from flattering foe
 the phoenix and the turtle
 let the bird of loudest lay
 on the sole arabian tree
 herald sad and trumpet be
 to whose sound chaste wings obey
 but thou shrieking harbinger
 foul precurrer of the fiend
 augur of the fever's end
 to this troop come thou not near
 from this session interdict
 every fowl of tyrant wing
 save the eagle feather'd king
 keep the obsequy so strict
 let the priest in surplice white
 that defunctive music can
 be the deathdivining swan
 lest the requiem lack his right
 and thou trebledated crow
 that thy sable gender makest
 with the breath thou givest and takest
 mongst our mourners shalt thou go
 here the anthem doth commence
 love and constancy is dead
 phoenix and the turtle fled
 in a mutual flame from hence
 so they loved as love in twain
 had the essence but in one
 two distincts division none
 number there in love was slain
 hearts remote yet not asunder
 distance and no space was seen
 twixt the turtle and his queen
 but in them it were a wonder
 so between them love did shine
 that the turtle saw his right
 flaming in the phoenix sight
 either was the other's mine
 property was thus appalled
 that the self was not the same
 single nature's double name
 neither two nor one was called
 reason in itself confounded
 saw division grow together
 to themselves yet either neither
 simple were so well compounded
 that it cried how true a twain
 seemeth this concordant one
 love hath reason reason none
 if what parts can so remain
 whereupon it made this threne
 to the phoenix and the dove
 cosupremes and stars of love
 as chorus to their tragic scene
 threnos
 beauty truth and rarity
 grace in all simplicity
 here enclosed in cinders lie
 death is now the phoenix nest
 and the turtle's loyal breast
 to eternity doth rest
 leaving no posterity
 twas not their infirmity
 it was married chastity
 truth may seem but cannot be
 beauty brag but tis not she
 truth and beauty buried be
 to this urn let those repair
 that are either true or fair
 for these dead birds sigh a prayer

right honorable henry wriothesly
earl of southampton and baron of tichfield
right honorable
i know not how i shall offend in dedicating my
unpolished lines to your lordship nor how the world will
censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a
burden only if your honour seem but pleased i account
myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of all idle
hours till i have honoured you with some graver labour but if
the first heir of my invention prove deformed i shall be
sorry it had so noble a godfather and never after ear so
barren a land for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest
i leave it to your honourable survey and your honour to your
heart's content which i wish may always answer your own wish
and the world's hopeful expectation
your honour's in all duty
william shakespeare
even as the sun with purplecolour'd face
had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn
rosecheek'd adonis hied him to the chase
hunting he loved but love he laugh'd to scorn
sickthoughted venus makes amain unto him
and like a boldfaced suitor gins to woo him
'thricefairer than myself thus she began
'the field's chief flower sweet above compare
stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man
more white and red than doves or roses are
nature that made thee with herself at strife
saith that the world hath ending with thy life
'vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed
and rein his proud head to the saddlebow
if thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
a thousand honey secrets shalt thou know
here come and sit where never serpent hisses
and being set i'll smother thee with kisses
'and yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety
but rather famish them amid their plenty
making them red and pale with fresh variety
ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
a summer's day will seem an hour but short
being wasted in such timebeguiling sport'
with this she seizeth on his sweating palm
the precedent of pith and livelihood
and trembling in her passion calls it balm
earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good
being so enraged desire doth lend her force
courageously to pluck him from his horse
over one arm the lusty courser's rein
under her other was the tender boy
who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain
with leaden appetite unapt to toy
she red and hot as coals of glowing fire
he red for shame but frosty in desire
the studded bridle on a ragged bough
nimbly she fastenso how quick is love
the steed is stalled up and even now
to tie the rider she begins to prove
backward she push'd him as she would be thrust
and govern'd him in strength though not in lust
so soon was she along as he was down
each leaning on their elbows and their hips
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
and gins to chide but soon she stops his lips
and kissing speaks with lustful language broken
'if thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open'
he burns with bashful shame she with her tears
doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
to fan and blow them dry again she seeks
he saith she is immodest blames her miss
what follows more she murders with a kiss
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone
shaking her wings devouring all in haste
till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone
even so she kissed his brow his cheek his chin
and where she ends she doth anew begin
forced to content but never to obey
panting he lies and breatheth in her face
she feedeth on the steam as on a prey
and calls it heavenly moisture air of grace
wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
so they were dew'd with such distilling showers
look how a bird lies tangled in a net
so fasten'd in her arms adonis lies
pure shame and awed resistance made him fret
which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
rain added to a river that is rank
perforce will force it overflow the bank
still she entreats and prettily entreats
for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
still is he sullen still he lours and frets
'twixt crimson shame and anger ashypale
being red she loves him best and being white
her best is better'd with a more delight
look how he can she cannot choose but love
and by her fair immortal hand she swears
from his soft bosom never to remove
till he take truce with her contending tears
which long have rain'd making her cheeks all wet
and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt
upon this promise did he raise his chin
like a divedapper peering through a wave
who being look'd on ducks as quickly in
so offers he to give what she did crave
but when her lips were ready for his pay
he winks and turns his lips another way
never did passenger in summer's heat
more thirst for drink than she for this good turn
her help she sees but help she cannot get
she bathes in water yet her fire must burn
'o pity gan she cry flinthearted boy
'tis but a kiss i beg why art thou coy
'i have been woo'd as i entreat thee now
even by the stern and direful god of war
whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow
who conquers where he comes in every jar
yet hath he been my captive and my slave
and begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have
'over my altars hath he hung his lance
his batter'd shield his uncontrolled crest
and for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance
to toy to wanton dally smile and jest
scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
making my arms his field his tent my bed
'thus he that overruled i oversway'd
leading him prisoner in a redrose chain
strongtempered steel his stronger strength obey'd
yet was he servile to my coy disdain
o be not proud nor brag not of thy might
for mastering her that foil'd the god of fight
'touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
though mine be not so fair yet are they red
the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
what seest thou in the ground hold up thy head
look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies
then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes
'art thou ashamed to kiss then wink again
and i will wink so shall the day seem night
love keeps his revels where they are but twain
be bold to play our sport is not in sight
these bluevein'd violets whereon we lean
never can blab nor know not what we mean
'the tender spring upon thy tempting lip
shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted
make use of time let not advantage slip
beauty within itself should not be wasted
fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
rot and consume themselves in little time
'were i hardfavour'd foul or wrinkledold
illnurtured crooked churlish harsh in voice
o'erworn despised rheumatic and cold
thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice
then mightst thou pause for then i were not for thee
but having no defects why dost abhor me
'thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow
mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning
my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
my flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning
my smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt
would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt
'bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear
or like a fairy trip upon the green
or like a nymph with long dishevell'd hair
dance on the sands and yet no footing seen
love is a spirit all compact of fire
not gross to sink but light and will aspire
'witness this primrose bank whereon i lie
these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
from morn till night even where i list to sport me
is love so light sweet boy and may it be
that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee
'is thine own heart to thine own face affected
can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
then woo thyself be of thyself rejected
steal thine own freedom and complain on theft
narcissus so himself himself forsook
and died to kiss his shadow in the brook
'torches are made to light jewels to wear
dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use
herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
things growing to themselves are growth's abuse
seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
thou wast begot to get it is thy duty
'upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed
unless the earth with thy increase be fed
by law of nature thou art bound to breed
that thine may live when thou thyself art dead
and so in spite of death thou dost survive
in that thy likeness still is left alive'
by this the lovesick queen began to sweat
for where they lay the shadow had forsook them
and titan tired in the midday heat
with burning eye did hotly overlook them
wishing adonis had his team to guide
so he were like him and by venus side
and now adonis with a lazy spright
and with a heavy dark disliking eye
his louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight
like misty vapours when they blot the sky
souring his cheeks cries fie no more of love
the sun doth burn my face i must remove'
'ay me quoth venus young and so unkind
what bare excuses makest thou to be gone
i'll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
shall cool the heat of this descending sun
i'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs
if they burn too i'll quench them with my tears
'the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
and lo i lie between that sun and thee
the heat i have from thence doth little harm
thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me
and were i not immortal life were done
between this heavenly and earthly sun
'art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth
art thou a woman's son and canst not feel
what tis to love how want of love tormenteth
o had thy mother borne so hard a mind
she had not brought forth thee but died unkind
'what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
or what great danger dwells upon my suit
what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute
give me one kiss i'll give it thee again
and one for interest if thou wilt have twain
'fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone
wellpainted idol image dun and dead
statue contenting but the eye alone
thing like a man but of no woman bred
thou art no man though of a man's complexion
for men will kiss even by their own direction'
this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
and swelling passion doth provoke a pause
red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong
being judge in love she cannot right her cause
and now she weeps and now she fain would speak
and now her sobs do her intendments break
sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand
now gazeth she on him now on the ground
sometimes her arms infold him like a band
she would he will not in her arms be bound
and when from thence he struggles to be gone
she locks her lily fingers one in one
'fondling she saith since i have hemm'd thee here
within the circuit of this ivory pale
i'll be a park and thou shalt be my deer
feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale
graze on my lips and if those hills be dry
stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie
within this limit is relief enough
sweet bottomgrass and high delightful plain
round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough
to shelter thee from tempest and from rain
then be my deer since i am such a park
no dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark'
at this adonis smiles as in disdain
that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
love made those hollows if himself were slain
he might be buried in a tomb so simple
foreknowing well if there he came to lie
why there love lived and there he could not die
these lovely caves these round enchanting pits
open'd their mouths to swallow venus liking
being mad before how doth she now for wits
struck dead at first what needs a second striking
poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn
to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn
now which way shall she turn what shall she say
her words are done her woes are more increasing
the time is spent her object will away
and from her twining arms doth urge releasing
'pity she cries some favour some remorse'
away he springs and hasteth to his horse
but lo from forth a copse that neighbors by
a breeding jennet lusty young and proud
adonis trampling courser doth espy
and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
the strongneck'd steed being tied unto a tree
breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he
imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
and now his woven girths he breaks asunder
the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder
the iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth
controlling what he was controlled with
his ears upprick'd his braided hanging mane
upon his compass'd crest now stand on end
his nostrils drink the air and forth again
as from a furnace vapours doth he send
his eye which scornfully glisters like fire
shows his hot courage and his high desire
sometime he trots as if he told the steps
with gentle majesty and modest pride
anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
as who should say lo thus my strength is tried
and this i do to captivate the eye
of the fair breeder that is standing by'
what recketh he his rider's angry stir
his flattering holla or his stand i say'
what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
for rich caparisons or trapping gay
he sees his love and nothing else he sees
for nothing else with his proud sight agrees
look when a painter would surpass the life
in limning out a wellproportion'd steed
his art with nature's workmanship at strife
as if the dead the living should exceed
so did this horse excel a common one
in shape in courage colour pace and bone
roundhoof'd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long
broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
look what a horse should have he did not lack
save a proud rider on so proud a back
sometime he scuds far off and there he stares
anon he starts at stirring of a feather
to bid the wind a base he now prepares
and whether he run or fly they know not whether
for through his mane and tail the high wind sings
fanning the hairs who wave like feather'd wings
he looks upon his love and neighs unto her
she answers him as if she knew his mind
being proud as females are to see him woo her
she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
beating his kind embracements with her heels
then like a melancholy malcontent
he veils his tail that like a falling plume
cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume
his love perceiving how he is enraged
grew kinder and his fury was assuaged
his testy master goeth about to take him
when lo the unback'd breeder full of fear
jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
with her the horse and left adonis there
as they were mad unto the wood they hie them
outstripping crows that strive to overfly them
all swoln with chafing down adonis sits
banning his boisterous and unruly beast
and now the happy season once more fits
that lovesick love by pleading may be blest
for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
when it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue
an oven that is stopp'd or river stay'd
burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage
so of concealed sorrow may be said
free vent of words love's fire doth assuage
but when the heart's attorney once is mute
the client breaks as desperate in his suit
he sees her coming and begins to glow
even as a dying coal revives with wind
and with his bonnet hides his angry brow
looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind
taking no notice that she is so nigh
for all askance he holds her in his eye
o what a sight it was wistly to view
how she came stealing to the wayward boy
to note the fighting conflict of her hue
how white and red each other did destroy
but now her cheek was pale and by and by
it flash'd forth fire as lightning from the sky
now was she just before him as he sat
and like a lowly lover down she kneels
with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
her other tender hand his fair cheek feels
his tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print
as apt as newfall'n snow takes any dint
o what a war of looks was then between them
her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing
his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
her eyes woo'd still his eyes disdain'd the wooing
and all this dumb play had his acts made plain
with tears which choruslike her eyes did rain
full gently now she takes him by the hand
a lily prison'd in a gaol of snow
or ivory in an alabaster band
so white a friend engirts so white a foe
this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
show'd like two silver doves that sit abilling
once more the engine of her thoughts began
'o fairest mover on this mortal round
would thou wert as i am and i a man
my heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound
for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee
though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee
'give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it'
'give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it
o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
and being steel'd soft sighs can never grave it
then love's deep groans i never shall regard
because adonis heart hath made mine hard'
'for shame he cries let go and let me go
my day's delight is past my horse is gone
and tis your fault i am bereft him so
i pray you hence and leave me here alone
for all my mind my thought my busy care
is how to get my palfrey from the mare'
thus she replies thy palfrey as he should
welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
affection is a coal that must be cool'd
else suffer'd it will set the heart on fire
the sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone
'how like a jade he stood tied to the tree
servilely master'd with a leathern rein
but when he saw his love his youth's fair fee
he held such petty bondage in disdain
throwing the base thong from his bending crest
enfranchising his mouth his back his breast
'who sees his truelove in her naked bed
teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
but when his glutton eye so full hath fed
his other agents aim at like delight
who is so faint that dare not be so bold
to touch the fire the weather being cold
'let me excuse thy courser gentle boy
and learn of him i heartily beseech thee
to take advantage on presented joy
though i were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
o learn to love the lesson is but plain
and once made perfect never lost again'
i know not love quoth he nor will not know it
unless it be a boar and then i chase it
'tis much to borrow and i will not owe it
my love to love is love but to disgrace it
for i have heard it is a life in death
that laughs and weeps and all but with a breath
'who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd
who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth
if springing things be any jot diminish'd
they wither in their prime prove nothing worth
the colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
loseth his pride and never waxeth strong
'you hurt my hand with wringing let us part
and leave this idle theme this bootless chat
remove your siege from my unyielding heart
to love's alarms it will not ope the gate
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery
for where a heart is hard they make no battery'
'what canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue
o would thou hadst not or i had no hearing
thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong
i had my load before now press'd with bearing
melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
ear's deepsweet music and heart's deepsore wounding
'had i no eyes but ears my ears would love
that inward beauty and invisible
or were i deaf thy outward parts would move
each part in me that were but sensible
though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see
yet should i be in love by touching thee
'say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
and that i could not see nor hear nor touch
and nothing but the very smell were left me
yet would my love to thee be still as much
for from the stillitory of thy face excelling
comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by
smelling
'but o what banquet wert thou to the taste
being nurse and feeder of the other four
would they not wish the feast might ever last
and bid suspicion doublelock the door
lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest
should by his stealing in disturb the feast'
once more the rubycolour'd portal open'd
which to his speech did honey passage yield
like a red morn that ever yet betoken'd
wreck to the seaman tempest to the field
sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds
gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds
this ill presage advisedly she marketh
even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth
or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
or as the berry breaks before it staineth
or like the deadly bullet of a gun
his meaning struck her ere his words begun
and at his look she flatly falleth down
for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth
a smile recures the wounding of a frown
but blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth
the silly boy believing she is dead
claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red
and all amazed brake off his late intent
for sharply he did think to reprehend her
which cunning love did wittily prevent
fair fall the wit that can so well defend her
for on the grass she lies as she were slain
till his breath breatheth life in her again
he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks
he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard
he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd
he kisses her and she by her good will
will never rise so he will kiss her still
the night of sorrow now is turn'd to day
her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth
like the fair sun when in his fresh array
he cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth
and as the bright sun glorifies the sky
so is her face illumined with her eye
whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd
as if from thence they borrow'd all their shine
were never four such lamps together mix'd
had not his clouded with his brow's repine
but hers which through the crystal tears gave light
shone like the moon in water seen by night
'o where am i quoth she in earth or heaven
or in the ocean drench'd or in the fire
what hour is this or morn or weary even
do i delight to die or life desire
but now i lived and life was death's annoy
but now i died and death was lively joy
'o thou didst kill me kill me once again
thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine
hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
that they have murder'd this poor heart of mine
and these mine eyes true leaders to their queen
but for thy piteous lips no more had seen
'long may they kiss each other for this cure
o never let their crimson liveries wear
and as they last their verdure still endure
to drive infection from the dangerous year
that the stargazers having writ on death
may say the plague is banish'd by thy breath
'pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
what bargains may i make still to be sealing
to sell myself i can be well contented
so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
which purchase if thou make for fear of slips
set thy sealmanual on my waxred lips
'a thousand kisses buys my heart from me
and pay them at thy leisure one by one
what is ten hundred touches unto thee
are they not quickly told and quickly gone
say for nonpayment that the debt should double
is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble
'fair queen quoth he if any love you owe me
measure my strangeness with my unripe years
before i know myself seek not to know me
no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
the mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast
or being early pluck'd is sour to taste
'look the world's comforter with weary gait
his day's hot task hath ended in the west
the owl night's herald shrieks 'tis very late'
the sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest
and coalblack clouds that shadow heaven's light
do summon us to part and bid good night
'now let me say good night and so say you
if you will say so you shall have a kiss'
'good night quoth she and ere he says adieu'
the honey fee of parting tender'd is
her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
incorporate then they seem face grows to face
till breathless he disjoin'd and backward drew
the heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth
whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth
he with her plenty press'd she faint with dearth
their lips together glued fall to the earth
now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
and gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth
her lips are conquerors his lips obey
paying what ransom the insulter willeth
whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
that she will draw his lips rich treasure dry
and having felt the sweetness of the spoil
with blindfold fury she begins to forage
her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil
and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage
planting oblivion beating reason back
forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack
hot faint and weary with her hard embracing
like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling
or as the fleetfoot roe that's tired with chasing
or like the froward infant still'd with dandling
he now obeys and now no more resisteth
while she takes all she can not all she listeth
what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering
and yields at last to every light impression
things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing
chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission
affection faints not like a palefaced coward
but then woos best when most his choice is froward
when he did frown o had she then gave over
such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd
foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
what though the rose have prickles yet tis pluck'd
were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
yet love breaks through and picks them all at last
for pity now she can no more detain him
the poor fool prays her that he may depart
she is resolved no longer to restrain him
bids him farewell and look well to her heart
the which by cupid's bow she doth protest
he carries thence incaged in his breast
'sweet boy she says this night i'll waste in sorrow
for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
tell me love's master shall we meet tomorrow
say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match'
he tells her no tomorrow he intends
to hunt the boar with certain of his friends
'the boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale
like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale
and on his neck her yoking arms she throws
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck
he on her belly falls she on her back
now is she in the very lists of love
her champion mounted for the hot encounter
all is imaginary she doth prove
he will not manage her although he mount her
that worse than tantalus is her annoy
to clip elysium and to lack her joy
even as poor birds deceived with painted grapes
do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
even so she languisheth in her mishaps
as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
the warm effects which she in him finds missing
she seeks to kindle with continual kissing
but all in vain good queen it will not be
she hath assay'd as much as may be proved
her pleading hath deserved a greater fee
she's love she loves and yet she is not loved
'fie fie he says you crush me let me go
you have no reason to withhold me so'
'thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this
but that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar
o be advised thou know'st not what it is
with javelin's point a churlish swine to gore
whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still
like to a mortal butcher bent to kill
'on his bowback he hath a battle set
of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes
his eyes like glowworms shine when he doth fret
his snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes
being moved he strikes whate'er is in his way
and whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay
'his brawny sides with hairy bristles arm'd
are better proof than thy spear's point can enter
his short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd
being ireful on the lion he will venture
the thorny brambles and embracing bushes
as fearful of him part through whom he rushes
'alas he nought esteems that face of thine
to which love's eyes pay tributary gazes
nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne
whose full perfection all the world amazes
but having thee at vantagewondrous dread
would root these beauties as he roots the mead
'o let him keep his loathsome cabin still
beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends
come not within his danger by thy will
they that thrive well take counsel of their friends
when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble
i fear'd thy fortune and my joints did tremble
'didst thou not mark my face was it not white
saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
grew i not faint and fell i not downright
within my bosom whereon thou dost lie
my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest
but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast
'for where love reigns disturbing jealousy
doth call himself affection's sentinel
gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
and in a peaceful hour doth cry kill kill'
distempering gentle love in his desire
as air and water do abate the fire
'this sour informer this batebreeding spy
this canker that eats up love's tender spring
this carrytale dissentious jealousy
that sometime true news sometime false doth bring
knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
that if i love thee i thy death should fear
'and more than so presenteth to mine eye
the picture of an angrychafing boar
under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
an image like thyself all stain'd with gore
whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
doth make them droop with grief and hang the head
'what should i do seeing thee so indeed
that tremble at the imagination
the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
and fear doth teach it divination
i prophesy thy death my living sorrow
if thou encounter with the boar tomorrow
'but if thou needs wilt hunt be ruled by me
uncouple at the timorous flying hare
or at the fox which lives by subtlety
or at the roe which no encounter dare
pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs
and on thy wellbreath'd horse keep with thy
hounds
'and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles
how he outruns the wind and with what care
he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
the many musets through the which he goes
are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes
'sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
and sometime where earthdelving conies keep
to stop the loud pursuers in their yell
and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear
'for there his smell with others being mingled
the hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
with much ado the cold fault cleanly out
then do they spend their mouths echo replies
as if another chase were in the skies
'by this poor wat far off upon a hill
stands on his hinder legs with listening ear
to harken if his foes pursue him still
anon their loud alarums he doth hear
and now his grief may be compared well
to one sore sick that hears the passingbell
'then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch
turn and return indenting with the way
each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch
each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
for misery is trodden on by many
and being low never relieved by any
'lie quietly and hear a little more
nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
to make thee hate the hunting of the boar
unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize
applying this to that and so to so
for love can comment upon every woe
'where did i leave no matter where quoth he
'leave me and then the story aptly ends
the night is spent why what of that quoth she
'i am quoth he expected of my friends
and now tis dark and going i shall fall'
'in night quoth she desire sees best of all
'but if thou fall o then imagine this
the earth in love with thee thy footing trips
and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
make modest dian cloudy and forlorn
lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn
'now of this dark night i perceive the reason
cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine
till forging nature be condemn'd of treason
for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine
wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite
to shame the sun by day and her by night
'and therefore hath she bribed the destinies
to cross the curious workmanship of nature
to mingle beauty with infirmities
and pure perfection with impure defeature
making it subject to the tyranny
of mad mischances and much misery
'as burning fevers agues pale and faint
lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood
the marroweating sickness whose attaint
disorder breeds by heating of the blood
surfeits imposthumes grief and damn'd despair
swear nature's death for framing thee so fair
'and not the least of all these maladies
but in one minute's fight brings beauty under
both favour savour hue and qualities
whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder
are on the sudden wasted thaw'd and done
as mountainsnow melts with the midday sun
'therefore despite of fruitless chastity
lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns
that on the earth would breed a scarcity
and barren dearth of daughters and of sons
be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
dries up his oil to lend the world his light
'what is thy body but a swallowing grave
seeming to bury that posterity
which by the rights of time thou needs must have
if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity
if so the world will hold thee in disdain
sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain
'so in thyself thyself art made away
a mischief worse than civil homebred strife
or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
or butchersire that reaves his son of life
foulcankering rust the hidden treasure frets
but gold that's put to use more gold begets'
'nay then quoth adon you will fall again
into your idle overhandled theme
the kiss i gave you is bestow'd in vain
and all in vain you strive against the stream
for by this blackfaced night desire's foul nurse
your treatise makes me like you worse and worse
'if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
and every tongue more moving than your own
bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs
yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
for know my heart stands armed in mine ear
and will not let a false sound enter there
'lest the deceiving harmony should run
into the quiet closure of my breast
and then my little heart were quite undone
in his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest
no lady no my heart longs not to groan
but soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone
'what have you urged that i cannot reprove
the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger
i hate not love but your device in love
that lends embracements unto every stranger
you do it for increase o strange excuse
when reason is the bawd to lust's abuse
'call it not love for love to heaven is fled
since sweating lust on earth usurp'd his name
under whose simple semblance he hath fed
upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame
which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
as caterpillars do the tender leaves
'love comforteth like sunshine after rain
but lust's effect is tempest after sun
love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain
lust's winter comes ere summer half be done
love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies
love is all truth lust full of forged lies
'more i could tell but more i dare not say
the text is old the orator too green
therefore in sadness now i will away
my face is full of shame my heart of teen
mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
do burn themselves for having so offended'
with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
and homeward through the dark laund runs apace
leaves love upon her back deeply distress'd
look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
so glides he in the night from venus eye
which after him she darts as one on shore
gazing upon a lateembarked friend
till the wild waves will have him seen no more
whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend
so did the merciless and pitchy night
fold in the object that did feed her sight
whereat amazed as one that unaware
hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood
or stonish'd as nightwanderers often are
their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
even so confounded in the dark she lay
having lost the fair discovery of her way
and now she beats her heart whereat it groans
that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled
make verbal repetition of her moans
passion on passion deeply is redoubled
'ay me she cries and twenty times woe woe'
and twenty echoes twenty times cry so
she marking them begins a wailing note
and sings extemporally a woeful ditty
how love makes young men thrall and old men dote
how love is wise in folly foolishwitty
her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
and still the choir of echoes answer so
her song was tedious and outwore the night
for lovers hours are long though seeming short
if pleased themselves others they think delight
in suchlike circumstance with suchlike sport
their copious stories oftentimes begun
end without audience and are never done
for who hath she to spend the night withal
but idle sounds resembling parasites
like shrilltongued tapsters answering every call
soothing the humour of fantastic wits
she says 'tis so they answer all 'tis so'
and would say after her if she said no'
lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
the sun ariseth in his majesty
who doth the world so gloriously behold
that cedartops and hills seem burnish'd gold
venus salutes him with this fair goodmorrow
'o thou clear god and patron of all light
from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
the beauteous influence that makes him bright
there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother
may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other'
this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove
musing the morning is so much o'erworn
and yet she hears no tidings of her love
she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn
anon she hears them chant it lustily
and all in haste she coasteth to the cry
and as she runs the bushes in the way
some catch her by the neck some kiss her face
some twine about her thigh to make her stay
she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake
by this she hears the hounds are at a bay
whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way
the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder
even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
appals her senses and her spirit confounds
for now she knows it is no gentle chase
but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud
because the cry remaineth in one place
where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
finding their enemy to be so curst
they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first
this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear
through which it enters to surprise her heart
who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
with coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part
like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
they basely fly and dare not stay the field
thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
till cheering up her senses all dismay'd
she tells them tis a causeless fantasy
and childish error that they are afraid
bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
and with that word she spied the hunted boar
whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red
like milk and blood being mingled both together
a second fear through all her sinews spread
which madly hurries her she knows not whither
this way runs and now she will no further
but back retires to rate the boar for murther
a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
she treads the path that she untreads again
her more than haste is mated with delays
like the proceedings of a drunken brain
full of respects yet nought at all respecting
in hand with all things nought at all effecting
here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound
and asks the weary caitiff for his master
and there another licking of his wound
'gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster
and here she meets another sadly scowling
to whom she speaks and he replies with howling
when he hath ceased his illresounding noise
another flapmouth'd mourner black and grim
against the welkin volleys out his voice
another and another answer him
clapping their proud tails to the ground below
shaking their scratch'd ears bleeding as they go
look how the world's poor people are amazed
at apparitions signs and prodigies
whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed
infusing them with dreadful prophecies
so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
and sighing it again exclaims on death
'hardfavour'd tyrant ugly meagre lean
hateful divorce of love'thus chides she death
'grimgrinning ghost earth's worm what dost thou mean
to stifle beauty and to steal his breath
who when he lived his breath and beauty set
gloss on the rose smell to the violet
'if he be deado no it cannot be
seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it
o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see
but hatefully at random dost thou hit
thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart
'hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
and hearing him thy power had lost his power
the destinies will curse thee for this stroke
they bid thee crop a weed thou pluck'st a flower
love's golden arrow at him should have fled
and not death's ebon dart to strike dead
'dost thou drink tears that thou provokest such weeping
what may a heavy groan advantage thee
why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
those eyes that taught all other eyes to see
now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour'
here overcome as one full of despair
she vail'd her eyelids who like sluices stopt
the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
in the sweet channel of her bosom dropt
but through the floodgates breaks the silver rain
and with his strong course opens them again
o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye
both crystals where they view'd each other's sorrow
sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry
but like a stormy day now wind now rain
sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again
variable passions throng her constant woe
as striving who should best become her grief
all entertain'd each passion labours so
that every present sorrow seemeth chief
but none is best then join they all together
like many clouds consulting for foul weather
by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
a nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well
the dire imagination she did follow
this sound of hope doth labour to expel
for now reviving joy bids her rejoice
and flatters her it is adonis voice
whereat her tears began to turn their tide
being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass
yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd
o hardbelieving love how strange it seems
not to believe and yet too credulous
thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
despair and hope makes thee ridiculous
the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly
now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
adonis lives and death is not to blame
it was not she that call'd him allto naught
now she adds honours to his hateful name
she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
imperious supreme of all mortal things
'no no quoth she sweet death i did but jest
yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
when as i met the boar that bloody beast
which knows no pity but is still severe
then gentle shadowtruth i must confess
i rail'd on thee fearing my love's decease
''tis not my fault the boar provoked my tongue
be wreak'd on him invisible commander
'tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong
i did but act he's author of thy slander
grief hath two tongues and never woman yet
could rule them both without ten women's wit'
thus hoping that adonis is alive
her rash suspect she doth extenuate
and that his beauty may the better thrive
with death she humbly doth insinuate
tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
his victories his triumphs and his glories
'o jove quoth she how much a fool was i
to be of such a weak and silly mind
to wail his death who lives and must not die
till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
for he being dead with him is beauty slain
and beauty dead black chaos comes again
'fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear
as one with treasure laden hemm'd thieves
trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves'
even at this word she hears a merry horn
whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn
as falcon to the lure away she flies
the grass stoops not she treads on it so light
and in her haste unfortunately spies
the foul boar's conquest on her fair delight
which seen her eyes as murder'd with the view
like stars ashamed of day themselves withdrew
or as the snail whose tender horns being hit
shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain
and there all smother'd up in shade doth sit
long after fearing to creep forth again
so at his bloody view her eyes are fled
into the deep dark cabins of her head
where they resign their office and their light
to the disposing of her troubled brain
who bids them still consort with ugly night
and never wound the heart with looks again
who like a king perplexed in his throne
by their suggestion gives a deadly groan
whereat each tributary subject quakes
as when the wind imprison'd in the ground
struggling for passage earth's foundation shakes
which with cold terror doth men's minds confound
this mutiny each part doth so surprise
that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes
and being open'd threw unwilling light
upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
in his soft flank whose wonted lily white
with purple tears that his wound wept was drench'd
no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
but stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed
this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth
over one shoulder doth she hang her head
dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
she thinks he could not die he is not dead
her voice is stopt her joints forget to bow
her eyes are mad that they have wept til now
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
and then she reprehends her mangling eye
that makes more gashes where no breach should be
his face seems twain each several limb is doubled
for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled
'my tongue cannot express my grief for one
and yet quoth she behold two adons dead
my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone
mine eyes are turn'd to fire my heart to lead
heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes red fire
so shall i die by drops of hot desire
'alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
what face remains alive that's worth the viewing
whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
of things long since or any thing ensuing
the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim
but truesweet beauty lived and died with him
'bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
having no fair to lose you need not fear
the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
but when adonis lived sun and sharp air
lurk'd like two thieves to rob him of his fair
'and therefore would he put his bonnet on
under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep
the wind would blow it off and being gone
play with his locks then would adonis weep
and straight in pity of his tender years
they both would strive who first should dry his tears
'to see his face the lion walk'd along
behind some hedge because he would not fear him
to recreate himself when he hath sung
the tiger would be tame and gently hear him
if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey
and never fright the silly lamb that day
'when he beheld his shadow in the brook
the fishes spread on it their golden gills
when he was by the birds such pleasure took
that some would sing some other in their bills
would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries
he fed them with his sight they him with berries
'but this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar
whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore
witness the entertainment that he gave
if he did see his face why then i know
he thought to kiss him and hath kill'd him so
''tis true tis true thus was adonis slain
he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear
who did not whet his teeth at him again
but by a kiss thought to persuade him there
and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin
'had i been tooth'd like him i must confess
with kissing him i should have kill'd him first
but he is dead and never did he bless
my youth with his the more am i accurst'
with this she falleth in the place she stood
and stains her face with his congealed blood
she looks upon his lips and they are pale
she takes him by the hand and that is cold
she whispers in his ears a heavy tale
as if they heard the woeful words she told
she lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes
where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies
two glasses where herself herself beheld
a thousand times and now no more reflect
their virtue lost wherein they late excell'd
and every beauty robb'd of his effect
'wonder of time quoth she this is my spite
that thou being dead the day should yet be light
'since thou art dead lo here i prophesy
sorrow on love hereafter shall attend
it shall be waited on with jealousy
find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
ne'er settled equally but high or low
that all love's pleasure shall not match his woe
'it shall be fickle false and full of fraud
bud and be blasted in a breathingwhile
the bottom poison and the top o'erstraw'd
with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile
the strongest body shall it make most weak
strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak
'it shall be sparing and too full of riot
teaching decrepit age to tread the measures
the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures
it shall be ragingmad and sillymild
make the young old the old become a child
'it shall suspect where is no cause of fear
it shall not fear where it should most mistrust
it shall be merciful and too severe
and most deceiving when it seems most just
perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
put fear to valour courage to the coward
'it shall be cause of war and dire events
and set dissension twixt the son and sire
subject and servile to all discontents
as dry combustious matter is to fire
sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
they that love best their loves shall not enjoy'
by this the boy that by her side lay kill'd
was melted like a vapour from her sight
and in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd
a purple flower sprung up chequer'd with white
resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
which in round drops upon their whiteness stood
she bows her head the newsprung flower to smell
comparing it to her adonis breath
and says within her bosom it shall dwell
since he himself is reft from her by death
she crops the stalk and in the breach appears
green dropping sap which she compares to tears
'poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise
sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire
for every little grief to wet his eyes
to grow unto himself was his desire
and so tis thine but know it is as good
to wither in my breast as in his blood
'here was thy father's bed here in my breast
thou art the next of blood and tis thy right
lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
there shall not be one minute in an hour
wherein i will not kiss my sweet love's flower'
thus weary of the world away she hies
and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through the empty skies
in her light chariot quickly is convey'd
holding their course to paphos where their queen
means to immure herself and not be seen
 all's well that ends well

lafeu you shall find of the king a husband madam you
 sir a father he that so generally is at all times
 good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose
 worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
 than lack it where there is such abundance
countess what hope is there of his majesty's amendment
lafeu he hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose
 practises he hath persecuted time with hope and
 finds no other advantage in the process but only the
 losing of hope by time
countess this young gentlewoman had a fathero that

 almost as great as his honesty had it stretched so
 far would have made nature immortal and death
 should have play for lack of work would for the
 king's sake he were living i think it would be

countess he was famous sir in his profession and it was
 his great right to be so gerard de narbon
lafeu he was excellent indeed madam the king very
 lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he
 was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge

lafeu i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman
 the daughter of gerard de narbon
countess his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my

 i am undone there is no living none
 if bertram be away twere all one
 that i should love a bright particular star
 and think to wed it he is so above me
 in his bright radiance and collateral light
 must i be comforted not in his sphere
 the ambition in my love thus plagues itself
 the hind that would be mated by the lion
 must die for love twas pretty though plague
 to see him every hour to sit and draw
 his arched brows his hawking eye his curls
 in our heart's table heart too capable
 of every line and trick of his sweet favour
 but now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy
 must sanctify his reliques who comes here
 enter parolles
 aside
 one that goes with him i love him for his sake
 and yet i know him a notorious liar

 cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
parolles save you fair queen
helena and you monarch
parolles no
helena and no
parolles are you meditating on virginity
helena ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me
 ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how
 may we barricado it against him
parolles keep him out
helena but he assails and our virginity though valiant
 in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some
 warlike resistance
parolles there is none man sitting down before you will
 undermine you and blow you up
helena bless our poor virginity from underminers and
 blowers up is there no military policy how
 virgins might blow up men
parolles virginity being blown down man will quicklier be
 blown up marry in blowing him down again with
 the breach yourselves made you lose your city it
 is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
 preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational
 increase and there was never virgin got till
 virginity was first lost that you were made of is
 metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost
 may be ten times found by being ever kept it is
 ever lost tis too cold a companion away with t
helena i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin
parolles there's little can be said in t tis against the
 rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity
 is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible
 disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin
 virginity murders itself and should be buried in
 highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
 offendress against nature virginity breeds mites
 much like a cheese consumes itself to the very
 paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach
 besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of

 your old virginity is like one of our french
 withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry

 marry yet tis a withered pear will you anything with it
helena not my virginity yet 
 there shall your master have a thousand loves
 a mother and a mistress and a friend
 a phoenix captain and an enemy
 a guide a goddess and a sovereign
 a counsellor a traitress and a dear
 his humble ambition proud humility
 his jarring concord and his discord dulcet
 his faith his sweet disaster with a world
 of pretty fond adoptious christendoms

 the court's a learning place and he is one
parolles what one i faith
helena that i wish well tis pity
parolles what's pity
helena that wishing well had not a body in't
 which might be felt that we the poorer born
 whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
 might with effects of them follow our friends
 and show what we alone must think which never
 return us thanks

helena when he was retrograde i think rather
parolles why think you so
helena you go so much backward when you fight
parolles that's for advantage
helena so is running away when fear proposes the safety
 but the composition that your valour and fear makes
 in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well
parolles i am so full of businesses i cannot answer thee
 acutely i will return perfect courtier in the

 thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
 counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
 thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and
 thine ignorance makes thee away farewell when
 thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast

helena our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
 which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky
 gives us free scope only doth backward pull
 our slow designs when we ourselves are dull

 to join like likes and kiss like native things

 flourish of cornets enter the king of france
 with letters and divers attendants
king the florentines and senoys are by the ears
 have fought with equal fortune and continue
 a braving war
first lord so tis reported sir
king nay tis most credible we here received it
 a certainty vouch'd from our cousin austria
 with caution that the florentine will move us
 for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
 prejudicates the business and would seem
 to have us make denial
first lord his love and wisdom
 approved so to your majesty may plead
 for amplest credence
king he hath arm'd our answer
 and florence is denied before he comes
 yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
 the tuscan service freely have they leave
 to stand on either part
second lord it well may serve

 for breathing and exploit
king what's he comes here

first lord it is the count rousillon my good lord
 young bertram
king youth thou bear'st thy father's face
 frank nature rather curious than in haste
 hath well composed thee thy father's moral parts
 mayst thou inherit too welcome to paris
bertram my thanks and duty are your majesty's
king i would i had that corporal soundness now
 as when thy father and myself in friendship
 first tried our soldiership he did look far
 into the service of the time and was
 discipled of the bravest he lasted long
 but on us both did haggish age steal on
 and wore us out of act it much repairs me
 to talk of your good father in his youth
 he had the wit which i can well observe
 today in our young lords but they may jest
 till their own scorn return to them unnoted
 ere they can hide their levity in honour
 so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
 were in his pride or sharpness if they were
 his equal had awaked them and his honour
 clock to itself knew the true minute when
 exception bid him speak and at this time
 his tongue obey'd his hand who were below him
 he used as creatures of another place
 and bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks
 making them proud of his humility
 in their poor praise he humbled such a man
 might be a copy to these younger times
 which follow'd well would demonstrate them now
 but goers backward
bertram his good remembrance sir
 lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
 so in approof lives not his epitaph
 as in your royal speech
king would i were with him he would always say
 methinks i hear him now his plausive words
 he scatter'd not in ears but grafted them
 to grow there and to bear'let me not live'
 this his good melancholy oft began
 on the catastrophe and heel of pastime
 when it was out'let me not live quoth he
 after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff
 of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
 all but new things disdain whose judgments are
 mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
 expire before their fashions this he wish'd
 i after him do after him wish too
 since i nor wax nor honey can bring home
 i quickly were dissolved from my hive
 to give some labourers room
second lord you are loved sir
 they that least lend it you shall lack you first
king i fill a place i know't how long is't count
 since the physician at your father's died
 he was much famed
bertram some six months since my lord
king if he were living i would try him yet

 such difference betwixt their two estates love no
 god that would not extend his might only where

 enter helena
 even so it was with me when i was young
 if ever we are nature's these are ours this thorn
 doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
 our blood to us this to our blood is born
 it is the show and seal of nature's truth
 where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth
 by our remembrances of days foregone
 such were our faults or then we thought them none
 her eye is sick on't i observe her now
helena what is your pleasure madam
countess you know helen
 i am a mother to you
helena mine honourable mistress
countess nay a mother
 why not a mother when i said a mother'
 methought you saw a serpent what's in mother'
 that you start at it i say i am your mother
 and put you in the catalogue of those
 that were enwombed mine tis often seen
 adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
 a native slip to us from foreign seeds
 you ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan
 yet i express to you a mother's care
 god's mercy maiden does it curd thy blood
 to say i am thy mother what's the matter
 that this distemper'd messenger of wet
 the manycolour'd iris rounds thine eye
 why that you are my daughter
helena that i am not
countess i say i am your mother
helena pardon madam
 the count rousillon cannot be my brother
 i am from humble he from honour'd name
 no note upon my parents his all noble
 my master my dear lord he is and i
 his servant live and will his vassal die
 he must not be my brother
countess nor i your mother
helena you are my mother madam would you were
 so that my lord your son were not my brother
 indeed my mother or were you both our mothers
 i care no more for than i do for heaven
 so i were not his sister can't no other
 but i your daughter he must be my brother
countess yes helen you might be my daughterinlaw
 god shield you mean it not daughter and mother
 so strive upon your pulse what pale again
 my fear hath catch'd your fondness now i see
 the mystery of your loneliness and find
 your salt tears head now to all sense tis gross
 you love my son invention is ashamed
 against the proclamation of thy passion
 to say thou dost not therefore tell me true
 but tell me then tis so for look thy cheeks

 see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
 that in their kind they speak it only sin
 and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
 that truth should be suspected speak is't so
 if it be so you have wound a goodly clew
 if it be not forswear't howe'er i charge thee
 as heaven shall work in me for thine avail
 tell me truly
helena good madam pardon me

countess go not about my love hath in't a bond
 whereof the world takes note come come disclose
 the state of your affection for your passions

helena then i confess
 here on my knee before high heaven and you
 that before you and next unto high heaven
 i love your son
 my friends were poor but honest so's my love
 be not offended for it hurts not him
 that he is loved of me i follow him not
 by any token of presumptuous suit
 nor would i have him till i do deserve him
 yet never know how that desert should be
 i know i love in vain strive against hope
 yet in this captious and intenible sieve
 i still pour in the waters of my love
 and lack not to lose still thus indianlike
 religious in mine error i adore
 the sun that looks upon his worshipper
 but knows of him no more my dearest madam
 let not your hate encounter with my love
 for loving where you do but if yourself
 whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
 did ever in so true a flame of liking
 wish chastely and love dearly that your dian
 was both herself and love o then give pity
 to her whose state is such that cannot choose
 but lend and give where she is sure to lose
 that seeks not to find that her search implies
 but riddlelike lives sweetly where she dies
countess had you not lately an intentspeak truly
 to go to paris
helena madam i had
countess wherefore tell true
helena i will tell truth by grace itself i swear
 you know my father left me some prescriptions
 of rare and proved effects such as his reading
 and manifest experience had collected
 for general sovereignty and that he will'd me
 in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them
 as notes whose faculties inclusive were
 more than they were in note amongst the rest
 there is a remedy approved set down
 to cure the desperate languishings whereof
 the king is render'd lost
countess this was your motive
 for paris was it speak
helena my lord your son made me to think of this
 else paris and the medicine and the king
 had from the conversation of my thoughts
 haply been absent then
countess but think you helen
 if you should tender your supposed aid
 he would receive it he and his physicians
 are of a mind he that they cannot help him
 they that they cannot help how shall they credit
 a poor unlearned virgin when the schools
 embowell'd of their doctrine have left off
 the danger to itself
helena there's something in't
 more than my father's skill which was the greatest
 of his profession that his good receipt
 shall for my legacy be sanctified
 by the luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
 but give me leave to try success i'ld venture
 the welllost life of mine on his grace's cure
 by such a day and hour
countess dost thou believe't
helena ay madam knowingly
countess why helen thou shalt have my leave and love
 means and attendants and my loving greetings
 to those of mine in court i'll stay at home
 and pray god's blessing into thy attempt
 be gone tomorrow and be sure of this
 what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss

king i'll fee thee to stand up
lafeu then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon
 i would you had kneel'd my lord to ask me mercy
 and that at my bidding you could so stand up
king i would i had so i had broke thy pate
 and ask'd thee mercy for't
lafeu good faith across but my good lord tis thus
 will you be cured of your infirmity
king no
lafeu o will you eat no grapes my royal fox
 yes but you will my noble grapes an if
 my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine
 that's able to breathe life into a stone
 quicken a rock and make you dance canary
 with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
 is powerful to araise king pepin nay
 to give great charlemain a pen in's hand
 and write to her a loveline
king what her is this
lafeu why doctor she my lord there's one arrived
 if you will see her now by my faith and honour
 if seriously i may convey my thoughts
 in this my light deliverance i have spoke
 with one that in her sex her years profession
 wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more
 than i dare blame my weakness will you see her
 for that is her demand and know her business
 that done laugh well at me
king now good lafeu
 bring in the admiration that we with thee
 may spend our wonder too or take off thine
 by wondering how thou took'st it
lafeu nay i'll fit you
 and not be all day neither

king thus he his special nothing ever prologues
 reenter lafeu with helena
lafeu nay come your ways

 his majesty seldom fears i am cressid's uncle
 that dare leave two together fare you well
 exit
king now fair one does your business follow us
helena ay my good lord
 gerard de narbon was my father
 in what he did profess well found
king i knew him
helena the rather will i spare my praises towards him
 knowing him is enough on's bed of death
 many receipts he gave me chiefly one
 which as the dearest issue of his practise
 and of his old experience the oily darling
 he bade me store up as a triple eye
 safer than mine own two more dear i have so
 and hearing your high majesty is touch'd
 with that malignant cause wherein the honour
 of my dear father's gift stands chief in power
 i come to tender it and my appliance
 with all bound humbleness
king we thank you maiden
 but may not be so credulous of cure
 when our most learned doctors leave us and
 the congregated college have concluded
 that labouring art can never ransom nature
 from her inaidible estate i say we must not
 so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
 to prostitute our pastcure malady
 to empirics or to dissever so
 our great self and our credit to esteem
 a senseless help when help past sense we deem
helena my duty then shall pay me for my pains
 i will no more enforce mine office on you
 humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
 a modest one to bear me back a again
king i cannot give thee less to be call'd grateful
 thou thought'st to help me and such thanks i give
 as one near death to those that wish him live
 but what at full i know thou know'st no part
 i knowing all my peril thou no art
helena what i can do can do no hurt to try
 since you set up your rest gainst remedy
 he that of greatest works is finisher
 oft does them by the weakest minister
 so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
 when judges have been babes great floods have flown
 from simple sources and great seas have dried
 when miracles have by the greatest been denied
 oft expectation fails and most oft there
 where most it promises and oft it hits
 where hope is coldest and despair most fits
king i must not hear thee fare thee well kind maid
 thy pains not used must by thyself be paid
 proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
helena inspired merit so by breath is barr'd
 it is not so with him that all things knows
 as tis with us that square our guess by shows
 but most it is presumption in us when
 the help of heaven we count the act of men
 dear sir to my endeavours give consent
 of heaven not me make an experiment
 i am not an impostor that proclaim
 myself against the level of mine aim
 but know i think and think i know most sure
 my art is not past power nor you past cure
king are thou so confident within what space
 hopest thou my cure
helena the great'st grace lending grace
 ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
 their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
 ere twice in murk and occidental damp
 moist hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp
 or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
 hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
 what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
 health shall live free and sickness freely die
king upon thy certainty and confidence
 what darest thou venture
helena tax of impudence
 a strumpet's boldness a divulged shame
 traduced by odious ballads my maiden's name
 sear'd otherwise nay worseif worseextended
 with vilest torture let my life be ended
king methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
 his powerful sound within an organ weak
 and what impossibility would slay
 in common sense sense saves another way
 thy life is dear for all that life can rate
 worth name of life in thee hath estimate
 youth beauty wisdom courage all
 that happiness and prime can happy call
 thou this to hazard needs must intimate
 skill infinite or monstrous desperate
 sweet practiser thy physic i will try
 that ministers thine own death if i die
helena if i break time or flinch in property
 of what i spoke unpitied let me die
 and well deserved not helping death's my fee
 but if i help what do you promise me
king make thy demand
helena but will you make it even
king ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
helena then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
 what husband in thy power i will command
 exempted be from me the arrogance
 to choose from forth the royal blood of france
 my low and humble name to propagate
 with any branch or image of thy state
 but such a one thy vassal whom i know
 is free for me to ask thee to bestow
king here is my hand the premises observed
 thy will by my performance shall be served
 so make the choice of thy own time for i
 thy resolved patient on thee still rely
 more should i question thee and more i must
 though more to know could not be more to trust
 from whence thou camest how tended on but rest
 unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest
 give me some help here ho if thou proceed
 as high as word my deed shall match thy meed

 questions
clown it is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks

 buttock or any buttock
countess will your answer serve fit to all questions
clown as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney
 as your french crown for your taffeta punk as tib's
 rush for tom's forefinger as a pancake for shrove
 tuesday a morris for mayday as the nail to his
 hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding queen
 to a wrangling knave as the nun's lip to the
 friar's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin
countess have you i say an answer of such fitness for all
 questions
clown from below your duke to beneath your constable it
 will fit any question
countess it must be an answer of most monstrous size that
 must fit all demands
clown but a trifle neither in good faith if the learned
 should speak truth of it here it is and all that
 belongs to't ask me if i am a courtier it shall
 do you no harm to learn
countess to be young again if we could i will be a fool in
 question hoping to be the wiser by your answer i
 pray you sir are you a courtier
clown o lord sir there's a simple putting off more
 more a hundred of them
countess sir i am a poor friend of yours that loves you
clown o lord sir thick thick spare not me
countess i think sir you can eat none of this homely meat
clown o lord sir nay put me to't i warrant you
countess you were lately whipped sir as i think
clown o lord sir spare not me
countess do you cry o lord sir at your whipping and
 spare not me indeed your o lord sir is very
 sequent to your whipping you would answer very well
 to a whipping if you were but bound to't
clown i ne'er had worse luck in my life in my o lord
 sir i see things may serve long but not serve ever
countess i play the noble housewife with the time
 to entertain't so merrily with a fool
clown o lord sir why there't serves well again
countess an end sir to your business give helen this
 and urge her to a present answer back
 commend me to my kinsmen and my son
 this is not much
clown not much commendation to them
countess not much employment for you you understand me

lafeu not to be helped
parolles right as twere a man assured of a
lafeu uncertain life and sure death
parolles just you say well so would i have said
lafeu i may truly say it is a novelty to the world
parolles it is indeed if you will have it in showing you

lafeu a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor
parolles that's it i would have said the very same
lafeu why your dolphin is not lustier fore me
 i speak in respect
parolles nay tis strange tis very strange that is the
 brief and the tedious of it and he's of a most
 facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the
lafeu very hand of heaven
parolles ay so i say
lafeu in a most weak
 pausing
 and debile minister great power great
 transcendence which should indeed give us a
 further use to be made than alone the recovery of
 the king as to be
 pausing
 generally thankful
parolles i would have said it you say well here comes the king
 enter king helena and attendants lafeu and
 parolles retire
lafeu lustig as the dutchman says i'll like a maid the
 better whilst i have a tooth in my head why he's
 able to lead her a coranto
parolles mort du vinaigre is not this helen
lafeu fore god i think so
king go call before me all the lords in court
 sit my preserver by thy patient's side
 and with this healthful hand whose banish'd sense
 thou hast repeal'd a second time receive
 the confirmation of my promised gift
 which but attends thy naming
 enter three or four lords
 fair maid send forth thine eye this youthful parcel
 of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing
 o'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
 i have to use thy frank election make
 thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
helena to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
 fall when love please marry to each but one
lafeu i'ld give bay curtal and his furniture
 my mouth no more were broken than these boys'
 and writ as little beard
king peruse them well
 not one of those but had a noble father
helena gentlemen
 heaven hath through me restored the king to health
all we understand it and thank heaven for you
helena i am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
 that i protest i simply am a maid
 please it your majesty i have done already
 the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
 we blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused
 let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
 we'll ne'er come there again'
king make choice and see
 who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
helena now dian from thy altar do i fly
 and to imperial love that god most high
 do my sighs stream sir will you hear my suit
first lord and grant it
helena thanks sir all the rest is mute
lafeu i had rather be in this choice than throw amesace
 for my life
helena the honour sir that flames in your fair eyes
 before i speak too threateningly replies
 love make your fortunes twenty times above
 her that so wishes and her humble love
second lord no better if you please
helena my wish receive
 which great love grant and so i take my leave
lafeu do all they deny her an they were sons of mine
 i'd have them whipped or i would send them to the
 turk to make eunuchs of
helena be not afraid that i your hand should take
 i'll never do you wrong for your own sake
 blessing upon your vows and in your bed
 find fairer fortune if you ever wed
lafeu these boys are boys of ice they'll none have her
 sure they are bastards to the english the french
 ne'er got em
helena you are too young too happy and too good
 to make yourself a son out of my blood
fourth lord fair one i think not so
lafeu there's one grape yet i am sure thy father drunk
 wine but if thou be'st not an ass i am a youth
 of fourteen i have known thee already
helena to bertram i dare not say i take you but i give
 me and my service ever whilst i live
 into your guiding power this is the man
king why then young bertram take her she's thy wife
bertram my wife my liege i shall beseech your highness
 in such a business give me leave to use
 the help of mine own eyes
king know'st thou not bertram
 what she has done for me
bertram yes my good lord
 but never hope to know why i should marry her
king thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed
bertram but follows it my lord to bring me down
 must answer for your raising i know her well
 she had her breeding at my father's charge
 a poor physician's daughter my wife disdain
 rather corrupt me ever
king tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which
 i can build up strange is it that our bloods
 of colour weight and heat pour'd all together
 would quite confound distinction yet stand off
 in differences so mighty if she be
 all that is virtuous save what thou dislikest
 a poor physician's daughter thou dislikest
 of virtue for the name but do not so
 from lowest place when virtuous things proceed
 the place is dignified by the doer's deed
 where great additions swell's and virtue none
 it is a dropsied honour good alone
 is good without a name vileness is so
 the property by what it is should go
 not by the title she is young wise fair
 in these to nature she's immediate heir
 and these breed honour that is honour's scorn
 which challenges itself as honour's born
 and is not like the sire honours thrive
 when rather from our acts we them derive
 than our foregoers the mere word's a slave
 debosh'd on every tomb on every grave
 a lying trophy and as oft is dumb
 where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
 of honour'd bones indeed what should be said
 if thou canst like this creature as a maid
 i can create the rest virtue and she
 is her own dower honour and wealth from me
bertram i cannot love her nor will strive to do't
king thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
helena that you are well restored my lord i'm glad
 let the rest go
king my honour's at the stake which to defeat
 i must produce my power here take her hand
 proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
 that dost in vile misprision shackle up
 my love and her desert that canst not dream
 we poising us in her defective scale
 shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
 it is in us to plant thine honour where
 we please to have it grow cheque thy contempt
 obey our will which travails in thy good
 believe not thy disdain but presently
 do thine own fortunes that obedient right
 which both thy duty owes and our power claims
 or i will throw thee from my care for ever
 into the staggers and the careless lapse
 of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
 loosing upon thee in the name of justice
 without all terms of pity speak thine answer
bertram pardon my gracious lord for i submit
 my fancy to your eyes when i consider
 what great creation and what dole of honour
 flies where you bid it i find that she which late
 was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
 the praised of the king who so ennobled
 is as twere born so
king take her by the hand
 and tell her she is thine to whom i promise
 a counterpoise if not to thy estate
 a balance more replete
bertram i take her hand
king good fortune and the favour of the king
 smile upon this contract whose ceremony
 shall seem expedient on the nowborn brief
 and be perform'd tonight the solemn feast
 shall more attend upon the coming space
 expecting absent friends as thou lovest her
 thy love's to me religious else does err

helena ay madam
first gentleman tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his
 heart was not consenting to
countess nothing in france until he have no wife
 there's nothing here that is too good for him

 that twenty such rude boys might tend upon
 and call her hourly mistress who was with him
first gentleman a servant only and a gentleman
 which i have sometime known
countess parolles was it not
first gentleman ay my good lady he
countess a very tainted fellow and full of wickedness

 whoever shoots at him i set him there
 whoever charges on his forward breast
 i am the caitiff that do hold him to't

 were mine at once no come thou home rousillon
 whence honour but of danger wins a scar
 as oft it loses all i will be gone

 with sainted vow my faults to have amended
 write write that from the bloody course of war
 my dearest master your dear son may hie
 bless him at home in peace whilst i from far
 his name with zealous fervor sanctify
 his taken labours bid him me forgive
 i his despiteful juno sent him forth
 from courtly friends with camping foes to live
 where death and danger dogs the heels of worth
 he is too good and fair for death and me
 whom i myself embrace to set him free
countess ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words
 rinaldo you did never lack advice so much
 as letting her pass so had i spoke with her
 i could have well diverted her intents
 which thus she hath prevented
steward pardon me madam
 if i had given you this at overnight
 she might have been o'erta'en and yet she writes
 pursuit would be but vain
countess what angel shall
 bless this unworthy husband he cannot thrive
 unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear
 and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath
 of greatest justice write write rinaldo
 to this unworthy husband of his wife
 let every word weigh heavy of her worth
 that he does weigh too light my greatest grief
 though little he do feel it set down sharply
 dispatch the most convenient messenger
 when haply he shall hear that she is gone
 he will return and hope i may that she
 hearing so much will speed her foot again
 led hither by pure love which of them both
 is dearest to me i have no skill in sense
 to make distinction provide this messenger

 a shrewd turn if she pleased

act iii
scene vi camp before florence
 enter bertram and the two french lords
second lord nay good my lord put him to't let him have his
 way
first lord if your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no
 more in your respect
second lord on my life my lord a bubble
bertram do you think i am so far deceived in him
second lord believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
 without any malice but to speak of him as my
 kinsman he's a most notable coward an infinite and
 endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner
 of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
 entertainment
first lord it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in
 his virtue which he hath not he might at some
 great and trusty business in a main danger fail you
bertram i would i knew in what particular action to try him
first lord none better than to let him fetch off his drum
 which you hear him so confidently undertake to do
second lord i with a troop of florentines will suddenly
 surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he
 knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink
 him so that he shall suppose no other but that he
 is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
 we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship
 present at his examination if he do not for the
 promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
 base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the
 intelligence in his power against you and that with
 the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never
 trust my judgment in any thing
first lord o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum
 he says he has a stratagem for't when your
 lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to
 what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
 melted if you give him not john drum's
 entertainment your inclining cannot be removed
 here he comes
 enter parolles
second lord aside to bertram o for the love of laughter
 hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch
 off his drum in any hand
bertram how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your
 disposition
first lord a pox on't let it go tis but a drum
parolles but a drum is't but a drum a drum so lost
 there was excellent commandto charge in with our
 horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers
first lord that was not to be blamed in the command of the
 service it was a disaster of war that caesar
 himself could not have prevented if he had been
 there to command
bertram well we cannot greatly condemn our success some
 dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is
 not to be recovered
parolles it might have been recovered
bertram it might but it is not now
parolles it is to be recovered but that the merit of
 service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
 performer i would have that drum or another or
 hic jacet'
bertram why if you have a stomach to't monsieur if you
 think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
 instrument of honour again into his native quarter
 be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will
 grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you
 speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it
 and extend to you what further becomes his
 greatness even to the utmost syllable of your
 worthiness
parolles by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it
bertram but you must not now slumber in it
parolles i'll about it this evening and i will presently
 pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my
 certainty put myself into my mortal preparation
 and by midnight look to hear further from me
bertram may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it
parolles i know not what the success will be my lord but
 the attempt i vow
bertram i know thou'rt valiant and to the possibility of
 thy soldiership will subscribe for thee farewell
parolles i love not many words
 exit
second lord no more than a fish loves water is not this a
 strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems
 to undertake this business which he knows is not to
 be done damns himself to do and dares better be
 damned than to do't
first lord you do not know him my lord as we do certain it
 is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
 for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but
 when you find him out you have him ever after
bertram why do you think he will make no deed at all of
 this that so seriously he does address himself unto
second lord none in the world but return with an invention and
 clap upon you two or three probable lies but we
 have almost embossed him you shall see his fall
 tonight for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect
first lord we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
 him he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu
 when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a
 sprat you shall find him which you shall see this
 very night
second lord i must go look my twigs he shall be caught
bertram your brother he shall go along with me
second lord as't please your lordship i'll leave you
 exit
bertram now will i lead you to the house and show you
 the lass i spoke of
first lord but you say she's honest
bertram that's all the fault i spoke with her but once
 and found her wondrous cold but i sent to her
 by this same coxcomb that we have i the wind
 tokens and letters which she did resend
 and this is all i have done she's a fair creature
 will you go see her
first lord with all my heart my lord
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well
act iii
scene vii florence the widow's house
 enter helena and widow
helena if you misdoubt me that i am not she
 i know not how i shall assure you further
 but i shall lose the grounds i work upon
widow though my estate be fallen i was well born
 nothing acquainted with these businesses
 and would not put my reputation now
 in any staining act
helena nor would i wish you
 first give me trust the count he is my husband
 and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken
 is so from word to word and then you cannot
 by the good aid that i of you shall borrow
 err in bestowing it
widow i should believe you
 for you have show'd me that which well approves
 you're great in fortune
helena take this purse of gold
 and let me buy your friendly help thus far
 which i will overpay and pay again
 when i have found it the count he wooes your daughter
 lays down his wanton siege before her beauty
 resolved to carry her let her in fine consent
 as we'll direct her how tis best to bear it
 now his important blood will nought deny
 that she'll demand a ring the county wears
 that downward hath succeeded in his house
 from son to son some four or five descents
 since the first father wore it this ring he holds
 in most rich choice yet in his idle fire
 to buy his will it would not seem too dear
 howe'er repented after
widow now i see
 the bottom of your purpose
helena you see it lawful then it is no more
 but that your daughter ere she seems as won
 desires this ring appoints him an encounter
 in fine delivers me to fill the time
 herself most chastely absent after this
 to marry her i'll add three thousand crowns
 to what is passed already
widow i have yielded
 instruct my daughter how she shall persever
 that time and place with this deceit so lawful
 may prove coherent every night he comes
 with musics of all sorts and songs composed
 to her unworthiness it nothing steads us
 to chide him from our eaves for he persists
 as if his life lay on't
helena why then tonight
 let us assay our plot which if it speed
 is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
 and lawful meaning in a lawful act
 where both not sin and yet a sinful fact
 but let's about it
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well
act iv
scene i without the florentine camp
 enter second french lord with five or six other
 soldiers in ambush
second lord he can come no other way but by this hedgecorner
 when you sally upon him speak what terrible
 language you will though you understand it not
 yourselves no matter for we must not seem to
 understand him unless some one among us whom we
 must produce for an interpreter
first soldier good captain let me be the interpreter
second lord art not acquainted with him knows he not thy voice
first soldier no sir i warrant you
second lord but what linseywoolsey hast thou to speak to us again
first soldier e'en such as you speak to me
second lord he must think us some band of strangers i the
 adversary's entertainment now he hath a smack of
 all neighbouring languages therefore we must every
 one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we
 speak one to another so we seem to know is to
 know straight our purpose choughs language
 gabble enough and good enough as for you
 interpreter you must seem very politic but couch
 ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep
 and then to return and swear the lies he forges
 enter parolles
parolles ten o'clock within these three hours twill be
 time enough to go home what shall i say i have
 done it must be a very plausive invention that
 carries it they begin to smoke me and disgraces
 have of late knocked too often at my door i find
 my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the
 fear of mars before it and of his creatures not
 daring the reports of my tongue
second lord this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
 was guilty of
parolles what the devil should move me to undertake the
 recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the
 impossibility and knowing i had no such purpose i
 must give myself some hurts and say i got them in
 exploit yet slight ones will not carry it they
 will say came you off with so little and great
 ones i dare not give wherefore what's the
 instance tongue i must put you into a
 butterwoman's mouth and buy myself another of
 bajazet's mule if you prattle me into these perils
second lord is it possible he should know what he is and be
 that he is
parolles i would the cutting of my garments would serve the
 turn or the breaking of my spanish sword
second lord we cannot afford you so
parolles or the baring of my beard and to say it was in
 stratagem
second lord twould not do
parolles or to drown my clothes and say i was stripped
second lord hardly serve
parolles though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel
second lord how deep
parolles thirty fathom
second lord three great oaths would scarce make that be believed
parolles i would i had any drum of the enemy's i would swear
 i recovered it
second lord you shall hear one anon
parolles a drum now of the enemy's
 alarum within
second lord throca movousus cargo cargo cargo

 and hoodwink'd as thou art will lead thee on
 to gather from thee haply thou mayst inform
 something to save thy life
parolles o let me live
 and all the secrets of our camp i'll show
 their force their purposes nay i'll speak that
 which you will wonder at
first soldier but wilt thou faithfully

 all's well that ends well
act iv
scene ii florence the widow's house
 enter bertram and diana
bertram they told me that your name was fontibell
diana no my good lord diana
bertram titled goddess
 and worth it with addition but fair soul
 in your fine frame hath love no quality
 if quick fire of youth light not your mind
 you are no maiden but a monument
 when you are dead you should be such a one
 as you are now for you are cold and stem
 and now you should be as your mother was
 when your sweet self was got
diana she then was honest
bertram so should you be
diana no
 my mother did but duty such my lord
 as you owe to your wife
bertram no more o that
 i prithee do not strive against my vows
 i was compell'd to her but i love thee
 by love's own sweet constraint and will for ever
 do thee all rights of service
diana ay so you serve us
 till we serve you but when you have our roses
 you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
 and mock us with our bareness
bertram how have i sworn
diana tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
 but the plain single vow that is vow'd true
 what is not holy that we swear not by
 but take the high'st to witness then pray you tell me
 if i should swear by god's great attributes
 i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths
 when i did love you ill this has no holding
 to swear by him whom i protest to love
 that i will work against him therefore your oaths
 are words and poor conditions but unseal'd
 at least in my opinion
bertram change it change it
 be not so holycruel love is holy
 and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
 that you do charge men with stand no more off
 but give thyself unto my sick desires
 who then recover say thou art mine and ever
 my love as it begins shall so persever
diana i see that men make ropes in such a scarre
 that we'll forsake ourselves give me that ring
bertram i'll lend it thee my dear but have no power
 to give it from me
diana will you not my lord
bertram it is an honour longing to our house
 bequeathed down from many ancestors
 which were the greatest obloquy i the world
 in me to lose
diana mine honour's such a ring
 my chastity's the jewel of our house
 bequeathed down from many ancestors
 which were the greatest obloquy i the world
 in me to lose thus your own proper wisdom
 brings in the champion honour on my part
 against your vain assault
bertram here take my ring
 my house mine honour yea my life be thine
 and i'll be bid by thee
diana when midnight comes knock at my chamberwindow
 i'll order take my mother shall not hear
 now will i charge you in the band of truth
 when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed
 remain there but an hour nor speak to me
 my reasons are most strong and you shall know them
 when back again this ring shall be deliver'd
 and on your finger in the night i'll put
 another ring that what in time proceeds
 may token to the future our past deeds
 adieu till then then fail not you have won
 a wife of me though there my hope be done
bertram a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee
 exit
diana for which live long to thank both heaven and me
 you may so in the end
 my mother told me just how he would woo
 as if she sat in s heart she says all men
 have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me
 when his wife's dead therefore i'll lie with him
 when i am buried since frenchmen are so braid
 marry that will i live and die a maid
 only in this disguise i think't no sin
 to cozen him that would unjustly win
 exit
 all's well that ends well
act iv
scene iii the florentine camp
 enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers
first lord you have not given him his mother's letter
second lord i have delivered it an hour since there is
 something in't that stings his nature for on the
 reading it he changed almost into another man
first lord he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
 off so good a wife and so sweet a lady
second lord especially he hath incurred the everlasting
 displeasure of the king who had even tuned his
 bounty to sing happiness to him i will tell you a
 thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you
first lord when you have spoken it tis dead and i am the
 grave of it
second lord he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
 florence of a most chaste renown and this night he
 fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath
 given her his monumental ring and thinks himself
 made in the unchaste composition
first lord now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves
 what things are we
second lord merely our own traitors and as in the common course
 of all treasons we still see them reveal
 themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends
 so he that in this action contrives against his own
 nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself
first lord is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of
 our unlawful intents we shall not then have his
 company tonight
second lord not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
first lord that approaches apace i would gladly have him see
 his company anatomized that he might take a measure
 of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had
 set this counterfeit
second lord we will not meddle with him till he come for his
 presence must be the whip of the other
first lord in the mean time what hear you of these wars
second lord i hear there is an overture of peace
first lord nay i assure you a peace concluded
second lord what will count rousillon do then will he travel
 higher or return again into france
first lord i perceive by this demand you are not altogether
 of his council
second lord let it be forbid sir so should i be a great deal
 of his act
first lord sir his wife some two months since fled from his
 house her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques
 le grand which holy undertaking with most austere
 sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the
 tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
 grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and
 now she sings in heaven
second lord how is this justified
first lord the stronger part of it by her own letters which
 makes her story true even to the point of her
 death her death itself which could not be her
 office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by
 the rector of the place
second lord hath the count all this intelligence
first lord ay and the particular confirmations point from
 point so to the full arming of the verity
second lord i am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this
first lord how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses
second lord and how mightily some other times we drown our gain
 in tears the great dignity that his valour hath
 here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
 with a shame as ample
first lord the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and
 ill together our virtues would be proud if our
 faults whipped them not and our crimes would
 despair if they were not cherished by our virtues
 enter a messenger
 how now where's your master
servant he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath
 taken a solemn leave his lordship will next
 morning for france the duke hath offered him
 letters of commendations to the king
second lord they shall be no more than needful there if they
 were more than they can commend
first lord they cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness
 here's his lordship now
 enter bertram
 how now my lord is't not after midnight
bertram i have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses a
 month's length apiece by an abstract of success
 i have congied with the duke done my adieu with his
 nearest buried a wife mourned for her writ to my
 lady mother i am returning entertained my convoy
 and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
 many nicer needs the last was the greatest but
 that i have not ended yet
second lord if the business be of any difficulty and this
 morning your departure hence it requires haste of
 your lordship
bertram i mean the business is not ended as fearing to
 hear of it hereafter but shall we have this
 dialogue between the fool and the soldier come
 bring forth this counterfeit module he has deceived
 me like a doublemeaning prophesier
second lord bring him forth has sat i the stocks all night
 poor gallant knave
bertram no matter his heels have deserved it in usurping
 his spurs so long how does he carry himself
second lord i have told your lordship already the stocks carry
 him but to answer you as you would be understood
 he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he
 hath confessed himself to morgan whom he supposes
 to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to
 this very instant disaster of his setting i the
 stocks and what think you he hath confessed
bertram nothing of me has a'
second lord his confession is taken and it shall be read to his
 face if your lordship be in't as i believe you
 are you must have the patience to hear it
 enter parolles guarded and first soldier
bertram a plague upon him muffled he can say nothing of
 me hush hush
first lord hoodman comes portotartarosa
first soldier he calls for the tortures what will you say
 without em
parolles i will confess what i know without constraint if
 ye pinch me like a pasty i can say no more
first soldier bosko chimurcho

first soldier you are a merciful general our general bids you
 answer to what i shall ask you out of a note
parolles and truly as i hope to live
first soldier reads first demand of him how many horse the
 duke is strong what say you to that
parolles five or six thousand but very weak and
 unserviceable the troops are all scattered and
 the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation
 and credit and as i hope to live
first soldier shall i set down your answer so
parolles do i'll take the sacrament on't how and which way you will
bertram all's one to him what a pastsaving slave is this
first lord you're deceived my lord this is monsieur
 parolles the gallant militaristthat was his own
 phrasethat had the whole theoric of war in the
 knot of his scarf and the practise in the chape of
 his dagger
second lord i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
 clean nor believe he can have every thing in him
 by wearing his apparel neatly
first soldier well that's set down
parolles five or six thousand horse i said i will say
 trueor thereabouts set down for i'll speak truth
first lord he's very near the truth in this
bertram but i con him no thanks for't in the nature he
 delivers it
parolles poor rogues i pray you say
first soldier well that's set down
parolles i humbly thank you sir a truth's a truth the
 rogues are marvellous poor
first soldier reads demand of him of what strength they are
 afoot what say you to that
parolles by my troth sir if i were to live this present
 hour i will tell true let me see spurio a
 hundred and fifty sebastian so many corambus so
 many jaques so many guiltian cosmo lodowick
 and gratii two hundred and fifty each mine own
 company chitopher vaumond bentii two hundred and
 fifty each so that the musterfile rotten and
 sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand
 poll half of the which dare not shake snow from off
 their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces
bertram what shall be done to him
first lord nothing but let him have thanks demand of him my
 condition and what credit i have with the duke
first soldier well that's set down
 reads
 you shall demand of him whether one captain dumain
 be i the camp a frenchman what his reputation is
 with the duke what his valour honesty and
 expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not
 possible with wellweighing sums of gold to
 corrupt him to revolt what say you to this what
 do you know of it
parolles i beseech you let me answer to the particular of
 the inter'gatories demand them singly
first soldier do you know this captain dumain
parolles i know him a was a botcher's prentice in paris
 from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
 fool with childa dumb innocent that could not
 say him nay
bertram nay by your leave hold your hands though i know
 his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls
first soldier well is this captain in the duke of florence's camp
parolles upon my knowledge he is and lousy
first lord nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your
 lordship anon
first soldier what is his reputation with the duke
parolles the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
 of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him
 out o the band i think i have his letter in my pocket
first soldier marry we'll search
parolles in good sadness i do not know either it is there
 or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
 in my tent
first soldier here tis here's a paper shall i read it to you
parolles i do not know if it be it or no
bertram our interpreter does it well
first lord excellently
first soldier reads dian the count's a fool and full of gold'
parolles that is not the duke's letter sir that is an
 advertisement to a proper maid in florence one
 diana to take heed of the allurement of one count
 rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very
 ruttish i pray you sir put it up again
first soldier nay i'll read it first by your favour
parolles my meaning in't i protest was very honest in the
 behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be
 a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to
 virginity and devours up all the fry it finds
bertram damnable bothsides rogue
first soldier reads when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it
 after he scores he never pays the score
 half won is match well made match and well make it
 he ne'er pays afterdebts take it before
 and say a soldier dian told thee this
 men are to mell with boys are not to kiss
 for count of this the count's a fool i know it
 who pays before but not when he does owe it
 thine as he vowed to thee in thine ear
 parolles'
bertram he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
 in's forehead
second lord this is your devoted friend sir the manifold
 linguist and the armipotent soldier
bertram i could endure any thing before but a cat and now
 he's a cat to me
first soldier i perceive sir by the general's looks we shall be
 fain to hang you
parolles my life sir in any case not that i am afraid to
 die but that my offences being many i would
 repent out the remainder of nature let me live
 sir in a dungeon i the stocks or any where so i may live
first soldier we'll see what may be done so you confess freely
 therefore once more to this captain dumain you
 have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
 his valour what is his honesty
parolles he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for
 rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he
 professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he
 is stronger than hercules he will lie sir with
 such volubility that you would think truth were a
 fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will
 be swinedrunk and in his sleep he does little
 harm save to his bedclothes about him but they
 know his conditions and lay him in straw i have but
 little more to say sir of his honesty he has
 every thing that an honest man should not have what
 an honest man should have he has nothing
first lord i begin to love him for this
bertram for this description of thine honesty a pox upon
 him for me he's more and more a cat
first soldier what say you to his expertness in war
parolles faith sir he has led the drum before the english
 tragedians to belie him i will not and more of
 his soldiership i know not except in that country
 he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
 called mileend to instruct for the doubling of
 files i would do the man what honour i can but of
 this i am not certain
first lord he hath outvillained villany so far that the
 rarity redeems him
bertram a pox on him he's a cat still
first soldier his qualities being at this poor price i need not
 to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
parolles sir for a quart d'ecu he will sell the feesimple
 of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the
 entail from all remainders and a perpetual
 succession for it perpetually
first soldier what's his brother the other captain dumain
second lord why does be ask him of me
first soldier what's he
parolles e'en a crow o the same nest not altogether so
 great as the first in goodness but greater a great
 deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward
 yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is
 in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming
 on he has the cramp
first soldier if your life be saved will you undertake to betray
 the florentine
parolles ay and the captain of his horse count rousillon
first soldier i'll whisper with the general and know his pleasure
parolles aside i'll no more drumming a plague of all
 drums only to seem to deserve well and to
 beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
 the count have i run into this danger yet who
 would have suspected an ambush where i was taken
first soldier there is no remedy sir but you must die the
 general says you that have so traitorously
 discovered the secrets of your army and made such
 pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can
 serve the world for no honest use therefore you
 must die come headsman off with his head
parolles o lord sir let me live or let me see my death

 to recompense your love doubt not but heaven
 hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower
 as it hath fated her to be my motive
 and helper to a husband but o strange men
 that can such sweet use make of what they hate
 when saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
 defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play
 with what it loathes for that which is away
 but more of this hereafter you diana
 under my poor instructions yet must suffer
 something in my behalf
diana let death and honesty
 go with your impositions i am yours
 upon your will to suffer
helena yet i pray you

 by the king than by that redtailed humblebee i speak of
countess i would i had not known him it was the death of the
 most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
 praise for creating if she had partaken of my
 flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother i
 could not have owed her a more rooted love
lafeu twas a good lady twas a good lady we may pick a
 thousand salads ere we light on such another herb

 great fire and the master i speak of ever keeps a
 good fire but sure he is the prince of the
 world let his nobility remain in's court i am for
 the house with the narrow gate which i take to be
 too little for pomp to enter some that humble
 themselves may but the many will be too chill and
 tender and they'll be for the flowery way that
 leads to the broad gate and the great fire
lafeu go thy ways i begin to be aweary of thee and i
 tell thee so before because i would not fall out
 with thee go thy ways let my horses be well
 looked to without any tricks
clown if i put any tricks upon em sir they shall be
 jades tricks which are their own right by the law of nature

lafeu i like him well tis not amiss and i was about to
 tell you since i heard of the good lady's death and
 that my lord your son was upon his return home i
 moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
 my daughter which in the minority of them both
 his majesty out of a selfgracious remembrance did
 first propose his highness hath promised me to do
 it and to stop up the displeasure he hath
 conceived against your son there is no fitter
 matter how does your ladyship like it
countess with very much content my lord and i wish it
 happily effected
lafeu his highness comes post from marseilles of as able
 body as when he numbered thirty he will be here

 intelligence hath seldom failed
countess it rejoices me that i hope i shall see him ere i
 die i have letters that my son will be here
 tonight i shall beseech your lordship to remain
 with me till they meet together
lafeu madam i was thinking with what manners i might
 safely be admitted

scene iii rousillon the count's palace
 flourish enter king countess lafeu the two
 french lords with attendants
king we lost a jewel of her and our esteem
 was made much poorer by it but your son
 as mad in folly lack'd the sense to know
 her estimation home
countess tis past my liege
 and i beseech your majesty to make it
 natural rebellion done i the blaze of youth
 when oil and fire too strong for reason's force
 o'erbears it and burns on
king my honour'd lady
 i have forgiven and forgotten all
 though my revenges were high bent upon him
 and watch'd the time to shoot
lafeu this i must say
 but first i beg my pardon the young lord
 did to his majesty his mother and his lady
 offence of mighty note but to himself
 the greatest wrong of all he lost a wife
 whose beauty did astonish the survey
 of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
 whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
 humbly call'd mistress
king praising what is lost
 makes the remembrance dear well call him hither
 we are reconciled and the first view shall kill
 all repetition let him not ask our pardon
 the nature of his great offence is dead
 and deeper than oblivion we do bury
 the incensing relics of it let him approach
 a stranger no offender and inform him
 so tis our will he should
gentleman i shall my liege
 exit
king what says he to your daughter have you spoke
lafeu all that he is hath reference to your highness
king then shall we have a match i have letters sent me
 that set him high in fame
 enter bertram
lafeu he looks well on't
king i am not a day of season
 for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
 in me at once but to the brightest beams
 distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth
 the time is fair again
bertram my highrepented blames
 dear sovereign pardon to me
king all is whole
 not one word more of the consumed time
 let's take the instant by the forward top
 for we are old and on our quick'st decrees
 the inaudible and noiseless foot of time
 steals ere we can effect them you remember
 the daughter of this lord
bertram admiringly my liege at first
 i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
 durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
 where the impression of mine eye infixing
 contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
 which warp'd the line of every other favour
 scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stolen
 extended or contracted all proportions
 to a most hideous object thence it came
 that she whom all men praised and whom myself
 since i have lost have loved was in mine eye
 the dust that did offend it
king well excused
 that thou didst love her strikes some scores away
 from the great compt but love that comes too late
 like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
 to the great sender turns a sour offence
 crying that's good that's gone our rash faults
 make trivial price of serious things we have
 not knowing them until we know their grave
 oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
 destroy our friends and after weep their dust
 our own love waking cries to see what's done
 while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon
 be this sweet helen's knell and now forget her
 send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin
 the main consents are had and here we'll stay
 to see our widower's second marriageday
countess which better than the first o dear heaven bless
 or ere they meet in me o nature cesse
lafeu come on my son in whom my house's name
 must be digested give a favour from you
 to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
 that she may quickly come
 bertram gives a ring
 by my old beard
 and every hair that's on't helen that's dead
 was a sweet creature such a ring as this
 the last that e'er i took her at court
 i saw upon her finger
bertram hers it was not
king now pray you let me see it for mine eye
 while i was speaking oft was fasten'd to't
 this ring was mine and when i gave it helen
 i bade her if her fortunes ever stood
 necessitied to help that by this token
 i would relieve her had you that craft to reave
 her
 of what should stead her most
bertram my gracious sovereign
 howe'er it pleases you to take it so
 the ring was never hers
countess son on my life
 i have seen her wear it and she reckon'd it
 at her life's rate
lafeu i am sure i saw her wear it
bertram you are deceived my lord she never saw it
 in florence was it from a casement thrown me
 wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name
 of her that threw it noble she was and thought
 i stood engaged but when i had subscribed
 to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
 i could not answer in that course of honour
 as she had made the overture she ceased
 in heavy satisfaction and would never
 receive the ring again
king plutus himself
 that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine
 hath not in nature's mystery more science
 than i have in this ring twas mine twas helen's
 whoever gave it you then if you know
 that you are well acquainted with yourself
 confess twas hers and by what rough enforcement
 you got it from her she call'd the saints to surety
 that she would never put it from her finger
 unless she gave it to yourself in bed
 where you have never come or sent it us
 upon her great disaster
bertram she never saw it
king thou speak'st it falsely as i love mine honour
 and makest conjectural fears to come into me
 which i would fain shut out if it should prove
 that thou art so inhuman'twill not prove so
 and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly
 and she is dead which nothing but to close
 her eyes myself could win me to believe
 more than to see this ring take him away
 guards seize bertram
 my forepast proofs howe'er the matter fall
 shall tax my fears of little vanity
 having vainly fear'd too little away with him
 we'll sift this matter further
bertram if you shall prove
 this ring was ever hers you shall as easy
 prove that i husbanded her bed in florence
 where yet she never was
 exit guarded
king i am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings
 enter a gentleman
gentleman gracious sovereign
 whether i have been to blame or no i know not
 here's a petition from a florentine
 who hath for four or five removes come short
 to tender it herself i undertook it
 vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
 of the poor suppliant who by this i know
 is here attending her business looks in her
 with an importing visage and she told me
 in a sweet verbal brief it did concern
 your highness with herself
king reads upon his many protestations to marry me
 when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won
 me now is the count rousillon a widower his vows
 are forfeited to me and my honour's paid to him he
 stole from florence taking no leave and i follow
 him to his country for justice grant it me o
 king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer
 flourishes and a poor maid is undone
 diana capilet
lafeu i will buy me a soninlaw in a fair and toll for
 this i'll none of him
king the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu
 to bring forth this discovery seek these suitors
 go speedily and bring again the count
 i am afeard the life of helen lady
 was foully snatch'd
countess now justice on the doers
 reenter bertram guarded
king i wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you
 and that you fly them as you swear them lordship
 yet you desire to marry
 enter widow and diana
 what woman's that
diana i am my lord a wretched florentine
 derived from the ancient capilet
 my suit as i do understand you know
 and therefore know how far i may be pitied
widow i am her mother sir whose age and honour
 both suffer under this complaint we bring
 and both shall cease without your remedy
king come hither count do you know these women
bertram my lord i neither can nor will deny
 but that i know them do they charge me further
diana why do you look so strange upon your wife
bertram she's none of mine my lord
diana if you shall marry
 you give away this hand and that is mine
 you give away heaven's vows and those are mine
 you give away myself which is known mine
 for i by vow am so embodied yours
 that she which marries you must marry me
 either both or none
lafeu your reputation comes too short for my daughter you
 are no husband for her
bertram my lord this is a fond and desperate creature
 whom sometime i have laugh'd with let your highness
 lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
 than for to think that i would sink it here
king sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
 till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour
 than in my thought it lies
diana good my lord
 ask him upon his oath if he does think
 he had not my virginity
king what say'st thou to her
bertram she's impudent my lord
 and was a common gamester to the camp
diana he does me wrong my lord if i were so
 he might have bought me at a common price
 do not believe him o behold this ring
 whose high respect and rich validity
 did lack a parallel yet for all that
 he gave it to a commoner o the camp
 if i be one
countess he blushes and tis it
 of six preceding ancestors that gem
 conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue
 hath it been owed and worn this is his wife
 that ring's a thousand proofs
king methought you said
 you saw one here in court could witness it
diana i did my lord but loath am to produce
 so bad an instrument his name's parolles
lafeu i saw the man today if man he be
king find him and bring him hither
 exit an attendant
bertram what of him
 he's quoted for a most perfidious slave
 with all the spots o the world tax'd and debosh'd
 whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
 am i or that or this for what he'll utter
 that will speak any thing
king she hath that ring of yours
bertram i think she has certain it is i liked her
 and boarded her i the wanton way of youth
 she knew her distance and did angle for me
 madding my eagerness with her restraint
 as all impediments in fancy's course
 are motives of more fancy and in fine
 her infinite cunning with her modern grace
 subdued me to her rate she got the ring
 and i had that which any inferior might
 at marketprice have bought
diana i must be patient
 you that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
 may justly diet me i pray you yet
 since you lack virtue i will lose a husband
 send for your ring i will return it home
 and give me mine again
bertram i have it not
king what ring was yours i pray you
diana sir much like
 the same upon your finger
king know you this ring this ring was his of late
diana and this was it i gave him being abed
king the story then goes false you threw it him
 out of a casement
diana i have spoke the truth
 enter parolles
bertram my lord i do confess the ring was hers
king you boggle shrewdly every feather stars you
 is this the man you speak of
diana ay my lord
king tell me sirrah but tell me true i charge you
 not fearing the displeasure of your master
 which on your just proceeding i'll keep off
 by him and by this woman here what know you
parolles so please your majesty my master hath been an
 honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him
 which gentlemen have
king come come to the purpose did he love this woman
parolles faith sir he did love her but how
king how i pray you
parolles he did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman
king how is that
parolles he loved her sir and loved her not
king as thou art a knave and no knave what an
 equivocal companion is this
parolles i am a poor man and at your majesty's command
lafeu he's a good drum my lord but a naughty orator
diana do you know he promised me marriage
parolles faith i know more than i'll speak
king but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest
parolles yes so please your majesty i did go between them
 as i said but more than that he loved her for
 indeed he was mad for her and talked of satan and
 of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i
 was in that credit with them at that time that i
 knew of their going to bed and of other motions
 as promising her marriage and things which would
 derive me ill will to speak of therefore i will not
 speak what i know
king thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say
 they are married but thou art too fine in thy
 evidence therefore stand aside
 this ring you say was yours
diana ay my good lord
king where did you buy it or who gave it you
diana it was not given me nor i did not buy it
king who lent it you
diana it was not lent me neither
king where did you find it then
diana i found it not
king if it were yours by none of all these ways
 how could you give it him
diana i never gave it him
lafeu this woman's an easy glove my lord she goes off
 and on at pleasure
king this ring was mine i gave it his first wife
diana it might be yours or hers for aught i know
king take her away i do not like her now
 to prison with her and away with him
 unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring
 thou diest within this hour
diana i'll never tell you
king take her away
diana i'll put in bail my liege
king i think thee now some common customer
diana by jove if ever i knew man twas you
king wherefore hast thou accused him all this while
diana because he's guilty and he is not guilty
 he knows i am no maid and he'll swear to't
 i'll swear i am a maid and he knows not
 great king i am no strumpet by my life
 i am either maid or else this old man's wife
king she does abuse our ears to prison with her
diana good mother fetch my bail stay royal sir
 exit widow
 the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
 and he shall surety me but for this lord
 who hath abused me as he knows himself
 though yet he never harm'd me here i quit him
 he knows himself my bed he hath defiled
 and at that time he got his wife with child
 dead though she be she feels her young one kick
 so there's my riddle one that's dead is quick
 and now behold the meaning
 reenter widow with helena
king is there no exorcist
 beguiles the truer office of mine eyes
 is't real that i see
helena no my good lord
 tis but the shadow of a wife you see
 the name and not the thing
bertram both both o pardon
helena o my good lord when i was like this maid
 i found you wondrous kind there is your ring
 and look you here's your letter this it says
 when from my finger you can get this ring
 and are by me with child &c this is done
 will you be mine now you are doubly won
bertram if she my liege can make me know this clearly
 i'll love her dearly ever ever dearly
helena if it appear not plain and prove untrue
 deadly divorce step between me and you
 o my dear mother do i see you living
lafeu mine eyes smell onions i shall weep anon
 to parolles
 good tom drum lend me a handkercher so
 i thank thee wait on me home i'll make sport with thee
 let thy courtesies alone they are scurvy ones
king let us from point to point this story know
 to make the even truth in pleasure flow
 to diana
 if thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower
 choose thou thy husband and i'll pay thy dower
 for i can guess that by thy honest aid
 thou keep'st a wife herself thyself a maid
 of that and all the progress more or less
 resolvedly more leisure shall express
 all yet seems well and if it end so meet
 the bitter past more welcome is the sweet
 flourish
 all's well that ends well
 epilogue
king the king's a beggar now the play is done
 all is well ended if this suit be won
 that you express content which we will pay
 with strife to please you day exceeding day
 ours be your patience then and yours our parts
 your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts

oliver call him in
 exit dennis
 twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is
 enter charles
charles good morrow to your worship
oliver good monsieur charles what's the new news at the
 new court
charles there's no news at the court sir but the old news
 that is the old duke is banished by his younger
 brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
 have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
 whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
 therefore he gives them good leave to wander
oliver can you tell if rosalind the duke's daughter be
 banished with her father
charles o no for the duke's daughter her cousin so loves
 her being ever from their cradles bred together
 that she would have followed her exile or have died
 to stay behind her she is at the court and no
 less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
 never two ladies loved as they do
oliver where will the old duke live
charles they say he is already in the forest of arden and
 a many merry men with him and there they live like
 the old robin hood of england they say many young
 gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
 carelessly as they did in the golden world
oliver what you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke
charles marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a
 matter i am given sir secretly to understand
 that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition
 to come in disguised against me to try a fall
 tomorrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that
 escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
 well your brother is but young and tender and
 for your love i would be loath to foil him as i
 must for my own honour if he come in therefore
 out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you
 withal that either you might stay him from his
 intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
 run into in that it is a thing of his own search
 and altogether against my will
oliver charles i thank thee for thy love to me which
 thou shalt find i will most kindly requite i had
 myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
 have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
 it but he is resolute i'll tell thee charles
 it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full
 of ambition an envious emulator of every man's
 good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
 me his natural brother therefore use thy
 discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck
 as his finger and thou wert best look to't for if
 thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
 mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
 against thee by poison entrap thee by some
 treacherous device and never leave thee till he
 hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other
 for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak
 it there is not one so young and so villanous this
 day living i speak but brotherly of him but
 should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must
 blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
charles i am heartily glad i came hither to you if he come
 tomorrow i'll give him his payment if ever he go
 alone again i'll never wrestle for prize more and
 so god keep your worship
oliver farewell good charles
 exit charles
 now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see
 an end of him for my soul yet i know not why
 hates nothing more than he yet he's gentle never
 schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
 all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
 in the heart of the world and especially of my own
 people who best know him that i am altogether
 misprised but it shall not be so long this
 wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
 i kindle the boy thither which now i'll go about
 exit
 as you like it
act i
scene ii lawn before the duke's palace
 enter celia and rosalind
celia i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry
rosalind dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of
 and would you yet i were merrier unless you could
 teach me to forget a banished father you must not
 learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
celia herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight
 that i love thee if my uncle thy banished father
 had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
 hadst been still with me i could have taught my
 love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
 if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
 tempered as mine is to thee
rosalind well i will forget the condition of my estate to
 rejoice in yours
celia you know my father hath no child but i nor none is
 like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
 be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
 father perforce i will render thee again in
 affection by mine honour i will and when i break
 that oath let me turn monster therefore my
 sweet rose my dear rose be merry
rosalind from henceforth i will coz and devise sports let
 me see what think you of falling in love
celia marry i prithee do to make sport withal but
 love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
 neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
 in honour come off again
rosalind what shall be our sport then
celia let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from
 her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
rosalind i would we could do so for her benefits are
 mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
 doth most mistake in her gifts to women
celia tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
 makes honest and those that she makes honest she
 makes very illfavouredly
rosalind nay now thou goest from fortune's office to
 nature's fortune reigns in gifts of the world
 not in the lineaments of nature
 enter touchstone
celia no when nature hath made a fair creature may she
 not by fortune fall into the fire though nature
 hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not
 fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
rosalind indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when
 fortune makes nature's natural the cutteroff of
 nature's wit
celia peradventure this is not fortune's work neither but
 nature's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
 to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
 natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
 the fool is the whetstone of the wits how now
 wit whither wander you
touchstone mistress you must come away to your father
celia were you made the messenger
touchstone no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you
rosalind where learned you that oath fool
touchstone of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
 were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
 mustard was naught now i'll stand to it the
 pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
 yet was not the knight forsworn
celia how prove you that in the great heap of your
 knowledge
rosalind ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
touchstone stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
 swear by your beards that i am a knave
celia by our beards if we had them thou art
touchstone by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you
 swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
 more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
 never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
 before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard
celia prithee who is't that thou meanest
touchstone one that old frederick your father loves
celia my father's love is enough to honour him enough
 speak no more of him you'll be whipped for taxation
 one of these days
touchstone the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
 wise men do foolishly
celia by my troth thou sayest true for since the little
 wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
 that wise men have makes a great show here comes
 monsieur le beau
rosalind with his mouth full of news
celia which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
rosalind then shall we be newscrammed
celia all the better we shall be the more marketable
 enter le beau
 bon jour monsieur le beau what's the news
le beau fair princess you have lost much good sport
celia sport of what colour
le beau what colour madam how shall i answer you
rosalind as wit and fortune will
touchstone or as the destinies decree
celia well said that was laid on with a trowel
touchstone nay if i keep not my rank
rosalind thou losest thy old smell
le beau you amaze me ladies i would have told you of good
 wrestling which you have lost the sight of
rosalind you tell us the manner of the wrestling
le beau i will tell you the beginning and if it please
 your ladyships you may see the end for the best is
 yet to do and here where you are they are coming
 to perform it
celia well the beginning that is dead and buried
le beau there comes an old man and his three sons
celia i could match this beginning with an old tale
le beau three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
rosalind with bills on their necks be it known unto all men
 by these presents'
le beau the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the
 duke's wrestler which charles in a moment threw him
 and broke three of his ribs that there is little
 hope of life in him so he served the second and
 so the third yonder they lie the poor old man
 their father making such pitiful dole over them
 that all the beholders take his part with weeping
rosalind alas
touchstone but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies
 have lost
le beau why this that i speak of
touchstone thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first
 time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport
 for ladies
celia or i i promise thee
rosalind but is there any else longs to see this broken music
 in his sides is there yet another dotes upon
 ribbreaking shall we see this wrestling cousin
le beau you must if you stay here for here is the place
 appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to
 perform it
celia yonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see it
 flourish enter duke frederick lords orlando

 own peril on his forwardness

celia alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
duke frederick how now daughter and cousin are you crept hither
 to see the wrestling
rosalind ay my liege so please you give us leave
duke frederick you will take little delight in it i can tell you
 there is such odds in the man in pity of the
 challenger's youth i would fain dissuade him but he
 will not be entreated speak to him ladies see if
 you can move him
celia call him hither good monsieur le beau
duke frederick do so i'll not be by
le beau monsieur the challenger the princesses call for you
orlando i attend them with all respect and duty
rosalind young man have you challenged charles the wrestler
orlando no fair princess he is the general challenger i
 come but in as others do to try with him the
 strength of my youth
celia young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your
 years you have seen cruel proof of this man's
 strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or
 knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your
 adventure would counsel you to a more equal
 enterprise we pray you for your own sake to
 embrace your own safety and give over this attempt
rosalind do young sir your reputation shall not therefore
 be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke
 that the wrestling might not go forward
orlando i beseech you punish me not with your hard
 thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny
 so fair and excellent ladies any thing but let
 your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
 trial wherein if i be foiled there is but one
 shamed that was never gracious if killed but one
 dead that was willing to be so i shall do my
 friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the
 world no injury for in it i have nothing only in
 the world i fill up a place which may be better
 supplied when i have made it empty
rosalind the little strength that i have i would it were with you
celia and mine to eke out hers
rosalind fare you well pray heaven i be deceived in you
celia your heart's desires be with you
charles come where is this young gallant that is so
 desirous to lie with his mother earth
orlando ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
duke frederick you shall try but one fall
charles no i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him
 to a second that have so mightily persuaded him
 from a first
orlando an you mean to mock me after you should not have
 mocked me before but come your ways
rosalind now hercules be thy speed young man
celia i would i were invisible to catch the strong
 fellow by the leg
 they wrestle
rosalind o excellent young man
celia if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye i can tell who
 should down
 shout charles is thrown
duke frederick no more no more
orlando yes i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathed
duke frederick how dost thou charles
le beau he cannot speak my lord
duke frederick bear him away what is thy name young man
orlando orlando my liege the youngest son of sir rowland de boys
duke frederick i would thou hadst been son to some man else
 the world esteem'd thy father honourable
 but i did find him still mine enemy
 thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
 hadst thou descended from another house
 but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
 i would thou hadst told me of another father
 exeunt duke frederick train and le beau
celia were i my father coz would i do this
orlando i am more proud to be sir rowland's son
 his youngest son and would not change that calling
 to be adopted heir to frederick
rosalind my father loved sir rowland as his soul
 and all the world was of my father's mind
 had i before known this young man his son
 i should have given him tears unto entreaties
 ere he should thus have ventured
celia gentle cousin
 let us go thank him and encourage him
 my father's rough and envious disposition
 sticks me at heart sir you have well deserved
 if you do keep your promises in love
 but justly as you have exceeded all promise
 your mistress shall be happy
rosalind gentleman
 giving him a chain from her neck
 wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
 that could give more but that her hand lacks means
 shall we go coz
celia ay fare you well fair gentleman
orlando can i not say i thank you my better parts
 are all thrown down and that which here stands up
 is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
rosalind he calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes
 i'll ask him what he would did you call sir
 sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
 more than your enemies
celia will you go coz
rosalind have with you fare you well
 exeunt rosalind and celia
orlando what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
 i cannot speak to her yet she urged conference
 o poor orlando thou art overthrown
 or charles or something weaker masters thee
 reenter le beau
le beau good sir i do in friendship counsel you
 to leave this place albeit you have deserved
 high commendation true applause and love
 yet such is now the duke's condition
 that he misconstrues all that you have done
 the duke is humorous what he is indeed
 more suits you to conceive than i to speak of
orlando i thank you sir and pray you tell me this
 which of the two was daughter of the duke
 that here was at the wrestling
le beau neither his daughter if we judge by manners
 but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
 the other is daughter to the banish'd duke
 and here detain'd by her usurping uncle
 to keep his daughter company whose loves
 are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
 but i can tell you that of late this duke
 hath ta'en displeasure gainst his gentle niece
 grounded upon no other argument
 but that the people praise her for her virtues
 and pity her for her good father's sake
 and on my life his malice gainst the lady
 will suddenly break forth sir fare you well
 hereafter in a better world than this
 i shall desire more love and knowledge of you
orlando i rest much bounden to you fare you well
 exit le beau
 thus must i from the smoke into the smother
 from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
 but heavenly rosalind
 exit

scene iii a room in the palace
 enter celia and rosalind
celia why cousin why rosalind cupid have mercy not a word
rosalind not one to throw at a dog
celia no thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
 curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
rosalind then there were two cousins laid up when the one
 should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
 without any
celia but is all this for your father
rosalind no some of it is for my child's father o how
 full of briers is this workingday world
celia they are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in
 holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden
 paths our very petticoats will catch them
rosalind i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart
celia hem them away
rosalind i would try if i could cry hem and have him
celia come come wrestle with thy affections
rosalind o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
celia o a good wish upon you you will try in time in
 despite of a fall but turning these jests out of
 service let us talk in good earnest is it
 possible on such a sudden you should fall into so
 strong a liking with old sir rowland's youngest son
rosalind the duke my father loved his father dearly
celia doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
 dearly by this kind of chase i should hate him
 for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate
 not orlando
rosalind no faith hate him not for my sake
celia why should i not doth he not deserve well
rosalind let me love him for that and do you love him
 because i do look here comes the duke
celia with his eyes full of anger
 enter duke frederick with lords
duke frederick mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
 and get you from our court
rosalind me uncle
duke frederick you cousin
 within these ten days if that thou be'st found
 so near our public court as twenty miles
 thou diest for it
rosalind i do beseech your grace
 let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
 if with myself i hold intelligence
 or have acquaintance with mine own desires
 if that i do not dream or be not frantic
 as i do trust i am notthen dear uncle
 never so much as in a thought unborn
 did i offend your highness
duke frederick thus do all traitors
 if their purgation did consist in words
 they are as innocent as grace itself
 let it suffice thee that i trust thee not
rosalind yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
 tell me whereon the likelihood depends
duke frederick thou art thy father's daughter there's enough
rosalind so was i when your highness took his dukedom
 so was i when your highness banish'd him
 treason is not inherited my lord
 or if we did derive it from our friends
 what's that to me my father was no traitor
 then good my liege mistake me not so much
 to think my poverty is treacherous
celia dear sovereign hear me speak
duke frederick ay celia we stay'd her for your sake
 else had she with her father ranged along
celia i did not then entreat to have her stay
 it was your pleasure and your own remorse
 i was too young that time to value her
 but now i know her if she be a traitor
 why so am i we still have slept together
 rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together
 and wheresoever we went like juno's swans
 still we went coupled and inseparable
duke frederick she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
 her very silence and her patience
 speak to the people and they pity her
 thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
 and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
 when she is gone then open not thy lips
 firm and irrevocable is my doom
 which i have pass'd upon her she is banish'd
celia pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
 i cannot live out of her company
duke frederick you are a fool you niece provide yourself
 if you outstay the time upon mine honour
 and in the greatness of my word you die
 exeunt duke frederick and lords
celia o my poor rosalind whither wilt thou go
 wilt thou change fathers i will give thee mine
 i charge thee be not thou more grieved than i am
rosalind i have more cause
celia thou hast not cousin
 prithee be cheerful know'st thou not the duke
 hath banish'd me his daughter
rosalind that he hath not
celia no hath not rosalind lacks then the love
 which teacheth thee that thou and i am one
 shall we be sunder'd shall we part sweet girl
 no let my father seek another heir
 therefore devise with me how we may fly
 whither to go and what to bear with us
 and do not seek to take your change upon you
 to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
 for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
 say what thou canst i'll go along with thee
rosalind why whither shall we go
celia to seek my uncle in the forest of arden
rosalind alas what danger will it be to us
 maids as we are to travel forth so far
 beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
celia i'll put myself in poor and mean attire
 and with a kind of umber smirch my face
 the like do you so shall we pass along
 and never stir assailants
rosalind were it not better
 because that i am more than common tall
 that i did suit me all points like a man
 a gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh
 a boarspear in my hand andin my heart
 lie there what hidden woman's fear there will
 we'll have a swashing and a martial outside
 as many other mannish cowards have
 that do outface it with their semblances
celia what shall i call thee when thou art a man
rosalind i'll have no worse a name than jove's own page
 and therefore look you call me ganymede
 but what will you be call'd
celia something that hath a reference to my state
 no longer celia but aliena
rosalind but cousin what if we assay'd to steal
 the clownish fool out of your father's court
 would he not be a comfort to our travel
celia he'll go along o'er the wide world with me
 leave me alone to woo him let's away
 and get our jewels and our wealth together
 devise the fittest time and safest way
 to hide us from pursuit that will be made
 after my flight now go we in content
 to liberty and not to banishment

act ii
scene i the forest of arden
 enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords
 like foresters
duke senior now my comates and brothers in exile
 hath not old custom made this life more sweet
 than that of painted pomp are not these woods
 more free from peril than the envious court
 here feel we but the penalty of adam
 the seasons difference as the icy fang
 and churlish chiding of the winter's wind
 which when it bites and blows upon my body
 even till i shrink with cold i smile and say
 this is no flattery these are counsellors
 that feelingly persuade me what i am'
 sweet are the uses of adversity
 which like the toad ugly and venomous
 wears yet a precious jewel in his head
 and this our life exempt from public haunt
 finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
 sermons in stones and good in every thing
 i would not change it
amiens happy is your grace
 that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
 into so quiet and so sweet a style
duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison
 and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
 being native burghers of this desert city
 should in their own confines with forked heads
 have their round haunches gored
first lord indeed my lord
 the melancholy jaques grieves at that
 and in that kind swears you do more usurp
 than doth your brother that hath banish'd you
 today my lord of amiens and myself
 did steal behind him as he lay along
 under an oak whose antique root peeps out
 upon the brook that brawls along this wood
 to the which place a poor sequester'd stag
 that from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt
 did come to languish and indeed my lord
 the wretched animal heaved forth such groans
 that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
 almost to bursting and the big round tears
 coursed one another down his innocent nose
 in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
 much marked of the melancholy jaques
 stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
 augmenting it with tears
duke senior but what said jaques
 did he not moralize this spectacle
first lord o yes into a thousand similes
 first for his weeping into the needless stream
 poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
 as worldlings do giving thy sum of more
 to that which had too much then being there alone
 left and abandon'd of his velvet friends
 'tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
 the flux of company anon a careless herd
 full of the pasture jumps along by him
 and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques
 sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
 tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
 upon that poor and broken bankrupt there'
 thus most invectively he pierceth through
 the body of the country city court
 yea and of this our life swearing that we
 are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse
 to fright the animals and to kill them up
 in their assign'd and native dwellingplace
duke senior and did you leave him in this contemplation
second lord we did my lord weeping and commenting
 upon the sobbing deer
duke senior show me the place
 i love to cope him in these sullen fits
 for then he's full of matter
first lord i'll bring you to him straight

scene ii a room in the palace
 enter duke frederick with lords
duke frederick can it be possible that no man saw them
 it cannot be some villains of my court
 are of consent and sufferance in this
first lord i cannot hear of any that did see her
 the ladies her attendants of her chamber
 saw her abed and in the morning early
 they found the bed untreasured of their mistress
second lord my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
 your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
 hisperia the princess gentlewoman
 confesses that she secretly o'erheard
 your daughter and her cousin much commend
 the parts and graces of the wrestler
 that did but lately foil the sinewy charles
 and she believes wherever they are gone
 that youth is surely in their company
duke frederick send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
 if he be absent bring his brother to me
 i'll make him find him do this suddenly
 and let not search and inquisition quail
 to bring again these foolish runaways

scene iii before oliver's house
 enter orlando and adam meeting
orlando who's there
adam what my young master o my gentle master
 o my sweet master o you memory
 of old sir rowland why what make you here
 why are you virtuous why do people love you
 and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
 why would you be so fond to overcome
 the bonny priser of the humorous duke
 your praise is come too swiftly home before you
 know you not master to some kind of men
 their graces serve them but as enemies
 no more do yours your virtues gentle master
 are sanctified and holy traitors to you
 o what a world is this when what is comely
 envenoms him that bears it
orlando why what's the matter
adam o unhappy youth
 come not within these doors within this roof
 the enemy of all your graces lives
 your brotherno no brother yet the son
 yet not the son i will not call him son
 of him i was about to call his father
 hath heard your praises and this night he means
 to burn the lodging where you use to lie
 and you within it if he fail of that
 he will have other means to cut you off
 i overheard him and his practises
 this is no place this house is but a butchery
 abhor it fear it do not enter it
orlando why whither adam wouldst thou have me go
adam no matter whither so you come not here
orlando what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
 or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
 a thievish living on the common road
 this i must do or know not what to do
 yet this i will not do do how i can
 i rather will subject me to the malice
 of a diverted blood and bloody brother
adam but do not so i have five hundred crowns
 the thrifty hire i saved under your father
 which i did store to be my fosternurse
 when service should in my old limbs lie lame
 and unregarded age in corners thrown
 take that and he that doth the ravens feed
 yea providently caters for the sparrow
 be comfort to my age here is the gold
 and all this i give you let me be your servant
 though i look old yet i am strong and lusty
 for in my youth i never did apply
 hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
 nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
 the means of weakness and debility
 therefore my age is as a lusty winter
 frosty but kindly let me go with you
 i'll do the service of a younger man
 in all your business and necessities
orlando o good old man how well in thee appears
 the constant service of the antique world
 when service sweat for duty not for meed
 thou art not for the fashion of these times
 where none will sweat but for promotion
 and having that do choke their service up
 even with the having it is not so with thee
 but poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
 that cannot so much as a blossom yield
 in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
 but come thy ways well go along together
 and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
 we'll light upon some settled low content
adam master go on and i will follow thee
 to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
 from seventeen years till now almost fourscore
 here lived i but now live here no more
 at seventeen years many their fortunes seek
 but at fourscore it is too late a week
 yet fortune cannot recompense me better
 than to die well and not my master's debtor

scene iv the forest of arden
 enter rosalind for ganymede celia for aliena

rosalind o jupiter how weary are my spirits
touchstone i care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
rosalind i could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
 apparel and to cry like a woman but i must comfort
 the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show
 itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage
 good aliena
celia i pray you bear with me i cannot go no further
touchstone for my part i had rather bear with you than bear
 you yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you
 for i think you have no money in your purse
rosalind well this is the forest of arden
touchstone ay now am i in arden the more fool i when i was
 at home i was in a better place but travellers
 must be content
rosalind ay be so good touchstone
 enter corin and silvius
 look you who comes here a young man and an old in
 solemn talk
corin that is the way to make her scorn you still
silvius o corin that thou knew'st how i do love her
corin i partly guess for i have loved ere now
silvius no corin being old thou canst not guess
 though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
 as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow
 but if thy love were ever like to mine
 as sure i think did never man love so
 how many actions most ridiculous
 hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
corin into a thousand that i have forgotten
silvius o thou didst then ne'er love so heartily
 if thou remember'st not the slightest folly
 that ever love did make thee run into
 thou hast not loved
 or if thou hast not sat as i do now
 wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
 thou hast not loved
 or if thou hast not broke from company
 abruptly as my passion now makes me
 thou hast not loved
 o phebe phebe phebe
 exit
rosalind alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
 i have by hard adventure found mine own
touchstone and i mine i remember when i was in love i broke
 my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
 coming anight to jane smile and i remember the
 kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
 pretty chopt hands had milked and i remember the
 wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom i took
 two cods and giving her them again said with
 weeping tears wear these for my sake we that are
 true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
 mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly
rosalind thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of
touchstone nay i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i
 break my shins against it
rosalind jove jove this shepherd's passion
 is much upon my fashion
touchstone and mine but it grows something stale with me
celia i pray you one of you question yond man
 if he for gold will give us any food
 i faint almost to death
touchstone holla you clown
rosalind peace fool he's not thy kinsman
corin who calls
touchstone your betters sir
corin else are they very wretched
rosalind peace i say good even to you friend
corin and to you gentle sir and to you all
rosalind i prithee shepherd if that love or gold
 can in this desert place buy entertainment
 bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
 here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
 and faints for succor
corin fair sir i pity her
 and wish for her sake more than for mine own
 my fortunes were more able to relieve her
 but i am shepherd to another man
 and do not shear the fleeces that i graze
 my master is of churlish disposition
 and little recks to find the way to heaven
 by doing deeds of hospitality
 besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
 are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
 by reason of his absence there is nothing
 that you will feed on but what is come see
 and in my voice most welcome shall you be
rosalind what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
corin that young swain that you saw here but erewhile
 that little cares for buying any thing
rosalind i pray thee if it stand with honesty
 buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
 and thou shalt have to pay for it of us
celia and we will mend thy wages i like this place
 and willingly could waste my time in it
corin assuredly the thing is to be sold
 go with me if you like upon report
 the soil the profit and this kind of life
 i will your very faithful feeder be
 and buy it with your gold right suddenly

jaques nay i care not for their names they owe me
 nothing will you sing
amiens more at your request than to please myself
jaques well then if ever i thank any man i'll thank you
 but that they call compliment is like the encounter
 of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
 methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me
 the beggarly thanks come sing and you that will
 not hold your tongues
amiens well i'll end the song sirs cover the while the
 duke will drink under this tree he hath been all
 this day to look you

 boast of them come warble come

act ii
scene vii the forest
 a table set out enter duke senior amiens and
 lords like outlaws
duke senior i think he be transform'd into a beast
 for i can no where find him like a man
first lord my lord he is but even now gone hence
 here was he merry hearing of a song
duke senior if he compact of jars grow musical
 we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
 go seek him tell him i would speak with him
 enter jaques
first lord he saves my labour by his own approach
duke senior why how now monsieur what a life is this
 that your poor friends must woo your company
 what you look merrily
jaques a fool a fool i met a fool i the forest
 a motley fool a miserable world
 as i do live by food i met a fool
 who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun
 and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms
 in good set terms and yet a motley fool
 good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he
 call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune'
 and then he drew a dial from his poke
 and looking on it with lacklustre eye
 says very wisely it is ten o'clock
 thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
 tis but an hour ago since it was nine
 and after one hour more twill be eleven
 and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
 and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
 and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear
 the motley fool thus moral on the time
 my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
 that fools should be so deepcontemplative
 and i did laugh sans intermission
 an hour by his dial o noble fool
 a worthy fool motley's the only wear
duke senior what fool is this
jaques o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier
 and says if ladies be but young and fair
 they have the gift to know it and in his brain
 which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
 after a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd
 with observation the which he vents
 in mangled forms o that i were a fool
 i am ambitious for a motley coat
duke senior thou shalt have one
jaques it is my only suit
 provided that you weed your better judgments
 of all opinion that grows rank in them
 that i am wise i must have liberty
 withal as large a charter as the wind
 to blow on whom i please for so fools have
 and they that are most galled with my folly
 they most must laugh and why sir must they so
 the why is plain as way to parish church
 he that a fool doth very wisely hit
 doth very foolishly although he smart
 not to seem senseless of the bob if not
 the wise man's folly is anatomized
 even by the squandering glances of the fool
 invest me in my motley give me leave
 to speak my mind and i will through and through
 cleanse the foul body of the infected world
 if they will patiently receive my medicine
duke senior fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do
jaques what for a counter would i do but good
duke senior most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
 for thou thyself hast been a libertine
 as sensual as the brutish sting itself
 and all the embossed sores and headed evils
 that thou with licence of free foot hast caught
 wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
jaques why who cries out on pride
 that can therein tax any private party
 doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
 till that the weary very means do ebb
 what woman in the city do i name
 when that i say the citywoman bears
 the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
 who can come in and say that i mean her
 when such a one as she such is her neighbour
 or what is he of basest function
 that says his bravery is not of my cost
 thinking that i mean him but therein suits
 his folly to the mettle of my speech
 there then how then what then let me see wherein
 my tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right
 then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free
 why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
 unclaim'd of any man but who comes here
 enter orlando with his sword drawn
orlando forbear and eat no more
jaques why i have eat none yet
orlando nor shalt not till necessity be served
jaques of what kind should this cock come of
duke senior art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress
 or else a rude despiser of good manners
 that in civility thou seem'st so empty
orlando you touch'd my vein at first the thorny point
 of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
 of smooth civility yet am i inland bred
 and know some nurture but forbear i say
 he dies that touches any of this fruit
 till i and my affairs are answered
jaques an you will not be answered with reason i must die
duke senior what would you have your gentleness shall force
 more than your force move us to gentleness
orlando i almost die for food and let me have it
duke senior sit down and feed and welcome to our table
orlando speak you so gently pardon me i pray you
 i thought that all things had been savage here
 and therefore put i on the countenance
 of stern commandment but whate'er you are
 that in this desert inaccessible
 under the shade of melancholy boughs
 lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
 if ever you have look'd on better days
 if ever been where bells have knoll'd to church
 if ever sat at any good man's feast
 if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
 and know what tis to pity and be pitied
 let gentleness my strong enforcement be
 in the which hope i blush and hide my sword
duke senior true is it that we have seen better days
 and have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
 and sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
 of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd
 and therefore sit you down in gentleness
 and take upon command what help we have
 that to your wanting may be minister'd
orlando then but forbear your food a little while
 whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn
 and give it food there is an old poor man
 who after me hath many a weary step
 limp'd in pure love till he be first sufficed
 oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger
 i will not touch a bit
duke senior go find him out
 and we will nothing waste till you return
orlando i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
 exit
duke senior thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
 this wide and universal theatre
 presents more woeful pageants than the scene
 wherein we play in
jaques all the world's a stage
 and all the men and women merely players
 they have their exits and their entrances
 and one man in his time plays many parts
 his acts being seven ages at first the infant
 mewling and puking in the nurse's arms
 and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
 and shining morning face creeping like snail
 unwillingly to school and then the lover
 sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
 made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier
 full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
 jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
 seeking the bubble reputation
 even in the cannon's mouth and then the justice
 in fair round belly with good capon lined
 with eyes severe and beard of formal cut
 full of wise saws and modern instances
 and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts
 into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon
 with spectacles on nose and pouch on side
 his youthful hose well saved a world too wide
 for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
 turning again toward childish treble pipes
 and whistles in his sound last scene of all
 that ends this strange eventful history
 is second childishness and mere oblivion
 sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
 reenter orlando with adam
duke senior welcome set down your venerable burthen
 and let him feed
orlando i thank you most for him
adam so had you need
 i scarce can speak to thank you for myself
duke senior welcome fall to i will not trouble you
 as yet to question you about your fortunes
 give us some music and good cousin sing
 
 song
amiens blow blow thou winter wind
 thou art not so unkind
 as man's ingratitude
 thy tooth is not so keen
 because thou art not seen
 although thy breath be rude
 heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
 most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
 then heighho the holly
 this life is most jolly
 freeze freeze thou bitter sky
 that dost not bite so nigh
 as benefits forgot
 though thou the waters warp
 thy sting is not so sharp
 as friend remember'd not
 heighho sing &c
duke senior if that you were the good sir rowland's son
 as you have whisper'd faithfully you were
 and as mine eye doth his effigies witness
 most truly limn'd and living in your face
 be truly welcome hither i am the duke
 that loved your father the residue of your fortune
 go to my cave and tell me good old man
 thou art right welcome as thy master is
 support him by the arm give me your hand
 and let me all your fortunes understand

orlando hang there my verse in witness of my love
 and thou thricecrowned queen of night survey
 with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above

 that every eye which in this forest looks
 shall see thy virtue witness'd every where
 run run orlando carve on every tree
 the fair the chaste and unexpressive she
 exit
 enter corin and touchstone
corin and how like you this shepherd's life master touchstone
touchstone truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
 life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life
 it is naught in respect that it is solitary i
 like it very well but in respect that it is
 private it is a very vile life now in respect it
 is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
 respect it is not in the court it is tedious as
 is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
 but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
 against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd
corin no more but that i know the more one sickens the
 worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
 means and content is without three good friends
 that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
 burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
 great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
 he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
 complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred
touchstone such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in
 court shepherd
corin no truly
touchstone then thou art damned
corin nay i hope
touchstone truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all
 on one side
corin for not being at court your reason
touchstone why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
 good manners if thou never sawest good manners
 then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
 sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous
 state shepherd
corin not a whit touchstone those that are good manners
 at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
 behavior of the country is most mockable at the
 court you told me you salute not at the court but
 you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
 uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
touchstone instance briefly come instance
corin why we are still handling our ewes and their
 fells you know are greasy
touchstone why do not your courtier's hands sweat and is not
 the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
 a man shallow shallow a better instance i say come
corin besides our hands are hard
touchstone your lips will feel them the sooner shallow again
 a more sounder instance come
corin and they are often tarred over with the surgery of
 our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the
 courtier's hands are perfumed with civet
touchstone most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a
 good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and
 perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
 very uncleanly flux of a cat mend the instance shepherd
corin you have too courtly a wit for me i'll rest
touchstone wilt thou rest damned god help thee shallow man
 god make incision in thee thou art raw
corin sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get
 that i wear owe no man hate envy no man's
 happiness glad of other men's good content with my
 harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
 graze and my lambs suck
touchstone that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
 and the rams together and to offer to get your
 living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
 bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a
 twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
 out of all reasonable match if thou beest not
 damned for this the devil himself will have no
 shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst
 scape
corin here comes young master ganymede my new mistress's brother
 enter rosalind with a paper reading
rosalind from the east to western ind
 no jewel is like rosalind
 her worth being mounted on the wind
 through all the world bears rosalind
 all the pictures fairest lined
 are but black to rosalind
 let no fair be kept in mind
 but the fair of rosalind
touchstone i'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
 suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
 right butterwomen's rank to market
rosalind out fool
touchstone for a taste
 if a hart do lack a hind
 let him seek out rosalind
 if the cat will after kind
 so be sure will rosalind
 winter garments must be lined
 so must slender rosalind
 they that reap must sheaf and bind
 then to cart with rosalind
 sweetest nut hath sourest rind
 such a nut is rosalind
 he that sweetest rose will find
 must find love's prick and rosalind
 this is the very false gallop of verses why do you
 infect yourself with them
rosalind peace you dull fool i found them on a tree
touchstone truly the tree yields bad fruit
rosalind i'll graff it with you and then i shall graff it
 with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
 i the country for you'll be rotten ere you be half
 ripe and that's the right virtue of the medlar
touchstone you have said but whether wisely or no let the
 forest judge
 enter celia with a writing
rosalind peace here comes my sister reading stand aside
celia reads
 why should this a desert be
 for it is unpeopled no
 tongues i'll hang on every tree
 that shall civil sayings show
 some how brief the life of man
 runs his erring pilgrimage
 that the stretching of a span
 buckles in his sum of age
 some of violated vows
 twixt the souls of friend and friend
 but upon the fairest boughs
 or at every sentence end
 will i rosalinda write
 teaching all that read to know
 the quintessence of every sprite
 heaven would in little show
 therefore heaven nature charged
 that one body should be fill'd
 with all graces wideenlarged
 nature presently distill'd
 helen's cheek but not her heart
 cleopatra's majesty
 atalanta's better part
 sad lucretia's modesty
 thus rosalind of many parts
 by heavenly synod was devised
 of many faces eyes and hearts
 to have the touches dearest prized
 heaven would that she these gifts should have
 and i to live and die her slave
rosalind o most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
 have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
 cried have patience good people'
celia how now back friends shepherd go off a little
 go with him sirrah
touchstone come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
 though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
 exeunt corin and touchstone
celia didst thou hear these verses
rosalind o yes i heard them all and more too for some of
 them had in them more feet than the verses would bear
celia that's no matter the feet might bear the verses
rosalind ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
 themselves without the verse and therefore stood
 lamely in the verse
celia but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
 should be hanged and carved upon these trees
rosalind i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
 before you came for look here what i found on a
 palmtree i was never so berhymed since
 pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i
 can hardly remember
celia trow you who hath done this
rosalind is it a man
celia and a chain that you once wore about his neck
 change you colour
rosalind i prithee who
celia o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to
 meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
 and so encounter
rosalind nay but who is it
celia is it possible
rosalind nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
 tell me who it is
celia o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
 wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
 out of all hooping
rosalind good my complexion dost thou think though i am
 caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in
 my disposition one inch of delay more is a
 southsea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it
 quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst
 stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
 out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
 mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
 all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
 may drink thy tidings
celia so you may put a man in your belly
rosalind is he of god's making what manner of man is his
 head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
celia nay he hath but a little beard
rosalind why god will send more if the man will be
 thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
 thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin
celia it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestler's
 heels and your heart both in an instant
rosalind nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and
 true maid
celia i faith coz tis he
rosalind orlando
celia orlando
rosalind alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and
 hose what did he when thou sawest him what said
 he how looked he wherein went he what makes
 him here did he ask for me where remains he
 how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see
 him again answer me in one word
celia you must borrow me gargantua's mouth first tis a
 word too great for any mouth of this age's size to
 say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
 answer in a catechism
rosalind but doth he know that i am in this forest and in
 man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the
 day he wrestled
celia it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
 propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
 finding him and relish it with good observance
 i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn
rosalind it may well be called jove's tree when it drops
 forth such fruit
celia give me audience good madam
rosalind proceed
celia there lay he stretched along like a wounded knight
rosalind though it be pity to see such a sight it well
 becomes the ground
celia cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets
 unseasonably he was furnished like a hunter
rosalind o ominous he comes to kill my heart
celia i would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
 me out of tune
rosalind do you not know i am a woman when i think i must
 speak sweet say on
celia you bring me out soft comes he not here
 enter orlando and jaques
rosalind tis he slink by and note him
jaques i thank you for your company but good faith i had
 as lief have been myself alone
orlando and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you
 too for your society
jaques god be wi you let's meet as little as we can
orlando i do desire we may be better strangers
jaques i pray you mar no more trees with writing
 lovesongs in their barks
orlando i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
 them illfavouredly
jaques rosalind is your love's name
orlando yes just
jaques i do not like her name
orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was
 christened
jaques what stature is she of
orlando just as high as my heart
jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been
 acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
 out of rings
orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from
 whence you have studied your questions
jaques you have a nimble wit i think twas made of
 atalanta's heels will you sit down with me and
 we two will rail against our mistress the world and
 all our misery
orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself
 against whom i know most faults
jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love
orlando tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue
 i am weary of you
jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found
 you
orlando he is drowned in the brook look but in and you
 shall see him
jaques there i shall see mine own figure
orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher
jaques i'll tarry no longer with you farewell good
 signior love
orlando i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur
 melancholy
 exit jaques
rosalind aside to celia i will speak to him like a saucy
 lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
 do you hear forester
orlando very well what would you
rosalind i pray you what is't o'clock
orlando you should ask me what time o day there's no clock
 in the forest
rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else
 sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
 detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock
orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that
 been as proper
rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with
 divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles
 withal who time trots withal who time gallops
 withal and who he stands still withal
orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal
rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
 contract of her marriage and the day it is
 solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight
 time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
 seven year
orlando who ambles time withal
rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that
 hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
 he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
 he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
 and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
 of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal
orlando who doth he gallop withal
rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as
 softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
orlando who stays it still withal
rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
 term and term and then they perceive not how time moves
orlando where dwell you pretty youth
rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the
 skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
orlando are you native of this place
rosalind as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled
orlando your accent is something finer than you could
 purchase in so removed a dwelling
rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old
 religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
 in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
 too well for there he fell in love i have heard
 him read many lectures against it and i thank god
 i am not a woman to be touched with so many
 giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
 whole sex withal
orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he
 laid to the charge of women
rosalind there were none principal they were all like one
 another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
 monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it
orlando i prithee recount some of them
rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that
 are sick there is a man haunts the forest that
 abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on
 their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
 on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
 rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would
 give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
 quotidian of love upon him
orlando i am he that is so loveshaked i pray you tell me
 your remedy
rosalind there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he
 taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
 of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner
orlando what were his marks
rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
 sunken which you have not an unquestionable
 spirit which you have not a beard neglected
 which you have not but i pardon you for that for
 simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
 revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
 bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
 untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
 careless desolation but you are no such man you
 are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
 loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other
orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love
rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you
 love believe it which i warrant she is apter to
 do than to confess she does that is one of the
 points in the which women still give the lie to
 their consciences but in good sooth are you he
 that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind
 is so admired
orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of
 rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he
rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves
 as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
 the reason why they are not so punished and cured
 is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
 are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel
orlando did you ever cure any so
rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me
 his love his mistress and i set him every day to
 woo me at which time would i being but a moonish
 youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
 and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
 inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
 passion something and for no passion truly any
 thing as boys and women are for the most part
 cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
 him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
 for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor
 from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
 madness which was to forswear the full stream of
 the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
 and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon
 me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
 heart that there shall not be one spot of love in't
orlando i would not be cured youth
rosalind i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind
 and come every day to my cote and woo me
orlando now by the faith of my love i will tell me
 where it is
rosalind go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way
 you shall tell me where in the forest you live
 will you go
orlando with all my heart good youth
rosalind nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go
 exeunt

scene iii the forest
 enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind
touchstone come apace good audrey i will fetch up your
 goats audrey and how audrey am i the man yet
 doth my simple feature content you
audrey your features lord warrant us what features
touchstone i am here with thee and thy goats as the most
 capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths
jaques aside o knowledge illinhabited worse than jove
 in a thatched house
touchstone when a man's verses cannot be understood nor a
 man's good wit seconded with the forward child
 understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
 great reckoning in a little room truly i would
 the gods had made thee poetical
audrey i do not know what poetical is is it honest in
 deed and word is it a true thing
touchstone no truly for the truest poetry is the most
 feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
 they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign
audrey do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
touchstone i do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
 honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some
 hope thou didst feign
audrey would you not have me honest
touchstone no truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
 honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
jaques aside a material fool
audrey well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods
 make me honest
touchstone truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
 were to put good meat into an unclean dish
audrey i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul
touchstone well praised be the gods for thy foulness
 sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may
 be i will marry thee and to that end i have been
 with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next
 village who hath promised to meet me in this place
 of the forest and to couple us
jaques aside i would fain see this meeting
audrey well the gods give us joy
touchstone amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart
 stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
 but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts but what
 though courage as horns are odious they are
 necessary it is said many a man knows no end of
 his goods right many a man has good horns and
 knows no end of them well that is the dowry of
 his wife tis none of his own getting horns
 even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer
 hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man
 therefore blessed no as a walled town is more
 worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
 married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
 bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
 skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
 want here comes sir oliver
 enter sir oliver martext
 sir oliver martext you are well met will you
 dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go
 with you to your chapel
sir oliver martext is there none here to give the woman
touchstone i will not take her on gift of any man
sir oliver martext truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
jaques advancing
 proceed proceed i'll give her
touchstone good even good master whatyecall't how do you
 sir you are very well met god ild you for your
 last company i am very glad to see you even a
 toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered
jaques will you be married motley
touchstone as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
 the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and
 as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling
jaques and will you being a man of your breeding be
 married under a bush like a beggar get you to
 church and have a good priest that can tell you
 what marriage is this fellow will but join you
 together as they join wainscot then one of you will
 prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
touchstone aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be
 married of him than of another for he is not like
 to marry me well and not being well married it
 will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife
jaques go thou with me and let me counsel thee
touchstone come sweet audrey
 we must be married or we must live in bawdry
 farewell good master oliver not
 o sweet oliver
 o brave oliver
 leave me not behind thee but
 wind away
 begone i say
 i will not to wedding with thee
 exeunt jaques touchstone and audrey

 all shall flout me out of my calling

scene iv the forest
 enter rosalind and celia
rosalind never talk to me i will weep
celia do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider
 that tears do not become a man
rosalind but have i not cause to weep
celia as good cause as one would desire therefore weep
rosalind his very hair is of the dissembling colour
celia something browner than judas's marry his kisses are
 judas's own children
rosalind i faith his hair is of a good colour
celia an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
 of holy bread
celia he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun
 of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously
 the very ice of chastity is in them
rosalind but why did he swear he would come this morning and
 comes not
celia nay certainly there is no truth in him
rosalind do you think so
celia yes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a
 horsestealer but for his verity in love i do
 think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
 wormeaten nut
rosalind not true in love
celia yes when he is in but i think he is not in
rosalind you have heard him swear downright he was
celia was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
 no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
 both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends
 here in the forest on the duke your father
rosalind i met the duke yesterday and had much question with
 him he asked me of what parentage i was i told
 him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
 but what talk we of fathers when there is such a
 man as orlando
celia o that's a brave man he writes brave verses
 speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks
 them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of
 his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse
 but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
 goose but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
 guides who comes here
 enter corin
corin mistress and master you have oft inquired
 after the shepherd that complain'd of love
 who you saw sitting by me on the turf
 praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
 that was his mistress
celia well and what of him
corin if you will see a pageant truly play'd
 between the pale complexion of true love
 and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
 go hence a little and i shall conduct you
 if you will mark it
rosalind o come let us remove
 the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
 bring us to this sight and you shall say
 i'll prove a busy actor in their play
 exeunt

scene v another part of the forest
 enter silvius and phebe
silvius sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe
 say that you love me not but say not so
 in bitterness the common executioner
 whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard
 falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
 but first begs pardon will you sterner be
 than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
 enter rosalind celia and corin behind
phebe i would not be thy executioner
 i fly thee for i would not injure thee
 thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye
 tis pretty sure and very probable
 that eyes that are the frail'st and softest things
 who shut their coward gates on atomies
 should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers
 now i do frown on thee with all my heart
 and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
 now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
 or if thou canst not o for shame for shame
 lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
 now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
 scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
 some scar of it lean but upon a rush
 the cicatrice and capable impressure
 thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
 which i have darted at thee hurt thee not
 nor i am sure there is no force in eyes
 that can do hurt
silvius o dear phebe
 if everas that ever may be near
 you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
 then shall you know the wounds invisible
 that love's keen arrows make
phebe but till that time
 come not thou near me and when that time comes
 afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
 as till that time i shall not pity thee
rosalind and why i pray you who might be your mother
 that you insult exult and all at once
 over the wretched what though you have no beauty
 as by my faith i see no more in you
 than without candle may go dark to bed
 must you be therefore proud and pitiless
 why what means this why do you look on me
 i see no more in you than in the ordinary
 of nature's salework od's my little life
 i think she means to tangle my eyes too
 no faith proud mistress hope not after it
 tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
 your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
 that can entame my spirits to your worship
 you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
 like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
 you are a thousand times a properer man
 than she a woman tis such fools as you
 that makes the world full of illfavour'd children
 tis not her glass but you that flatters her
 and out of you she sees herself more proper
 than any of her lineaments can show her
 but mistress know yourself down on your knees
 and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love
 for i must tell you friendly in your ear
 sell when you can you are not for all markets
 cry the man mercy love him take his offer
 foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
 so take her to thee shepherd fare you well
phebe sweet youth i pray you chide a year together
 i had rather hear you chide than this man woo
rosalind he's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
 fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as
 she answers thee with frowning looks i'll sauce her
 with bitter words why look you so upon me
phebe for no ill will i bear you
rosalind i pray you do not fall in love with me
 for i am falser than vows made in wine
 besides i like you not if you will know my house
 tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
 will you go sister shepherd ply her hard
 come sister shepherdess look on him better
 and be not proud though all the world could see
 none could be so abused in sight as he
 come to our flock
 exeunt rosalind celia and corin
phebe dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might
 who ever loved that loved not at first sight'
silvius sweet phebe
phebe ha what say'st thou silvius
silvius sweet phebe pity me
phebe why i am sorry for thee gentle silvius
silvius wherever sorrow is relief would be
 if you do sorrow at my grief in love
 by giving love your sorrow and my grief
 were both extermined
phebe thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
silvius i would have you
phebe why that were covetousness
 silvius the time was that i hated thee
 and yet it is not that i bear thee love
 but since that thou canst talk of love so well
 thy company which erst was irksome to me
 i will endure and i'll employ thee too
 but do not look for further recompense
 than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd
silvius so holy and so perfect is my love
 and i in such a poverty of grace
 that i shall think it a most plenteous crop
 to glean the broken ears after the man
 that the main harvest reaps loose now and then
 a scatter'd smile and that i'll live upon
phebe know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile
silvius not very well but i have met him oft
 and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
 that the old carlot once was master of
phebe think not i love him though i ask for him
 tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
 but what care i for words yet words do well
 when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
 it is a pretty youth not very pretty
 but sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him
 he'll make a proper man the best thing in him
 is his complexion and faster than his tongue
 did make offence his eye did heal it up
 he is not very tall yet for his years he's tall
 his leg is but so so and yet tis well
 there was a pretty redness in his lip
 a little riper and more lusty red
 than that mix'd in his cheek twas just the difference
 between the constant red and mingled damask
 there be some women silvius had they mark'd him
 in parcels as i did would have gone near
 to fall in love with him but for my part
 i love him not nor hate him not and yet
 i have more cause to hate him than to love him
 for what had he to do to chide at me
 he said mine eyes were black and my hair black
 and now i am remember'd scorn'd at me
 i marvel why i answer'd not again
 but that's all one omittance is no quittance
 i'll write to him a very taunting letter
 and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius
silvius phebe with all my heart
phebe i'll write it straight
 the matter's in my head and in my heart
 i will be bitter with him and passing short
 go with me silvius

act iv
scene i the forest
 enter rosalind celia and jaques
jaques i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
 with thee
rosalind they say you are a melancholy fellow
jaques i am so i do love it better than laughing
rosalind those that are in extremity of either are abominable
 fellows and betray themselves to every modern
 censure worse than drunkards
jaques why tis good to be sad and say nothing
rosalind why then tis good to be a post
jaques i have neither the scholar's melancholy which is
 emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical
 nor the courtier's which is proud nor the
 soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's
 which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor
 the lover's which is all these but it is a
 melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
 extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry's
 contemplation of my travels in which my often
 rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness
rosalind a traveller by my faith you have great reason to
 be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see
 other men's then to have seen much and to have
 nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
jaques yes i have gained my experience
rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have
 a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
 sad and to travel for it too
 enter orlando
orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind
jaques nay then god be wi you an you talk in blank verse
 exit
rosalind farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and
 wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
 own country be out of love with your nativity and
 almost chide god for making you that countenance you
 are or i will scarce think you have swam in a
 gondola why how now orlando where have you been
 all this while you a lover an you serve me such
 another trick never come in my sight more
orlando my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise
rosalind break an hour's promise in love he that will
 divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
 a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
 affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid
 hath clapped him o the shoulder but i'll warrant
 him heartwhole
orlando pardon me dear rosalind
rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i
 had as lief be wooed of a snail
orlando of a snail
rosalind ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
 carries his house on his head a better jointure
 i think than you make a woman besides he brings
 his destiny with him
orlando what's that
rosalind why horns which such as you are fain to be
 beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
 his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife
orlando virtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous
rosalind and i am your rosalind
celia it pleases him to call you so but he hath a
 rosalind of a better leer than you
rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday
 humour and like enough to consent what would you
 say to me now an i were your very very rosalind
orlando i would kiss before i spoke
rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were
 gravelled for lack of matter you might take
 occasion to kiss very good orators when they are
 out they will spit and for lovers lackinggod
 warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss
orlando how if the kiss be denied
rosalind then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter
orlando who could be out being before his beloved mistress
rosalind marry that should you if i were your mistress or
 i should think my honesty ranker than my wit
orlando what of my suit
rosalind not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
 am not i your rosalind
orlando i take some joy to say you are because i would be
 talking of her
rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you
orlando then in mine own person i die
rosalind no faith die by attorney the poor world is
 almost six thousand years old and in all this time
 there was not any man died in his own person
 videlicit in a lovecause troilus had his brains
 dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he
 could to die before and he is one of the patterns
 of love leander he would have lived many a fair
 year though hero had turned nun if it had not been
 for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
 but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being
 taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
 coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos'
 but these are all lies men have died from time to
 time and worms have eaten them but not for love
orlando i would not have my right rosalind of this mind
 for i protest her frown might kill me
rosalind by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now
 i will be your rosalind in a more comingon
 disposition and ask me what you will i will grant
 it
orlando then love me rosalind
rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all
orlando and wilt thou have me
rosalind ay and twenty such
orlando what sayest thou
rosalind are you not good
orlando i hope so
rosalind why then can one desire too much of a good thing
 come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
 give me your hand orlando what do you say sister
orlando pray thee marry us
celia i cannot say the words
rosalind you must begin will you orlando'
celia go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind
orlando i will
rosalind ay but when
orlando why now as fast as she can marry us
rosalind then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife'
orlando i take thee rosalind for wife
rosalind i might ask you for your commission but i do take
 thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes
 before the priest and certainly a woman's thought
 runs before her actions
orlando so do all thoughts they are winged
rosalind now tell me how long you would have her after you
 have possessed her
orlando for ever and a day
rosalind say a day without the ever no no orlando
 men are april when they woo december when they wed
 maids are may when they are maids but the sky
 changes when they are wives i will be more jealous
 of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen
 more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
 newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
 than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana
 in the fountain and i will do that when you are
 disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and
 that when thou art inclined to sleep
orlando but will my rosalind do so
rosalind by my life she will do as i do
orlando o but she is wise
rosalind or else she could not have the wit to do this the
 wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's
 wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
 twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly
 with the smoke out at the chimney
orlando a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
 wit whither wilt'
rosalind nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
 your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed
orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that
rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall
 never take her without her answer unless you take
 her without her tongue o that woman that cannot
 make her fault her husband's occasion let her
 never nurse her child herself for she will breed
 it like a fool
orlando for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee
rosalind alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours
orlando i must attend the duke at dinner by two o'clock i
 will be with thee again
rosalind ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you
 would prove my friends told me as much and i
 thought no less that flattering tongue of yours
 won me tis but one cast away and so come
 death two o'clock is your hour
orlando ay sweet rosalind
rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend
 me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
 if you break one jot of your promise or come one
 minute behind your hour i will think you the most
 pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
 and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that
 may be chosen out of the gross band of the
 unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
 your promise
orlando with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
 rosalind so adieu
rosalind well time is the old justice that examines all such
 offenders and let time try adieu
 exit orlando
celia you have simply misused our sex in your loveprate
 we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
 head and show the world what the bird hath done to
 her own nest
rosalind o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
 didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but
 it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
 bottom like the bay of portugal
celia or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
 affection in it runs out
rosalind no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot
 of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
 that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
 because his own are out let him be judge how deep i
 am in love i'll tell thee aliena i cannot be out
 of the sight of orlando i'll go find a shadow and
 sigh till he come

rosalind how say you now is it not past two o'clock and
 here much orlando
celia i warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he
 hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
 sleep look who comes here
 enter silvius
silvius my errand is to you fair youth
 my gentle phebe bid me give you this
 i know not the contents but as i guess
 by the stern brow and waspish action
 which she did use as she was writing of it
 it bears an angry tenor pardon me
 i am but as a guiltless messenger
rosalind patience herself would startle at this letter
 and play the swaggerer bear this bear all
 she says i am not fair that i lack manners
 she calls me proud and that she could not love me
 were man as rare as phoenix od's my will
 her love is not the hare that i do hunt
 why writes she so to me well shepherd well
 this is a letter of your own device
silvius no i protest i know not the contents
 phebe did write it
rosalind come come you are a fool
 and turn'd into the extremity of love
 i saw her hand she has a leathern hand
 a freestonecolour'd hand i verily did think
 that her old gloves were on but twas her hands
 she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter
 i say she never did invent this letter
 this is a man's invention and his hand
silvius sure it is hers
rosalind why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
 a style forchallengers why she defies me
 like turk to christian women's gentle brain
 could not drop forth such giantrude invention
 such ethiope words blacker in their effect
 than in their countenance will you hear the letter
silvius so please you for i never heard it yet
 yet heard too much of phebe's cruelty
rosalind she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
 reads
 art thou god to shepherd turn'd
 that a maiden's heart hath burn'd
 can a woman rail thus
silvius call you this railing
rosalind reads
 why thy godhead laid apart
 warr'st thou with a woman's heart
 did you ever hear such railing
 whiles the eye of man did woo me
 that could do no vengeance to me
 meaning me a beast
 if the scorn of your bright eyne
 have power to raise such love in mine
 alack in me what strange effect
 would they work in mild aspect
 whiles you chid me i did love
 how then might your prayers move
 he that brings this love to thee
 little knows this love in me
 and by him seal up thy mind
 whether that thy youth and kind
 will the faithful offer take
 of me and all that i can make
 or else by him my love deny
 and then i'll study how to die
silvius call you this chiding
celia alas poor shepherd
rosalind do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt
 thou love such a woman what to make thee an
 instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
 be endured well go your way to her for i see
 love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
 her that if she love me i charge her to love
 thee if she will not i will never have her unless
 thou entreat for her if you be a true lover
 hence and not a word for here comes more company
 exit silvius

oliver good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
 where in the purlieus of this forest stands
 a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees
celia west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
 the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
 left on your right hand brings you to the place
 but at this hour the house doth keep itself
 there's none within
oliver if that an eye may profit by a tongue
 then should i know you by description
 such garments and such years the boy is fair
 of female favour and bestows himself
 like a ripe sister the woman low
 and browner than her brother are not you
 the owner of the house i did inquire for
celia it is no boast being ask'd to say we are
oliver orlando doth commend him to you both
 and to that youth he calls his rosalind
 he sends this bloody napkin are you he
rosalind i am what must we understand by this
oliver some of my shame if you will know of me
 what man i am and how and why and where
 this handkercher was stain'd
celia i pray you tell it
oliver when last the young orlando parted from you
 he left a promise to return again
 within an hour and pacing through the forest
 chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
 lo what befell he threw his eye aside
 and mark what object did present itself
 under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age
 and high top bald with dry antiquity
 a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair
 lay sleeping on his back about his neck
 a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
 who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
 the opening of his mouth but suddenly
 seeing orlando it unlink'd itself
 and with indented glides did slip away
 into a bush under which bush's shade
 a lioness with udders all drawn dry
 lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
 when that the sleeping man should stir for tis
 the royal disposition of that beast
 to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
 this seen orlando did approach the man
 and found it was his brother his elder brother
celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother
 and he did render him the most unnatural
 that lived amongst men
oliver and well he might so do
 for well i know he was unnatural
rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there
 food to the suck'd and hungry lioness
oliver twice did he turn his back and purposed so
 but kindness nobler ever than revenge
 and nature stronger than his just occasion
 made him give battle to the lioness
 who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
 from miserable slumber i awaked
celia are you his brother
rosalind wast you he rescued
celia was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him
oliver twas i but tis not i i do not shame
 to tell you what i was since my conversion
 so sweetly tastes being the thing i am
rosalind but for the bloody napkin
oliver by and by
 when from the first to last betwixt us two
 tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
 as how i came into that desert place
 in brief he led me to the gentle duke
 who gave me fresh array and entertainment
 committing me unto my brother's love
 who led me instantly unto his cave
 there stripp'd himself and here upon his arm
 the lioness had torn some flesh away
 which all this while had bled and now he fainted
 and cried in fainting upon rosalind
 brief i recover'd him bound up his wound
 and after some small space being strong at heart
 he sent me hither stranger as i am
 to tell this story that you might excuse
 his broken promise and to give this napkin
 dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
 that he in sport doth call his rosalind
 rosalind swoons
celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede
oliver many will swoon when they do look on blood
celia there is more in it cousin ganymede
oliver look he recovers
rosalind i would i were at home
celia we'll lead you thither
 i pray you will you take him by the arm
oliver be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a
 man's heart
rosalind i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would
 think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell
 your brother how well i counterfeited heighho
oliver this was not counterfeit there is too great
 testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
 of earnest
rosalind counterfeit i assure you
oliver well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
rosalind so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right
celia come you look paler and paler pray you draw
 homewards good sir go with us
oliver that will i for i must bear answer back
 how you excuse my brother rosalind
rosalind i shall devise something but i pray you commend
 my counterfeiting to him will you go

rosalind o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee
 wear thy heart in a scarf
orlando it is my arm
rosalind i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
 of a lion
orlando wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady
rosalind did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to
 swoon when he showed me your handkerchief
orlando ay and greater wonders than that
rosalind o i know where you are nay tis true there was
 never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
 and caesar's thrasonical brag of i came saw and
 overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
 met but they looked no sooner looked but they
 loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
 sighed but they asked one another the reason no
 sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy
 and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
 to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
 else be incontinent before marriage they are in
 the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
 cannot part them
orlando they shall be married tomorrow and i will bid the
 duke to the nuptial but o how bitter a thing it
 is to look into happiness through another man's
 eyes by so much the more shall i tomorrow be at
 the height of heartheaviness by how much i shall
 think my brother happy in having what he wishes for
rosalind why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind
orlando i can live no longer by thinking
rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking

 magician most profound in his art and yet not
 damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart

 marries aliena shall you marry her i know into
 what straits of fortune she is driven and it is
 not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient
 to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
 as she is and without any danger

 you'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd

 or else refusing me to wed this shepherd
 keep your word silvius that you'll marry her

 exeunt rosalind and celia
duke senior i do remember in this shepherd boy
 some lively touches of my daughter's favour
orlando my lord the first time that i ever saw him
 methought he was a brother to your daughter
 but my good lord this boy is forestborn
 and hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
 of many desperate studies by his uncle
 whom he reports to be a great magician
 obscured in the circle of this forest
 enter touchstone and audrey
jaques there is sure another flood toward and these
 couples are coming to the ark here comes a pair of
 very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools
touchstone salutation and greeting to you all
jaques good my lord bid him welcome this is the
 motleyminded gentleman that i have so often met in
 the forest he hath been a courtier he swears
touchstone if any man doubt that let him put me to my
 purgation i have trod a measure i have flattered
 a lady i have been politic with my friend smooth
 with mine enemy i have undone three tailors i have
 had four quarrels and like to have fought one
jaques and how was that ta'en up
touchstone faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the
 seventh cause
jaques how seventh cause good my lord like this fellow
duke senior i like him very well
touchstone god ild you sir i desire you of the like i
 press in here sir amongst the rest of the country
 copulatives to swear and to forswear according as
 marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin
 sir an illfavoured thing sir but mine own a poor
 humour of mine sir to take that that no man else
 will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a
 poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster
duke senior by my faith he is very swift and sententious
touchstone according to the fool's bolt sir and such dulcet diseases
jaques but for the seventh cause how did you find the
 quarrel on the seventh cause
touchstone upon a lie seven times removedbear your body more
 seeming audreyas thus sir i did dislike the
 cut of a certain courtier's beard he sent me word
 if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the
 mind it was this is called the retort courteous
 if i sent him word again it was not well cut he
 would send me word he cut it to please himself
 this is called the quip modest if again it was
 not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
 called the reply churlish if again it was not
 well cut he would answer i spake not true this
 is called the reproof valiant if again it was not
 well cut he would say i lied this is called the
 countercheque quarrelsome and so to the lie
 circumstantial and the lie direct
jaques and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
touchstone i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial
 nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we
 measured swords and parted
jaques can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie
touchstone o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
 books for good manners i will name you the degrees
 the first the retort courteous the second the
 quip modest the third the reply churlish the
 fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the
 countercheque quarrelsome the sixth the lie with
 circumstance the seventh the lie direct all
 these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may
 avoid that too with an if i knew when seven
 justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
 parties were met themselves one of them thought but
 of an if as if you said so then i said so and
 they shook hands and swore brothers your if is the
 only peacemaker much virtue in if
jaques is not this a rare fellow my lord he's as good at
 any thing and yet a fool

 the presentation of that he shoots his wit

 enter jaques de boys
jaques de boys let me have audience for a word or two
 i am the second son of old sir rowland
 that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
 duke frederick hearing how that every day
 men of great worth resorted to this forest
 address'd a mighty power which were on foot
 in his own conduct purposely to take
 his brother here and put him to the sword
 and to the skirts of this wild wood he came
 where meeting with an old religious man
 after some question with him was converted
 both from his enterprise and from the world
 his crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother
 and all their lands restored to them again
 that were with him exiled this to be true
 i do engage my life
duke senior welcome young man
 thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers wedding
 to one his lands withheld and to the other
 a land itself at large a potent dukedom
 first in this forest let us do those ends
 that here were well begun and well begot
 and after every of this happy number
 that have endured shrewd days and nights with us
 shall share the good of our returned fortune
 according to the measure of their states
 meantime forget this newfall'n dignity
 and fall into our rustic revelry
 play music and you brides and bridegrooms all
 with measure heap'd in joy to the measures fall
jaques sir by your patience if i heard you rightly
 the duke hath put on a religious life
 and thrown into neglect the pompous court
jaques de boys he hath
jaques to him will i out of these convertites
 there is much matter to be heard and learn'd
 to duke senior
 you to your former honour i bequeath
 your patience and your virtue well deserves it
 to orlando
 you to a love that your true faith doth merit
 to oliver
 you to your land and love and great allies

 as we do trust they'll end in true delights

 epilogue
rosalind it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue
 but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
 the prologue if it be true that good wine needs
 no bush tis true that a good play needs no
 epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes
 and good plays prove the better by the help of good
 epilogues what a case am i in then that am
 neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
 you in the behalf of a good play i am not
 furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not
 become me my way is to conjure you and i'll begin
 with the women i charge you o women for the love
 you bear to men to like as much of this play as
 please you and i charge you o men for the love
 you bear to womenas i perceive by your simpering
 none of you hates themthat between you and the
 women the play may please if i were a woman i
 would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
 me complexions that liked me and breaths that i
 defied not and i am sure as many as have good
 beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my
 kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell

 and by the doom of death end woes and all
duke solinus merchant of syracuse plead no more
 i am not partial to infringe our laws
 the enmity and discord which of late
 sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
 to merchants our welldealing countrymen
 who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
 have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods
 excludes all pity from our threatening looks
 for since the mortal and intestine jars
 twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
 it hath in solemn synods been decreed
 both by the syracusians and ourselves
 to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more
 if any born at ephesus be seen
 at any syracusian marts and fairs
 again if any syracusian born
 come to the bay of ephesus he dies
 his goods confiscate to the duke's dispose
 unless a thousand marks be levied
 to quit the penalty and to ransom him
 thy substance valued at the highest rate
 cannot amount unto a hundred marks
 therefore by law thou art condemned to die
aegeon yet this my comfort when your words are done
 my woes end likewise with the evening sun
duke solinus well syracusian say in brief the cause
 why thou departed'st from thy native home
 and for what cause thou camest to ephesus
aegeon a heavier task could not have been imposed
 than i to speak my griefs unspeakable
 yet that the world may witness that my end
 was wrought by nature not by vile offence
 i'll utter what my sorrows give me leave
 in syracusa was i born and wed
 unto a woman happy but for me
 and by me had not our hap been bad
 with her i lived in joy our wealth increased
 by prosperous voyages i often made
 to epidamnum till my factor's death
 and the great care of goods at random left
 drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
 from whom my absence was not six months old
 before herself almost at fainting under
 the pleasing punishment that women bear
 had made provision for her following me
 and soon and safe arrived where i was
 there had she not been long but she became
 a joyful mother of two goodly sons
 and which was strange the one so like the other
 as could not be distinguish'd but by names
 that very hour and in the selfsame inn
 a meaner woman was delivered
 of such a burden male twins both alike
 thosefor their parents were exceeding poor
 i bought and brought up to attend my sons
 my wife not meanly proud of two such boys
 made daily motions for our home return
 unwilling i agreed alas too soon
 we came aboard
 a league from epidamnum had we sail'd
 before the always windobeying deep
 gave any tragic instance of our harm
 but longer did we not retain much hope
 for what obscured light the heavens did grant
 did but convey unto our fearful minds
 a doubtful warrant of immediate death
 which though myself would gladly have embraced
 yet the incessant weepings of my wife
 weeping before for what she saw must come
 and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
 that mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear
 forced me to seek delays for them and me
 and this it was for other means was none
 the sailors sought for safety by our boat
 and left the ship then sinkingripe to us
 my wife more careful for the latterborn
 had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast
 such as seafaring men provide for storms
 to him one of the other twins was bound
 whilst i had been like heedful of the other
 the children thus disposed my wife and i
 fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd
 fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast
 and floating straight obedient to the stream
 was carried towards corinth as we thought
 at length the sun gazing upon the earth
 dispersed those vapours that offended us
 and by the benefit of his wished light
 the seas wax'd calm and we discovered
 two ships from far making amain to us
 of corinth that of epidaurus this
 but ere they cameo let me say no more
 gather the sequel by that went before
duke solinus nay forward old man do not break off so
 for we may pity though not pardon thee
aegeon o had the gods done so i had not now
 worthily term'd them merciless to us
 for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
 we were encounterd by a mighty rock
 which being violently borne upon
 our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
 so that in this unjust divorce of us
 fortune had left to both of us alike
 what to delight in what to sorrow for
 her part poor soul seeming as burdened
 with lesser weight but not with lesser woe
 was carried with more speed before the wind
 and in our sight they three were taken up
 by fishermen of corinth as we thought
 at length another ship had seized on us
 and knowing whom it was their hap to save
 gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests
 and would have reft the fishers of their prey
 had not their bark been very slow of sail
 and therefore homeward did they bend their course
 thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss
 that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd
 to tell sad stories of my own mishaps
duke solinus and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
 do me the favour to dilate at full
 what hath befall'n of them and thee till now
aegeon my youngest boy and yet my eldest care
 at eighteen years became inquisitive
 after his brother and importuned me
 that his attendantso his case was like
 reft of his brother but retain'd his name
 might bear him company in the quest of him
 whom whilst i labour'd of a love to see
 i hazarded the loss of whom i loved
 five summers have i spent in furthest greece
 roaming clean through the bounds of asia
 and coasting homeward came to ephesus
 hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
 or that or any place that harbours men
 but here must end the story of my life
 and happy were i in my timely death
 could all my travels warrant me they live
duke solinus hapless aegeon whom the fates have mark'd
 to bear the extremity of dire mishap
 now trust me were it not against our laws
 against my crown my oath my dignity
 which princes would they may not disannul
 my soul would sue as advocate for thee
 but though thou art adjudged to the death
 and passed sentence may not be recall'd
 but to our honour's great disparagement
 yet i will favour thee in what i can
 therefore merchant i'll limit thee this day
 to seek thy life by beneficial help
 try all the friends thou hast in ephesus
 beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
 and live if no then thou art doom'd to die
 gaoler take him to thy custody
gaoler i will my lord

 according to the statute of the town
 dies ere the weary sun set in the west
 there is your money that i had to keep
antipholus
of syracuse go bear it to the centaur where we host
 and stay there dromio till i come to thee
 within this hour it will be dinnertime

dromio of syracuse many a man would take you at your word
 and go indeed having so good a mean
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse a trusty villain sir that very oft
 when i am dull with care and melancholy
 lightens my humour with his merry jests

first merchant i am invited sir to certain merchants
 of whom i hope to make much benefit
 i crave your pardon soon at five o'clock
 please you i'll meet with you upon the mart
 and afterward consort you till bedtime
 my present business calls me from you now
antipholus
of syracuse farewell till then i will go lose myself
 and wander up and down to view the city
first merchant sir i commend you to your own content
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse he that commends me to mine own content
 commends me to the thing i cannot get
 i to the world am like a drop of water
 that in the ocean seeks another drop
 who falling there to find his fellow forth
 unseen inquisitive confounds himself
 so i to find a mother and a brother
 in quest of them unhappy lose myself
 enter dromio of ephesus
 here comes the almanac of my true date
 what now how chance thou art return'd so soon
dromio of ephesus return'd so soon rather approach'd too late
 the capon burns the pig falls from the spit
 the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell
 my mistress made it one upon my cheek
 she is so hot because the meat is cold
 the meat is cold because you come not home
 you come not home because you have no stomach
 you have no stomach having broke your fast
 but we that know what tis to fast and pray
 are penitent for your default today
antipholus
of syracuse stop in your wind sir tell me this i pray
 where have you left the money that i gave you
dromio of ephesus osixpence that i had o wednesday last
 to pay the saddler for my mistress crupper
 the saddler had it sir i kept it not
antipholus
of syracuse i am not in a sportive humour now

 we being strangers here how darest thou trust
 so great a charge from thine own custody
dromio of ephesus i pray you air as you sit at dinner
 i from my mistress come to you in post
 if i return i shall be post indeed
 for she will score your fault upon my pate
 methinks your maw like mine should be your clock
 and strike you home without a messenger
antipholus
of syracuse come dromio come these jests are out of season
 reserve them till a merrier hour than this
 where is the gold i gave in charge to thee
dromio of ephesus to me sir why you gave no gold to me
antipholus

 and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge
dromio of ephesus my charge was but to fetch you from the mart
 home to your house the phoenix sir to dinner
 my mistress and her sister stays for you
antipholus
of syracuse in what safe place you have bestow'd my money
 or i shall break that merry sconce of yours
 that stands on tricks when i am undisposed
 where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me
dromio of ephesus i have some marks of yours upon my pate
 some of my mistress marks upon my shoulders
 but not a thousand marks between you both
 if i should pay your worship those again
 perchance you will not bear them patiently
antipholus
of syracuse thy mistress marks what mistress slave hast thou
dromio of ephesus your worship's wife my mistress at the phoenix

dromio of ephesus what mean you sir for god's sake hold your hands
 nay and you will not sir i'll take my heels
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse upon my life by some device or other
 the villain is o'erraught of all my money
 they say this town is full of cozenage
 as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye
 darkworking sorcerers that change the mind
 soulkilling witches that deform the body
 disguised cheaters prating mountebanks
 and many suchlike liberties of sin
 if it prove so i will be gone the sooner
 i'll to the centaur to go seek this slave
 i greatly fear my money is not safe

act ii
scene i the house of antipholus of ephesus
 enter adriana and luciana
adriana neither my husband nor the slave return'd
 that in such haste i sent to seek his master
 sure luciana it is two o'clock
luciana perhaps some merchant hath invited him
 and from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner
 good sister let us dine and never fret
 a man is master of his liberty
 time is their master and when they see time
 they'll go or come if so be patient sister
adriana why should their liberty than ours be more
luciana because their business still lies out o door
adriana look when i serve him so he takes it ill
luciana o know he is the bridle of your will
adriana there's none but asses will be bridled so
luciana why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe
 there's nothing situate under heaven's eye
 but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
 the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
 are their males subjects and at their controls
 men more divine the masters of all these
 lords of the wide world and wild watery seas
 indued with intellectual sense and souls
 of more preeminence than fish and fowls
 are masters to their females and their lords
 then let your will attend on their accords
adriana this servitude makes you to keep unwed
luciana not this but troubles of the marriagebed
adriana but were you wedded you would bear some sway
luciana ere i learn love i'll practise to obey
adriana how if your husband start some other where
luciana till he come home again i would forbear
adriana patience unmoved no marvel though she pause
 they can be meek that have no other cause
 a wretched soul bruised with adversity
 we bid be quiet when we hear it cry
 but were we burdened with like weight of pain
 as much or more would we ourselves complain
 so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
 with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me
 but if thou live to see like right bereft
 this foolbegg'd patience in thee will be left
luciana well i will marry one day but to try
 here comes your man now is your husband nigh
 enter dromio of ephesus
adriana say is your tardy master now at hand
dromio of ephesus nay he's at two hands with me and that my two ears
 can witness
adriana say didst thou speak with him know'st thou his mind
dromio of ephesus ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
 beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it
luciana spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning
dromio of ephesus nay he struck so plainly i could too well feel his
 blows and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce
 understand them
adriana but say i prithee is he coming home it seems he
 hath great care to please his wife
dromio of ephesus why mistress sure my master is hornmad
adriana hornmad thou villain
dromio of ephesus i mean not cuckoldmad
 but sure he is stark mad
 when i desired him to come home to dinner
 he ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold
 'tis dinnertime quoth i my gold quoth he
 your meat doth burn quoth i my gold quoth he
 will you come home quoth i my gold quoth he
 where is the thousand marks i gave thee villain'
 the pig quoth i is burn'd my gold quoth he
 my mistress sir quoth i hang up thy mistress
 i know not thy mistress out on thy mistress'
luciana quoth who
dromio of ephesus quoth my master
 i know quoth he no house no wife no mistress'
 so that my errand due unto my tongue
 i thank him i bare home upon my shoulders
 for in conclusion he did beat me there
adriana go back again thou slave and fetch him home
dromio of ephesus go back again and be new beaten home
 for god's sake send some other messenger
adriana back slave or i will break thy pate across
dromio of ephesus and he will bless that cross with other beating
 between you i shall have a holy head
adriana hence prating peasant fetch thy master home
dromio of ephesus am i so round with you as you with me
 that like a football you do spurn me thus
 you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
 if i last in this service you must case me in leather
 exit
luciana fie how impatience loureth in your face
adriana his company must do his minions grace
 whilst i at home starve for a merry look
 hath homely age the alluring beauty took
 from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
 are my discourses dull barren my wit
 if voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd
 unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
 do their gay vestments his affections bait
 that's not my fault he's master of my state
 what ruins are in me that can be found
 by him not ruin'd then is he the ground
 of my defeatures my decayed fair
 a sunny look of his would soon repair
 but too unruly deer he breaks the pale
 and feeds from home poor i am but his stale
luciana selfharming jealousy fie beat it hence
adriana unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
 i know his eye doth homage otherwhere
 or else what lets it but he would be here
 sister you know he promised me a chain
 would that alone alone he would detain
 so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
 i see the jewel best enamelled
 will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
 that others touch and often touching will
 wear gold and no man that hath a name
 by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
 since that my beauty cannot please his eye
 i'll weep what's left away and weeping die
luciana how many fond fools serve mad jealousy

antipholus
of syracuse the gold i gave to dromio is laid up
 safe at the centaur and the heedful slave
 is wander'd forth in care to seek me out
 by computation and mine host's report
 i could not speak with dromio since at first
 i sent him from the mart see here he comes
 enter dromio of syracuse
 how now sir is your merry humour alter'd
 as you love strokes so jest with me again
 you know no centaur you received no gold
 your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
 my house was at the phoenix wast thou mad
 that thus so madly thou didst answer me
dromio of syracuse what answer sir when spake i such a word
antipholus
of syracuse even now even here not half an hour since
dromio of syracuse i did not see you since you sent me hence
 home to the centaur with the gold you gave me
antipholus
of syracuse villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt
 and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner
 for which i hope thou felt'st i was displeased
dromio of syracuse i am glad to see you in this merry vein
 what means this jest i pray you master tell me
antipholus
of syracuse yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
 think'st thou i jest hold take thou that and that
 beating him
dromio of syracuse hold sir for god's sake now your jest is earnest
 upon what bargain do you give it me
antipholus
of syracuse because that i familiarly sometimes
 do use you for my fool and chat with you
 your sauciness will jest upon my love
 and make a common of my serious hours
 when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
 but creep in crannies when he hides his beams
 if you will jest with me know my aspect
 and fashion your demeanor to my looks
 or i will beat this method in your sconce
dromio of syracuse sconce call you it so you would leave battering i
 had rather have it a head an you use these blows
 long i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
 it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders
 but i pray sir why am i beaten
antipholus
of syracuse dost thou not know
dromio of syracuse nothing sir but that i am beaten
antipholus
of syracuse shall i tell you why
dromio of syracuse ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath
 a wherefore
antipholus
of syracuse why firstfor flouting me and then wherefore
 for urging it the second time to me
dromio of syracuse was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
 when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
 nor reason
 well sir i thank you
antipholus
of syracuse thank me sir for what
dromio of syracuse marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing
antipholus
of syracuse i'll make you amends next to give you nothing for
 something but say sir is it dinnertime
dromio of syracuse no sir i think the meat wants that i have
antipholus
of syracuse in good time sir what's that
dromio of syracuse basting
antipholus
of syracuse well sir then twill be dry
dromio of syracuse if it be sir i pray you eat none of it
antipholus
of syracuse your reason
dromio of syracuse lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
 dry basting
antipholus
of syracuse well sir learn to jest in good time there's a
 time for all things
dromio of syracuse i durst have denied that before you were so choleric
antipholus
of syracuse by what rule sir
dromio of syracuse marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald
 pate of father time himself
antipholus
of syracuse let's hear it
dromio of syracuse there's no time for a man to recover his hair that
 grows bald by nature
antipholus
of syracuse may he not do it by fine and recovery
dromio of syracuse yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
 lost hair of another man
antipholus
of syracuse why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is
 so plentiful an excrement
dromio of syracuse because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts
 and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit
antipholus
of syracuse why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit
dromio of syracuse not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair
antipholus
of syracuse why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit
dromio of syracuse the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth
 it in a kind of jollity
antipholus
of syracuse for what reason
dromio of syracuse for two and sound ones too
antipholus
of syracuse nay not sound i pray you
dromio of syracuse sure ones then
antipholus
of syracuse nay not sure in a thing falsing
dromio of syracuse certain ones then
antipholus
of syracuse name them
dromio of syracuse the one to save the money that he spends in
 trimming the other that at dinner they should not
 drop in his porridge
antipholus
of syracuse you would all this time have proved there is no
 time for all things
dromio of syracuse marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair
 lost by nature
antipholus
of syracuse but your reason was not substantial why there is no
 time to recover
dromio of syracuse thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore
 to the world's end will have bald followers
antipholus
of syracuse i knew twould be a bald conclusion
 but soft who wafts us yonder
 enter adriana and luciana
adriana ay ay antipholus look strange and frown
 some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
 i am not adriana nor thy wife
 the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
 that never words were music to thine ear
 that never object pleasing in thine eye
 that never touch well welcome to thy hand
 that never meat sweetsavor'd in thy taste
 unless i spake or look'd or touch'd or carved to thee
 how comes it now my husband o how comes it
 that thou art thus estranged from thyself
 thyself i call it being strange to me
 that undividable incorporate
 am better than thy dear self's better part
 ah do not tear away thyself from me
 for know my love as easy mayest thou fall
 a drop of water in the breaking gulf
 and take unmingled that same drop again
 without addition or diminishing
 as take from me thyself and not me too
 how dearly would it touch me to the quick
 shouldst thou but hear i were licentious
 and that this body consecrate to thee
 by ruffian lust should be contaminate
 wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
 and hurl the name of husband in my face
 and tear the stain'd skin off my harlotbrow
 and from my false hand cut the weddingring
 and break it with a deepdivorcing vow
 i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
 i am possess'd with an adulterate blot
 my blood is mingled with the crime of lust
 for if we too be one and thou play false
 i do digest the poison of thy flesh
 being strumpeted by thy contagion
 keep then far league and truce with thy true bed
 i live unstain'd thou undishonoured
antipholus
of syracuse plead you to me fair dame i know you not
 in ephesus i am but two hours old
 as strange unto your town as to your talk
 who every word by all my wit being scann'd
 want wit in all one word to understand
luciana fie brother how the world is changed with you
 when were you wont to use my sister thus
 she sent for you by dromio home to dinner
antipholus
of syracuse by dromio
dromio of syracuse by me
adriana by thee and this thou didst return from him
 that he did buffet thee and in his blows
 denied my house for his me for his wife
antipholus
of syracuse did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
 what is the course and drift of your compact
dromio of syracuse i sir i never saw her till this time
antipholus
of syracuse villain thou liest for even her very words
 didst thou deliver to me on the mart
dromio of syracuse i never spake with her in all my life
antipholus
of syracuse how can she thus then call us by our names
 unless it be by inspiration
adriana how ill agrees it with your gravity
 to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
 abetting him to thwart me in my mood
 be it my wrong you are from me exempt
 but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
 come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine
 thou art an elm my husband i a vine
 whose weakness married to thy stronger state
 makes me with thy strength to communicate
 if aught possess thee from me it is dross
 usurping ivy brier or idle moss
 who all for want of pruning with intrusion
 infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
antipholus
of syracuse to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
 what was i married to her in my dream
 or sleep i now and think i hear all this
 what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
 until i know this sure uncertainty
 i'll entertain the offer'd fallacy
luciana dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
dromio of syracuse o for my beads i cross me for a sinner
 this is the fairy land o spite of spites
 we talk with goblins owls and sprites
 if we obey them not this will ensue
 they'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue
luciana why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not
 dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot
dromio of syracuse i am transformed master am i not
antipholus
of syracuse i think thou art in mind and so am i
dromio of syracuse nay master both in mind and in my shape
antipholus
of syracuse thou hast thine own form
dromio of syracuse no i am an ape
luciana if thou art changed to aught tis to an ass
dromio of syracuse tis true she rides me and i long for grass
 tis so i am an ass else it could never be
 but i should know her as well as she knows me
adriana come come no longer will i be a fool
 to put the finger in the eye and weep
 whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn
 come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate
 husband i'll dine above with you today
 and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
 sirrah if any ask you for your master
 say he dines forth and let no creature enter
 come sister dromio play the porter well
antipholus
of syracuse am i in earth in heaven or in hell
 sleeping or waking mad or welladvised
 known unto these and to myself disguised
 i'll say as they say and persever so
 and in this mist at all adventures go
dromio of syracuse master shall i be porter at the gate
adriana ay and let none enter lest i break your pate

 why at this time the doors are made against you

 and let us to the tiger all to dinner
 and about evening come yourself alone
 to know the reason of this strange restraint
 if by strong hand you offer to break in
 now in the stirring passage of the day
 a vulgar comment will be made of it
 and that supposed by the common rout
 against your yet ungalled estimation
 that may with foul intrusion enter in
 and dwell upon your grave when you are dead
 for slander lives upon succession
 for ever housed where it gets possession
antipholus
of ephesus you have prevailed i will depart in quiet
 and in despite of mirth mean to be merry

luciana and may it be that you have quite forgot
 a husband's office shall antipholus
 even in the spring of love thy lovesprings rot
 shall love in building grow so ruinous
 if you did wed my sister for her wealth
 then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness
 or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
 muffle your false love with some show of blindness
 let not my sister read it in your eye
 be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator
 look sweet be fair become disloyalty
 apparel vice like virtue's harbinger
 bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
 teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
 be secretfalse what need she be acquainted
 what simple thief brags of his own attaint
 tis double wrong to truant with your bed
 and let her read it in thy looks at board
 shame hath a bastard fame well managed
 ill deeds are doubled with an evil word
 alas poor women make us but believe
 being compact of credit that you love us
 though others have the arm show us the sleeve
 we in your motion turn and you may move us
 then gentle brother get you in again
 comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
 tis holy sport to be a little vain
 when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
antipholus
of syracuse sweet mistresswhat your name is else i know not
 nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
 less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
 than our earth's wonder more than earth divine
 teach me dear creature how to think and speak
 lay open to my earthygross conceit
 smother'd in errors feeble shallow weak
 the folded meaning of your words deceit
 against my soul's pure truth why labour you
 to make it wander in an unknown field
 are you a god would you create me new
 transform me then and to your power i'll yield
 but if that i am i then well i know
 your weeping sister is no wife of mine
 nor to her bed no homage do i owe
 far more far more to you do i decline
 o train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
 to drown me in thy sister's flood of tears
 sing siren for thyself and i will dote
 spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs
 and as a bed i'll take them and there lie
 and in that glorious supposition think
 he gains by death that hath such means to die
 let love being light be drowned if she sink
luciana what are you mad that you do reason so
antipholus
of syracuse not mad but mated how i do not know

 is a mad tale he told today at dinner
 of his own doors being shut against his entrance
 belike his wife acquainted with his fits
 on purpose shut the doors against his way
 my way is now to hie home to his house
 and tell his wife that being lunatic
 he rush'd into my house and took perforce

second merchant i dare and do defy thee for a villain
 they draw
 enter adriana luciana the courtezan and others
adriana hold hurt him not for god's sake he is mad
 some get within him take his sword away
 bind dromio too and bear them to my house
dromio of syracuse run master run for god's sake take a house
 this is some priory in or we are spoil'd
 exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
 to the priory
 enter the lady abbess aemilia
aemelia be quiet people wherefore throng you hither
adriana to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
 let us come in that we may bind him fast
 and bear him home for his recovery
angelo i knew he was not in his perfect wits
second merchant i am sorry now that i did draw on him
aemelia how long hath this possession held the man
adriana this week he hath been heavy sour sad
 and much different from the man he was
 but till this afternoon his passion
 ne'er brake into extremity of rage
aemelia hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
 buried some dear friend hath not else his eye
 stray'd his affection in unlawful love
 a sin prevailing much in youthful men
 who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
 which of these sorrows is he subject to
adriana to none of these except it be the last
 namely some love that drew him oft from home
aemelia you should for that have reprehended him
adriana why so i did
aemelia ay but not rough enough
adriana as roughly as my modesty would let me
aemelia haply in private
adriana and in assemblies too
aemelia ay but not enough
adriana it was the copy of our conference
 in bed he slept not for my urging it
 at board he fed not for my urging it
 alone it was the subject of my theme
 in company i often glanced it
 still did i tell him it was vile and bad
aemelia and thereof came it that the man was mad
 the venom clamours of a jealous woman
 poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth
 it seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing
 and therefore comes it that his head is light
 thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
 unquiet meals make ill digestions
 thereof the raging fire of fever bred
 and what's a fever but a fit of madness
 thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls
 sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue
 but moody and dull melancholy
 kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
 and at her heels a huge infectious troop
 of pale distemperatures and foes to life
 in food in sport and lifepreserving rest
 to be disturb'd would mad or man or beast
 the consequence is then thy jealous fits
 have scared thy husband from the use of wits
luciana she never reprehended him but mildly
 when he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly
 why bear you these rebukes and answer not
adriana she did betray me to my own reproof
 good people enter and lay hold on him
aemelia no not a creature enters in my house
adriana then let your servants bring my husband forth
aemelia neither he took this place for sanctuary
 and it shall privilege him from your hands
 till i have brought him to his wits again
 or lose my labour in assaying it
adriana i will attend my husband be his nurse
 diet his sickness for it is my office
 and will have no attorney but myself
 and therefore let me have him home with me
aemelia be patient for i will not let him stir
 till i have used the approved means i have
 with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
 to make of him a formal man again
 it is a branch and parcel of mine oath
 a charitable duty of my order
 therefore depart and leave him here with me
adriana i will not hence and leave my husband here
 and ill it doth beseem your holiness
 to separate the husband and the wife
aemelia be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
 exit
luciana complain unto the duke of this indignity
adriana come go i will fall prostrate at his feet
 and never rise until my tears and prayers
 have won his grace to come in person hither
 and take perforce my husband from the abbess
second merchant by this i think the dial points at five
 anon i'm sure the duke himself in person
 comes this way to the melancholy vale
 the place of death and sorry execution
 behind the ditches of the abbey here
angelo upon what cause
second merchant to see a reverend syracusian merchant
 who put unluckily into this bay
 against the laws and statutes of this town
 beheaded publicly for his offence
angelo see where they come we will behold his death
luciana kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
 enter duke solinus attended aegeon bareheaded with the
 headsman and other officers
duke solinus yet once again proclaim it publicly
 if any friend will pay the sum for him
 he shall not die so much we tender him
adriana justice most sacred duke against the abbess
duke solinus she is a virtuous and a reverend lady
 it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
adriana may it please your grace antipholus my husband
 whom i made lord of me and all i had
 at your important lettersthis ill day
 a most outrageous fit of madness took him
 that desperately he hurried through the street
 with him his bondman all as mad as he
 doing displeasure to the citizens
 by rushing in their houses bearing thence
 rings jewels any thing his rage did like
 once did i get him bound and sent him home
 whilst to take order for the wrongs i went
 that here and there his fury had committed
 anon i wot not by what strong escape
 he broke from those that had the guard of him
 and with his mad attendant and himself
 each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
 met us again and madly bent on us
 chased us away till raising of more aid
 we came again to bind them then they fled
 into this abbey whither we pursued them
 and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
 and will not suffer us to fetch him out
 nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
 therefore most gracious duke with thy command
 let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
duke solinus long since thy husband served me in my wars
 and i to thee engaged a prince's word
 when thou didst make him master of thy bed
 to do him all the grace and good i could
 go some of you knock at the abbeygate
 and bid the lady abbess come to me
 i will determine this before i stir
 enter a servant
servant o mistress mistress shift and save yourself
 my master and his man are both broke loose
 beaten the maids arow and bound the doctor
 whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire
 and ever as it blazed they threw on him
 great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
 my master preaches patience to him and the while
 his man with scissors nicks him like a fool
 and sure unless you send some present help
 between them they will kill the conjurer
adriana peace fool thy master and his man are here
 and that is false thou dost report to us
servant mistress upon my life i tell you true
 i have not breathed almost since i did see it
 he cries for you and vows if he can take you
 to scorch your face and to disfigure you
 cry within
 hark hark i hear him mistress fly be gone
duke solinus come stand by me fear nothing guard with halberds
adriana ay me it is my husband witness you
 that he is borne about invisible
 even now we housed him in the abbey here
 and now he's there past thought of human reason
 enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus
antipholus
of ephesus justice most gracious duke o grant me justice
 even for the service that long since i did thee
 when i bestrid thee in the wars and took
 deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
 that then i lost for thee now grant me justice
aegeon unless the fear of death doth make me dote
 i see my son antipholus and dromio
antipholus
of ephesus justice sweet prince against that woman there
 she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife
 that hath abused and dishonour'd me
 even in the strength and height of injury
 beyond imagination is the wrong
 that she this day hath shameless thrown on me
duke solinus discover how and thou shalt find me just
antipholus
of ephesus this day great duke she shut the doors upon me
 while she with harlots feasted in my house
duke solinus a grievous fault say woman didst thou so
adriana no my good lord myself he and my sister
 today did dine together so befall my soul
 as this is false he burdens me withal
luciana ne'er may i look on day nor sleep on night
 but she tells to your highness simple truth
angelo o perjured woman they are both forsworn
 in this the madman justly chargeth them
antipholus
of ephesus my liege i am advised what i say
 neither disturbed with the effect of wine
 nor headyrash provoked with raging ire
 albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
 this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner
 that goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her
 could witness it for he was with me then
 who parted with me to go fetch a chain
 promising to bring it to the porpentine
 where balthazar and i did dine together
 our dinner done and he not coming thither
 i went to seek him in the street i met him
 and in his company that gentleman
 there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
 that i this day of him received the chain
 which god he knows i saw not for the which
 he did arrest me with an officer
 i did obey and sent my peasant home
 for certain ducats he with none return'd
 then fairly i bespoke the officer
 to go in person with me to my house
 by the way we met
 my wife her sister and a rabble more
 of vile confederates along with them
 they brought one pinch a hungry leanfaced villain
 a mere anatomy a mountebank
 a threadbare juggler and a fortuneteller
 a needy holloweyed sharplooking wretch
 a deadlooking man this pernicious slave
 forsooth took on him as a conjurer
 and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
 and with no face as twere outfacing me
 cries out i was possess'd then all together
 they fell upon me bound me bore me thence
 and in a dark and dankish vault at home
 there left me and my man both bound together
 till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
 i gain'd my freedom and immediately
 ran hither to your grace whom i beseech
 to give me ample satisfaction
 for these deep shames and great indignities
angelo my lord in truth thus far i witness with him
 that he dined not at home but was lock'd out
duke solinus but had he such a chain of thee or no
angelo he had my lord and when he ran in here
 these people saw the chain about his neck
second merchant besides i will be sworn these ears of mine
 heard you confess you had the chain of him
 after you first forswore it on the mart
 and thereupon i drew my sword on you
 and then you fled into this abbey here
 from whence i think you are come by miracle
antipholus
of ephesus i never came within these abbeywalls
 nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
 i never saw the chain so help me heaven
 and this is false you burden me withal
duke solinus why what an intricate impeach is this
 i think you all have drunk of circe's cup
 if here you housed him here he would have been
 if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
 you say he dined at home the goldsmith here
 denies that saying sirrah what say you
dromio of ephesus sir he dined with her there at the porpentine
courtezan he did and from my finger snatch'd that ring
antipholus
of ephesus tis true my liege this ring i had of her
duke solinus saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here
courtezan as sure my liege as i do see your grace
duke solinus why this is strange go call the abbess hither
 i think you are all mated or stark mad
 exit one to abbess
aegeon most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
 haply i see a friend will save my life
 and pay the sum that may deliver me
duke solinus speak freely syracusian what thou wilt
aegeon is not your name sir call'd antipholus
 and is not that your bondman dromio
dromio of ephesus within this hour i was his bondman sir
 but he i thank him gnaw'd in two my cords
 now am i dromio and his man unbound
aegeon i am sure you both of you remember me
dromio of ephesus ourselves we do remember sir by you
 for lately we were bound as you are now
 you are not pinch's patient are you sir
aegeon why look you strange on me you know me well
antipholus i never saw you in my life till now
aegeon o grief hath changed me since you saw me last
 and careful hours with time's deformed hand
 have written strange defeatures in my face
 but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
antipholus
of ephesus neither
aegeon dromio nor thou
dromio of ephesus no trust me sir nor i
aegeon i am sure thou dost
dromio of ephesus ay sir but i am sure i do not and whatsoever a
 man denies you are now bound to believe him
aegeon not know my voice o time's extremity
 hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
 in seven short years that here my only son
 knows not my feeble key of untuned cares
 though now this grained face of mine be hid
 in sapconsuming winter's drizzled snow
 and all the conduits of my blood froze up
 yet hath my night of life some memory
 my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
 my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
 all these old witnessesi cannot err
 tell me thou art my son antipholus
antipholus
of ephesus i never saw my father in my life
aegeon but seven years since in syracusa boy
 thou know'st we parted but perhaps my son
 thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery
antipholus
of ephesus the duke and all that know me in the city
 can witness with me that it is not so
 i ne'er saw syracusa in my life
duke solinus i tell thee syracusian twenty years
 have i been patron to antipholus
 during which time he ne'er saw syracusa
 i see thy age and dangers make thee dote
 reenter aemilia with antipholus of syracuse and
 dromio of syracuse
aemelia most mighty duke behold a man much wrong'd
 all gather to see them
adriana i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me
duke solinus one of these men is genius to the other
 and so of these which is the natural man
 and which the spirit who deciphers them
dromio of syracuse i sir am dromio command him away
dromio of ephesus i sir am dromio pray let me stay
antipholus
of syracuse aegeon art thou not or else his ghost
dromio of syracuse o my old master who hath bound him here
aemelia whoever bound him i will loose his bonds
 and gain a husband by his liberty
 speak old aegeon if thou be'st the man
 that hadst a wife once call'd aemilia
 that bore thee at a burden two fair sons
 o if thou be'st the same aegeon speak
 and speak unto the same aemilia
aegeon if i dream not thou art aemilia
 if thou art she tell me where is that son
 that floated with thee on the fatal raft
aemelia by men of epidamnum he and i
 and the twin dromio all were taken up
 but by and by rude fishermen of corinth
 by force took dromio and my son from them
 and me they left with those of epidamnum
 what then became of them i cannot tell
 i to this fortune that you see me in
duke solinus why here begins his morning story right
 these two antipholuses these two so like
 and these two dromios one in semblance
 besides her urging of her wreck at sea
 these are the parents to these children
 which accidentally are met together
 antipholus thou camest from corinth first
antipholus
of syracuse no sir not i i came from syracuse
duke solinus stay stand apart i know not which is which
antipholus
of ephesus i came from corinth my most gracious lord

angelo that is the chain sir which you had of me
antipholus
of syracuse i think it be sir i deny it not
antipholus
of ephesus and you sir for this chain arrested me
angelo i think i did sir i deny it not
adriana i sent you money sir to be your bail
 by dromio but i think he brought it not
dromio of ephesus no none by me
antipholus
of syracuse this purse of ducats i received from you
 and dromio my man did bring them me
 i see we still did meet each other's man
 and i was ta'en for him and he for me
 and thereupon these errors are arose
antipholus
of ephesus these ducats pawn i for my father here
duke solinus it shall not need thy father hath his life
courtezan sir i must have that diamond from you
antipholus
of ephesus there take it and much thanks for my good cheer

 to go with us into the abbey here

scene i britain the garden of cymbeline's palace
 enter two gentlemen
first gentleman you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods
 no more obey the heavens than our courtiers
 still seem as does the king
second gentleman but what's the matter
first gentleman his daughter and the heir of's kingdom whom
 he purposed to his wife's sole sona widow
 that late he marriedhath referr'd herself
 unto a poor but worthy gentleman she's wedded
 her husband banish'd she imprison'd all
 is outward sorrow though i think the king
 be touch'd at very heart
second gentleman none but the king
first gentleman he that hath lost her too so is the queen
 that most desired the match but not a courtier
 although they wear their faces to the bent
 of the king's look's hath a heart that is not
 glad at the thing they scowl at
second gentleman and why so
first gentleman he that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
 too bad for bad report and he that hath her
 i mean that married her alack good man
 and therefore banish'dis a creature such
 as to seek through the regions of the earth
 for one his like there would be something failing
 in him that should compare i do not think
 so fair an outward and such stuff within
 endows a man but he
second gentleman you speak him far
first gentleman i do extend him sir within himself
 crush him together rather than unfold
 his measure duly
second gentleman what's his name and birth
first gentleman i cannot delve him to the root his father
 was call'd sicilius who did join his honour
 against the romans with cassibelan
 but had his titles by tenantius whom
 he served with glory and admired success
 so gain'd the suraddition leonatus
 and had besides this gentleman in question
 two other sons who in the wars o the time
 died with their swords in hand for which
 their father
 then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
 that he quit being and his gentle lady
 big of this gentleman our theme deceased
 as he was born the king he takes the babe
 to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus
 breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber
 puts to him all the learnings that his time
 could make him the receiver of which he took
 as we do air fast as twas minister'd
 and in's spring became a harvest lived in court
 which rare it is to domost praised most loved
 a sample to the youngest to the more mature
 a glass that feated them and to the graver
 a child that guided dotards to his mistress
 for whom he now is banish'd her own price
 proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue
 by her election may be truly read
 what kind of man he is
second gentleman i honour him
 even out of your report but pray you tell me
 is she sole child to the king
first gentleman his only child
 he had two sons if this be worth your hearing
 mark it the eldest of them at three years old
 i the swathingclothes the other from their nursery
 were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge
 which way they went
second gentleman how long is this ago
first gentleman some twenty years
second gentleman that a king's children should be so convey'd
 so slackly guarded and the search so slow
 that could not trace them
first gentleman howsoe'er tis strange
 or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at
 yet is it true sir
second gentleman i do well believe you
first gentleman we must forbear here comes the gentleman
 the queen and princess
 exeunt

 of angry eyes not comforted to live
 but that there is this jewel in the world
 that i may see again
posthumus leonatus my queen my mistress
 o lady weep no more lest i give cause
 to be suspected of more tenderness
 than doth become a man i will remain
 the loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth
 my residence in rome at one philario's
 who to my father was a friend to me
 known but by letter thither write my queen
 and with mine eyes i'll drink the words you send
 though ink be made of gall
 reenter queen
queen be brief i pray you
 if the king come i shall incur i know not
 how much of his displeasure
 aside

 pays dear for my offences
 exit
posthumus leonatus should we be taking leave

imogen o blest that i might not i chose an eagle
 and did avoid a puttock

 a seat for baseness
imogen no i rather added

cloten if my shirt were bloody then to shift it have i hurt him
second lord aside no faith not so much as his patience
first lord hurt him his body's a passable carcass if he be
 not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel if it be not hurt
second lord aside his steel was in debt it went o the
 backside the town
cloten the villain would not stand me
second lord aside no but he fled forward still toward your face
first lord stand you you have land enough of your own but
 he added to your having gave you some ground
second lord aside as many inches as you have oceans puppies
cloten i would they had not come between us
second lord aside so would i till you had measured how long
 a fool you were upon the ground
cloten and that she should love this fellow and refuse me
second lord aside if it be a sin to make a true election she
 is damned
first lord sir as i told you always her beauty and her brain
 go not together she's a good sign but i have seen
 small reflection of her wit
second lord aside she shines not upon fools lest the
 reflection should hurt her
cloten come i'll to my chamber would there had been some
 hurt done
second lord aside i wish not so unless it had been the fall
 of an ass which is no great hurt
cloten you'll go with us

imogen senseless linen happier therein than i
 and that was all
pisanio no madam for so long
 as he could make me with this eye or ear
 distinguish him from others he did keep
 the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
 still waving as the fits and stirs of s mind
 could best express how slow his soul sail'd on
 how swift his ship
imogen thou shouldst have made him
 as little as a crow or less ere left
 to aftereye him
pisanio madam so i did
imogen i would have broke mine eyestrings crack'd them but
 to look upon him till the diminution
 of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
 nay follow'd him till he had melted from
 the smallness of a gnat to air and then
 have turn'd mine eye and wept but good pisanio
 when shall we hear from him
pisanio be assured madam
 with his next vantage
imogen i did not take my leave of him but had
 most pretty things to say ere i could tell him
 how i would think on him at certain hours
 such thoughts and such or i could make him swear
 the shes of italy should not betray
 mine interest and his honour or have charged him
 at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
 to encounter me with orisons for then
 i am in heaven for him or ere i could
 give him that parting kiss which i had set
 betwixt two charming words comes in my father
 and like the tyrannous breathing of the north
 shakes all our buds from growing

scene iv rome philario's house
 enter philario iachimo a frenchman a
 dutchman and a spaniard
iachimo believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was
 then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy
 as since he hath been allowed the name of but i
 could then have looked on him without the help of
 admiration though the catalogue of his endowments
 had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items
philario you speak of him when he was less furnished than now
 he is with that which makes him both without and within
frenchman i have seen him in france we had very many there
 could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
iachimo this matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein
 he must be weighed rather by her value than his own
 words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter
frenchman and then his banishment
iachimo ay and the approbation of those that weep this
 lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
 to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment
 which else an easy battery might lay flat for
 taking a beggar without less quality but how comes
 it he is to sojourn with you how creeps
 acquaintance
philario his father and i were soldiers together to whom i
 have been often bound for no less than my life
 here comes the briton let him be so entertained
 amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your
 knowing to a stranger of his quality
 enter posthumus leonatus
 i beseech you all be better known to this
 gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend
 of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear
 hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing
frenchman sir we have known together in orleans
posthumus leonatus since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies
 which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still
frenchman sir you o'errate my poor kindness i was glad i
 did atone my countryman and you it had been pity
 you should have been put together with so mortal a
 purpose as then each bore upon importance of so
 slight and trivial a nature
posthumus leonatus by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller
 rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in
 my every action to be guided by others experiences
 but upon my mended judgmentif i offend not to say
 it is mendedmy quarrel was not altogether slight
frenchman faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords
 and by such two that would by all likelihood have
 confounded one the other or have fallen both
iachimo can we with manners ask what was the difference
frenchman safely i think twas a contention in public
 which may without contradiction suffer the report
 it was much like an argument that fell out last
 night where each of us fell in praise of our
 country mistresses this gentleman at that time
 vouchingand upon warrant of bloody
 affirmationhis to be more fair virtuous wise
 chaste constantqualified and less attemptable
 than any the rarest of our ladies in france
iachimo that lady is not now living or this gentleman's
 opinion by this worn out
posthumus leonatus she holds her virtue still and i my mind
iachimo you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy
posthumus leonatus being so far provoked as i was in france i would
 abate her nothing though i profess myself her
 adorer not her friend
iachimo as fair and as gooda kind of handinhand
 comparisonhad been something too fair and too good
 for any lady in britain if she went before others
 i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres
 many i have beheld i could not but believe she
 excelled many but i have not seen the most
 precious diamond that is nor you the lady
posthumus leonatus i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone
iachimo what do you esteem it at
posthumus leonatus more than the world enjoys
iachimo either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she's
 outprized by a trifle
posthumus leonatus you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if
 there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit
 for the gift the other is not a thing for sale
 and only the gift of the gods
iachimo which the gods have given you
posthumus leonatus which by their graces i will keep
iachimo you may wear her in title yours but you know
 strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your
 ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable
 estimations the one is but frail and the other
 casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished
 courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last
posthumus leonatus your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
 to convince the honour of my mistress if in the
 holding or loss of that you term her frail i do
 nothing doubt you have store of thieves
 notwithstanding i fear not my ring
philario let us leave here gentlemen
posthumus leonatus sir with all my heart this worthy signior i
 thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
iachimo with five times so much conversation i should get
 ground of your fair mistress make her go back even
 to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend
posthumus leonatus no no
iachimo i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
 your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it
 something but i make my wager rather against your
 confidence than her reputation and to bar your
 offence herein too i durst attempt it against any
 lady in the world
posthumus leonatus you are a great deal abused in too bold a
 persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what you're
 worthy of by your attempt
iachimo what's that
posthumus leonatus a repulse though your attempt as you call it
 deserve more a punishment too
philario gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly
 let it die as it was born and i pray you be
 better acquainted
iachimo would i had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
 approbation of what i have spoke
posthumus leonatus what lady would you choose to assail
iachimo yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe
 i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring
 that commend me to the court where your lady is
 with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
 second conference and i will bring from thence
 that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved
posthumus leonatus i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring
 i hold dear as my finger tis part of it
iachimo you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy
 ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot
 preserve it from tainting but i see you have some
 religion in you that you fear
posthumus leonatus this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a
 graver purpose i hope
iachimo i am the master of my speeches and would undergo
 what's spoken i swear
posthumus leonatus will you i shall but lend my diamond till your
 return let there be covenants drawn between's my
 mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
 unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here's my ring
philario i will have it no lay
iachimo by the gods it is one if i bring you no
 sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest
 bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats
 are yours so is your diamond too if i come off
 and leave her in such honour as you have trust in
 she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are
 yours provided i have your commendation for my more
 free entertainment
posthumus leonatus i embrace these conditions let us have articles
 betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if
 you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
 to understand you have prevailed i am no further
 your enemy she is not worth our debate if she
 remain unseduced you not making it appear
 otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you
 have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
 your sword
iachimo your hand a covenant we will have these things set
 down by lawful counsel and straight away for
 britain lest the bargain should catch cold and
 starve i will fetch my gold and have our two
 wagers recorded
posthumus leonatus agreed

 make haste who has the note of them
first lady i madam
queen dispatch
 exeunt ladies
 now master doctor have you brought those drugs
cornelius pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam
 presenting a small box
 but i beseech your grace without offence
 my conscience bids me askwherefore you have
 commanded of me those most poisonous compounds
 which are the movers of a languishing death
 but though slow deadly
queen i wonder doctor
 thou ask'st me such a question have i not been
 thy pupil long hast thou not learn'd me how
 to make perfumes distil preserve yea so
 that our great king himself doth woo me oft
 for my confections having thus far proceeded
 unless thou think'st me devilishis't not meet
 that i did amplify my judgment in
 other conclusions i will try the forces
 of these thy compounds on such creatures as
 we count not worth the hanging but none human
 to try the vigour of them and apply
 allayments to their act and by them gather
 their several virtues and effects
cornelius your highness
 shall from this practise but make hard your heart
 besides the seeing these effects will be
 both noisome and infectious
queen o content thee
 enter pisanio
 aside
 here comes a flattering rascal upon him
 will i first work he's for his master
 an enemy to my son how now pisanio
 doctor your service for this time is ended
 take your own way
cornelius aside i do suspect you madam
 but you shall do no harm
queen to pisanio hark thee a word
cornelius aside i do not like her she doth think she has
 strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit
 and will not trust one of her malice with
 a drug of such damn'd nature those she has
 will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
 which first perchance she'll prove on
 cats and dogs
 then afterward up higher but there is
 no danger in what show of death it makes
 more than the lockingup the spirits a time
 to be more fresh reviving she is fool'd
 with a most false effect and i the truer
 so to be false with her
queen no further service doctor
 until i send for thee
cornelius i humbly take my leave
 exit
queen weeps she still say'st thou dost thou think in time
 she will not quench and let instructions enter
 where folly now possesses do thou work
 when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
 i'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
 as great as is thy master greater for
 his fortunes all lie speechless and his name
 is at last gasp return he cannot nor
 continue where he is to shift his being
 is to exchange one misery with another
 and every day that comes comes to decay
 a day's work in him what shalt thou expect
 to be depender on a thing that leans
 who cannot be new built nor has no friends
 so much as but to prop him
 the queen drops the box pisanio takes it up
 thou takest up
 thou know'st not what but take it for thy labour
 it is a thing i made which hath the king
 five times redeem'd from death i do not know
 what is more cordial nay i prethee take it
 it is an earnest of a further good
 that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how
 the case stands with her do't as from thyself
 think what a chance thou changest on but think
 thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
 who shall take notice of thee i'll move the king
 to any shape of thy preferment such
 as thou'lt desire and then myself i chiefly
 that set thee on to this desert am bound
 to load thy merit richly call my women
 think on my words
 exit pisanio
 a sly and constant knave
 not to be shaked the agent for his master

 except she bend her humour shall be assured

 presents a letter
imogen thanks good sir
 you're kindly welcome
iachimo aside all of her that is out of door most rich
 if she be furnish'd with a mind so rare
 she is alone the arabian bird and i
 have lost the wager boldness be my friend

 or like the parthian i shall flying fight

imogen reads he is one of the noblest note to whose
 kindnesses i am most infinitely tied reflect upon
 him accordingly as you value your trust
 leonatus'
 so far i read aloud
 but even the very middle of my heart
 is warm'd by the rest and takes it thankfully
 you are as welcome worthy sir as i
 have words to bid you and shall find it so
 in all that i can do
iachimo thanks fairest lady
 what are men mad hath nature given them eyes
 to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
 of sea and land which can distinguish twixt
 the fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
 upon the number'd beach and can we not
 partition make with spectacles so precious
 twixt fair and foul
imogen what makes your admiration
iachimo it cannot be i the eye for apes and monkeys
 twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
 contemn with mows the other nor i the judgment
 for idiots in this case of favour would
 be wisely definite nor i the appetite
 sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
 should make desire vomit emptiness
 not so allured to feed
imogen what is the matter trow
iachimo the cloyed will
 that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
 both fill'd and running ravening first the lamb
 longs after for the garbage
imogen what dear sir

iachimo well madam
imogen is he disposed to mirth i hope he is
iachimo exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
 so merry and so gamesome he is call'd
 the briton reveller
imogen when he was here
 he did incline to sadness and ofttimes
 not knowing why
iachimo i never saw him sad
 there is a frenchman his companion one
 an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
 a gallian girl at home he furnaces
 the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton
 your lord i meanlaughs from's free lungs cries o
 can my sides hold to think that man who knows
 by history report or his own proof
 what woman is yea what she cannot choose
 but must be will his free hours languish for
 assured bondage'
imogen will my lord say so
iachimo ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
 it is a recreation to be by
 and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know
 some men are much to blame
imogen not he i hope
iachimo not he but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
 be used more thankfully in himself tis much
 in you which i account his beyond all talents
 whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound
 to pity too
imogen what do you pity sir
iachimo two creatures heartily
imogen am i one sir
 you look on me what wreck discern you in me
 deserves your pity
iachimo lamentable what
 to hide me from the radiant sun and solace
 i the dungeon by a snuff
imogen i pray you sir
 deliver with more openness your answers
 to my demands why do you pity me
iachimo that others do
 i was about to sayenjoy yourbut
 it is an office of the gods to venge it
 not mine to speak on t
imogen you do seem to know
 something of me or what concerns me pray you
 since doubling things go ill often hurts more
 than to be sure they do for certainties
 either are past remedies or timely knowing
 the remedy then borndiscover to me
 what both you spur and stop
iachimo had i this cheek
 to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
 whose every touch would force the feeler's soul
 to the oath of loyalty this object which
 takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
 fixing it only here should i damn'd then
 slaver with lips as common as the stairs
 that mount the capitol join gripes with hands
 made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as
 with labour then bypeeping in an eye
 base and unlustrous as the smoky light
 that's fed with stinking tallow it were fit
 that all the plagues of hell should at one time
 encounter such revolt
imogen my lord i fear
 has forgot britain
iachimo and himself not i
 inclined to this intelligence pronounce
 the beggary of his change but tis your graces
 that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
 charms this report out
imogen let me hear no more
iachimo o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
 with pity that doth make me sick a lady
 so fair and fasten'd to an empery
 would make the great'st king doubleto be partner'd
 with tomboys hired with that selfexhibition
 which your own coffers yield with diseased ventures
 that play with all infirmities for gold
 which rottenness can lend nature such boil'd stuff
 as well might poison poison be revenged
 or she that bore you was no queen and you
 recoil from your great stock
imogen revenged
 how should i be revenged if this be true
 as i have such a heart that both mine ears
 must not in haste abuseif it be true
 how should i be revenged
iachimo should he make me
 live like diana's priest betwixt cold sheets
 whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
 in your despite upon your purse revenge it
 i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
 more noble than that runagate to your bed
 and will continue fast to your affection
 still close as sure
imogen what ho pisanio
iachimo let me my service tender on your lips
imogen away i do condemn mine ears that have
 so long attended thee if thou wert honourable
 thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
 for such an end thou seek'stas base as strange
 thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
 from thy report as thou from honour and
 solicit'st here a lady that disdains
 thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio
 the king my father shall be made acquainted
 of thy assault if he shall think it fit
 a saucy stranger in his court to mart
 as in a romish stew and to expound
 his beastly mind to us he hath a court
 he little cares for and a daughter who
 he not respects at all what ho pisanio
iachimo o happy leonatus i may say
 the credit that thy lady hath of thee
 deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
 her assured credit blessed live you long
 a lady to the worthiest sir that ever
 country call'd his and you his mistress only
 for the most worthiest fit give me your pardon
 i have spoke this to know if your affiance
 were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
 that which he is new o'er and he is one
 the truest manner'd such a holy witch
 that he enchants societies into him
 half all men's hearts are his
imogen you make amends
iachimo he sits mongst men like a descended god
 he hath a kind of honour sets him off
 more than a mortal seeming be not angry
 most mighty princess that i have adventured
 to try your taking a false report which hath
 honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
 in the election of a sir so rare
 which you know cannot err the love i bear him
 made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
 unlike all others chaffless pray your pardon

 the best feather of our winghave mingled sums
 to buy a present for the emperor
 which i the factor for the rest have done
 in france tis plate of rare device and jewels
 of rich and exquisite form their values great
 and i am something curious being strange
 to have them in safe stowage may it please you
 to take them in protection
imogen willingly
 and pawn mine honour for their safety since
 my lord hath interest in them i will keep them
 in my bedchamber
iachimo they are in a trunk
 attended by my men i will make bold
 to send them to you only for this night

 fingering so we'll try with tongue too if none
 will do let her remain but i'll never give o'er
 first a very excellent goodconceited thing
 after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich
 words to it and then let her consider
 song
 hark hark the lark at heaven's gate sings
 and phoebus gins arise
 his steeds to water at those springs
 on chaliced flowers that lies
 and winking marybuds begin
 to ope their golden eyes
 with every thing that pretty is
 my lady sweet arise
 arise arise
cloten so get you gone if this penetrate i will
 consider your music the better if it do not it is

posthumus leonatus fear it not sir i would i were so sure
 to win the king as i am bold her honour
 will remain hers
philario what means do you make to him
posthumus leonatus not any but abide the change of time
 quake in the present winter's state and wish
 that warmer days would come in these sear'd hopes
 i barely gratify your love they failing
 i must die much your debtor
philario your very goodness and your company
 o'erpays all i can do by this your king
 hath heard of great augustus caius lucius
 will do's commission throughly and i think
 he'll grant the tribute send the arrearages
 or look upon our romans whose remembrance
 is yet fresh in their grief
posthumus leonatus i do believe
 statist though i am none nor like to be
 that this will prove a war and you shall hear
 the legions now in gallia sooner landed
 in our notfearing britain than have tidings
 of any penny tribute paid our countrymen
 are men more order'd than when julius caesar
 smiled at their lack of skill but found
 their courage
 worthy his frowning at their discipline
 now mingled with their courages will make known
 to their approvers they are people such
 that mend upon the world
 enter iachimo
philario see iachimo
posthumus leonatus the swiftest harts have posted you by land
 and winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails
 to make your vessel nimble
philario welcome sir
posthumus leonatus i hope the briefness of your answer made
 the speediness of your return
iachimo your lady
 is one of the fairest that i have look'd upon
posthumus leonatus and therewithal the best or let her beauty
 look through a casement to allure false hearts
 and be false with them
iachimo here are letters for you
posthumus leonatus their tenor good i trust
iachimo tis very like
philario was caius lucius in the britain court
 when you were there
iachimo he was expected then
 but not approach'd
posthumus leonatus all is well yet
 sparkles this stone as it was wont or is't not
 too dull for your good wearing
iachimo if i had lost it
 i should have lost the worth of it in gold
 i'll make a journey twice as far to enjoy
 a second night of such sweet shortness which
 was mine in britain for the ring is won
posthumus leonatus the stone's too hard to come by
iachimo not a whit
 your lady being so easy
posthumus leonatus make not sir
 your loss your sport i hope you know that we
 must not continue friends
iachimo good sir we must
 if you keep covenant had i not brought
 the knowledge of your mistress home i grant
 we were to question further but i now
 profess myself the winner of her honour
 together with your ring and not the wronger
 of her or you having proceeded but
 by both your wills
posthumus leonatus if you can make't apparent
 that you have tasted her in bed my hand
 and ring is yours if not the foul opinion
 you had of her pure honour gains or loses
 your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
 to who shall find them
iachimo sir my circumstances
 being so near the truth as i will make them
 must first induce you to believe whose strength
 i will confirm with oath which i doubt not
 you'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
 you need it not
posthumus leonatus proceed
iachimo first her bedchamber
 where i confess i slept not but profess
 had that was well worth watchingit was hang'd
 with tapesty of silk and silver the story
 proud cleopatra when she met her roman
 and cydnus swell'd above the banks or for
 the press of boats or pride a piece of work
 so bravely done so rich that it did strive
 in workmanship and value which i wonder'd
 could be so rarely and exactly wrought
 since the true life on't was
posthumus leonatus this is true
 and this you might have heard of here by me
 or by some other
iachimo more particulars
 must justify my knowledge
posthumus leonatus so they must
 or do your honour injury
iachimo the chimney
 is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
 chaste dian bathing never saw i figures
 so likely to report themselves the cutter
 was as another nature dumb outwent her
 motion and breath left out
posthumus leonatus this is a thing
 which you might from relation likewise reap
 being as it is much spoke of
iachimo the roof o the chamber
 with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons
 i had forgot themwere two winking cupids
 of silver each on one foot standing nicely
 depending on their brands
posthumus leonatus this is her honour
 let it be granted you have seen all thisand praise
 be given to your remembrancethe description
 of what is in her chamber nothing saves
 the wager you have laid
iachimo then if you can
 showing the bracelet
 be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see
 and now tis up again it must be married
 to that your diamond i'll keep them
posthumus leonatus jove
 once more let me behold it is it that
 which i left with her
iachimo siri thank herthat
 she stripp'd it from her arm i see her yet
 her pretty action did outsell her gift
 and yet enrich'd it too she gave it me and said
 she prized it once
posthumus leonatus may be she pluck'd it off
 to send it me
iachimo she writes so to you doth she
posthumus leonatus o no no no tis true here take this too
 gives the ring
 it is a basilisk unto mine eye
 kills me to look on't let there be no honour
 where there is beauty truth where semblance love
 where there's another man the vows of women
 of no more bondage be to where they are made
 than they are to their virtues which is nothing
 o above measure false
philario have patience sir
 and take your ring again tis not yet won
 it may be probable she lost it or
 who knows if one of her women being corrupted
 hath stol'n it from her
posthumus leonatus very true
 and so i hope he came by't back my ring
 render to me some corporal sign about her
 more evident than this for this was stolen
iachimo by jupiter i had it from her arm
posthumus leonatus hark you he swears by jupiter he swears
 tis truenay keep the ring'tis true i am sure
 she would not lose it her attendants are
 all sworn and honourablethey induced to steal it
 and by a strangerno he hath enjoyed her
 the cognizance of her incontinency
 is this she hath bought the name of whore
 thus dearly
 there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
 divide themselves between you
philario sir be patient
 this is not strong enough to be believed
 of one persuaded well of
posthumus leonatus never talk on't
 she hath been colted by him
iachimo if you seek
 for further satisfying under her breast
 worthy the pressinglies a mole right proud
 of that most delicate lodging by my life
 i kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger
 to feed again though full you do remember
 this stain upon her
posthumus leonatus ay and it doth confirm
 another stain as big as hell can hold
 were there no more but it
iachimo will you hear more
posthumus leonatus spare your arithmetic never count the turns
 once and a million
iachimo i'll be sworn
posthumus leonatus no swearing
 if you will swear you have not done't you lie
 and i will kill thee if thou dost deny
 thou'st made me cuckold
iachimo i'll deny nothing
posthumus leonatus o that i had her here to tear her limbmeal
 i will go there and do't i the court before
 her father i'll do something

philario quite besides
 the government of patience you have won

 he hath against himself

posthumus leonatus is there no way for men to be but women

 like a fullacorn'd boar a german one
 cried o and mounted found no opposition
 but what he look'd for should oppose and she
 should from encounter guard could i find out
 the woman's part in me for there's no motion
 that tends to vice in man but i affirm
 it is the woman's part be it lying note it
 the woman's flattering hers deceiving hers
 lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
 ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
 nice longing slanders mutability
 all faults that may be named nay that hell knows
 why hers in part or all but rather all
 for even to vice
 they are not constant but are changing still
 one vice but of a minute old for one
 not half so old as that i'll write against them
 detest them curse them yet tis greater skill

act iii
scene i britain a hall in cymbeline's palace
 enter in state cymbeline queen cloten
 and lords at one door and at another
 caius lucius and attendants
cymbeline now say what would augustus caesar with us
caius lucius when julius caesar whose remembrance yet
 lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
 be theme and hearing ever was in this britain
 and conquer'd it cassibelan thine uncle
 famous in caesar's praises no whit less
 than in his feats deserving itfor him
 and his succession granted rome a tribute
 yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
 is left untender'd
queen and to kill the marvel
 shall be so ever
cloten there be many caesars
 ere such another julius britain is
 a world by itself and we will nothing pay
 for wearing our own noses
queen that opportunity
 which then they had to take from s to resume
 we have again remember sir my liege
 the kings your ancestors together with
 the natural bravery of your isle which stands
 as neptune's park ribbed and paled in
 with rocks unscalable and roaring waters
 with sands that will not bear your enemies boats
 but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest
 caesar made here but made not here his brag
 of came and saw and overcame  with shame
 that first that ever touch'd himhe was carried
 from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping
 poor ignorant baubles upon our terrible seas
 like eggshells moved upon their surges crack'd
 as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof
 the famed cassibelan who was once at point
 o giglot fortuneto master caesar's sword
 made lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
 and britons strut with courage
cloten come there's no more tribute to be paid our
 kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and
 as i said there is no moe such caesars other of
 them may have crook'd noses but to owe such
 straight arms none
cymbeline son let your mother end
cloten we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
 cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a
 hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if
 caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or
 put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute
 for light else sir no more tribute pray you now
cymbeline you must know
 till the injurious romans did extort
 this tribute from us we were free
 caesar's ambition
 which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
 the sides o the world against all colour here
 did put the yoke upon s which to shake off
 becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
 ourselves to be
cloten 
 we do
lords 
cymbeline say then to caesar
 our ancestor was that mulmutius which
 ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of caesar
 hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
 shall by the power we hold be our good deed
 though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws
 who was the first of britain which did put
 his brows within a golden crown and call'd
 himself a king
caius lucius i am sorry cymbeline
 that i am to pronounce augustus caesar
 caesar that hath more kings his servants than
 thyself domestic officersthine enemy
 receive it from me then war and confusion
 in caesar's name pronounce i gainst thee look
 for fury not to be resisted thus defied
 i thank thee for myself
cymbeline thou art welcome caius
 thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent
 much under him of him i gather'd honour
 which he to seek of me again perforce
 behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect
 that the pannonians and dalmatians for
 their liberties are now in arms a precedent
 which not to read would show the britons cold
 so caesar shall not find them
caius lucius let proof speak
cloten his majesty bids you welcome make
 pastime with us a day or two or longer if
 you seek us afterwards in other terms you
 shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you
 beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in
 the adventure our crows shall fare the better
 for you and there's an end
caius lucius so sir
cymbeline i know your master's pleasure and he mine
 all the remain is welcome'

belarius now for our mountain sport up to yond hill
 your legs are young i'll tread these flats consider
 when you above perceive me like a crow
 that it is place which lessens and sets off
 and you may then revolve what tales i have told you
 of courts of princes of the tricks in war
 this service is not service so being done

 have never wing'd from view o the nest nor know not
 what air's from home haply this life is best
 if quiet life be best sweeter to you
 that have a sharper known well corresponding
 with your stiff age but unto us it is
 a cell of ignorance travelling abed
 a prison for a debtor that not dares
 to stride a limit
arviragus what should we speak of
 when we are old as you when we shall hear
 the rain and wind beat dark december how
 in this our pinching cave shall we discourse
 the freezing hours away we have seen nothing
 we are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
 like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
 our valour is to chase what flies our cage
 we make a quire as doth the prison'd bird
 and sing our bondage freely
belarius how you speak
 did you but know the city's usuries
 and felt them knowingly the art o the court
 as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
 is certain falling or so slippery that
 the fear's as bad as falling the toil o the war
 a pain that only seems to seek out danger

 as record of fair act nay many times
 doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse

 first with the best of note cymbeline loved me

 was not far off then was i as a tree
 whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
 a storm or robbery call it what you will
 shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
 and left me bare to weather
guiderius uncertain favour
belarius my fault being nothingas i have told you oft
 but that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd
 before my perfect honour swore to cymbeline
 i was confederate with the romans so
 follow'd my banishment and this twenty years
 this rock and these demesnes have been my world
 where i have lived at honest freedom paid
 more pious debts to heaven than in all
 the foreend of my time but up to the mountains

imogen thou told'st me when we came from horse the place
 was near at hand ne'er long'd my mother so
 to see me first as i have now pisanio man
 where is posthumus what is in thy mind
 that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh
 from the inward of thee one but painted thus
 would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
 beyond selfexplication put thyself
 into a havior of less fear ere wildness
 vanquish my staider senses what's the matter
 why tender'st thou that paper to me with
 a look untender if't be summer news
 smile to't before if winterly thou need'st
 but keep that countenance still my husband's hand
 that drugdamn'd italy hath outcraftied him
 and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue
 may take off some extremity which to read
 would be even mortal to me
pisanio please you read
 and you shall find me wretched man a thing
 the most disdain'd of fortune
imogen reads thy mistress pisanio hath played the
 strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie
 bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises
 but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
 as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio
 must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with
 the breach of hers let thine own hands take away
 her life i shall give thee opportunity at
 milfordhaven she hath my letter for the purpose
 where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
 it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
 equally to me disloyal'
pisanio what shall i need to draw my sword the paper
 hath cut her throat already no tis slander
 whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
 outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath
 rides on the posting winds and doth belie
 all corners of the world kings queens and states
 maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
 this viperous slander enters what cheer madam
imogen false to his bed what is it to be false
 to lie in watch there and to think on him
 to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep
 charge nature
 to break it with a fearful dream of him
 and cry myself awake that's false to's bed is it
pisanio alas good lady
imogen i false thy conscience witness iachimo
 thou didst accuse him of incontinency
 thou then look'dst like a villain now methinks
 thy favour's good enough some jay of italy
 whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him
 poor i am stale a garment out of fashion
 and for i am richer than to hang by the walls
 i must be ripp'dto pieces with meo
 men's vows are women's traitors all good seeming
 by thy revolt o husband shall be thought
 put on for villany not born where't grows
 but worn a bait for ladies
pisanio good madam hear me
imogen true honest men being heard like false aeneas
 were in his time thought false and sinon's weeping
 did scandal many a holy tear took pity
 from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus
 wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
 goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
 from thy great fall come fellow be thou honest
 do thou thy master's bidding when thou see'st him
 a little witness my obedience look
 i draw the sword myself take it and hit
 the innocent mansion of my love my heart
 fear not tis empty of all things but grief
 thy master is not there who was indeed
 the riches of it do his bidding strike
 thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
 but now thou seem'st a coward
pisanio hence vile instrument
 thou shalt not damn my hand
imogen why i must die
 and if i do not by thy hand thou art
 no servant of thy master's against selfslaughter
 there is a prohibition so divine
 that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart
 something's afore't soft soft we'll no defence
 obedient as the scabbard what is here
 the scriptures of the loyal leonatus
 all turn'd to heresy away away
 corrupters of my faith you shall no more
 be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools
 believe false teachers though those that
 are betray'd
 do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
 stands in worse case of woe
 and thou posthumus thou that didst set up
 my disobedience gainst the king my father
 and make me put into contempt the suits
 of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
 it is no act of common passage but
 a strain of rareness and i grieve myself
 to think when thou shalt be disedged by her
 that now thou tirest on how thy memory
 will then be pang'd by me prithee dispatch
 the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife
 thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
 when i desire it too
pisanio o gracious lady
 since i received command to do this business
 i have not slept one wink
imogen do't and to bed then
pisanio i'll wake mine eyeballs blind first
imogen wherefore then
 didst undertake it why hast thou abused
 so many miles with a pretence this place
 mine action and thine own our horses labour
 the time inviting thee the perturb'd court
 for my being absent whereunto i never
 purpose return why hast thou gone so far
 to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand
 the elected deer before thee
pisanio but to win time
 to lose so bad employment in the which
 i have consider'd of a course good lady
 hear me with patience
imogen talk thy tongue weary speak
 i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear
 therein false struck can take no greater wound
 nor tent to bottom that but speak
pisanio then madam
 i thought you would not back again
imogen most like
 bringing me here to kill me
pisanio not so neither
 but if i were as wise as honest then
 my purpose would prove well it cannot be
 but that my master is abused
 some villain ay and singular in his art
 hath done you both this cursed injury
imogen some roman courtezan
pisanio no on my life
 i'll give but notice you are dead and send him
 some bloody sign of it for tis commanded
 i should do so you shall be miss'd at court
 and that will well confirm it
imogen why good fellow
 what shall i do the where where bide how live
 or in my life what comfort when i am
 dead to my husband
pisanio if you'll back to the court
imogen no court no father nor no more ado
 with that harsh noble simple nothing
 that cloten whose lovesuit hath been to me
 as fearful as a siege
pisanio if not at court
 then not in britain must you bide
imogen where then
 hath britain all the sun that shines day night
 are they not but in britain i the world's volume
 our britain seems as of it but not in t
 in a great pool a swan's nest prithee think
 there's livers out of britain
pisanio i am most glad
 you think of other place the ambassador
 lucius the roman comes to milfordhaven
 tomorrow now if you could wear a mind
 dark as your fortune is and but disguise
 that which to appear itself must not yet be
 but by selfdanger you should tread a course
 pretty and full of view yea haply near
 the residence of posthumus so nigh at least
 that though his actions were not visible yet
 report should render him hourly to your ear
 as truly as he moves
imogen o for such means
 though peril to my modesty not death on't
 i would adventure
pisanio well then here's the point
 you must forget to be a woman change
 command into obedience fear and niceness
 the handmaids of all women or more truly
 woman its pretty selfinto a waggish courage
 ready in gibes quickanswer'd saucy and
 as quarrelous as the weasel nay you must
 forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
 exposing itbut o the harder heart
 alack no remedyto the greedy touch
 of commonkissing titan and forget
 your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
 you made great juno angry
imogen nay be brief
 i see into thy end and am almost
 a man already
pisanio first make yourself but like one
 forethinking this i have already fit
 tis in my cloakbagdoublet hat hose all
 that answer to them would you in their serving
 and with what imitation you can borrow
 from youth of such a season fore noble lucius
 present yourself desire his service tell him
 wherein you're happywhich you'll make him know
 if that his head have ear in musicdoubtless
 with joy he will embrace you for he's honourable
 and doubling that most holy your means abroad
 you have me rich and i will never fail
 beginning nor supplyment
imogen thou art all the comfort
 the gods will diet me with prithee away
 there's more to be consider'd but we'll even
 all that good time will give us this attempt
 i am soldier to and will abide it with
 a prince's courage away i prithee
pisanio well madam we must take a short farewell
 lest being miss'd i be suspected of
 your carriage from the court my noble mistress
 here is a box i had it from the queen
 what's in't is precious if you are sick at sea
 or stomachqualm'd at land a dram of this
 will drive away distemper to some shade
 and fit you to your manhood may the gods
 direct you to the best

 our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness
 the powers that he already hath in gallia
 will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves
 his war for britain
queen tis not sleepy business
 but must be look'd to speedily and strongly
cymbeline our expectation that it would be thus
 hath made us forward but my gentle queen
 where is our daughter she hath not appear'd
 before the roman nor to us hath tender'd
 the duty of the day she looks us like
 a thing more made of malice than of duty
 we have noted it call her before us for
 we have been too slight in sufferance
 exit an attendant
queen royal sir
 since the exile of posthumus most retired
 hath her life been the cure whereof my lord
 tis time must do beseech your majesty
 forbear sharp speeches to her she's a lady
 so tender of rebukes that words are strokes
 and strokes death to her
 reenter attendant
cymbeline where is she sir how
 can her contempt be answer'd
attendant please you sir
 her chambers are all lock'd and there's no answer
 that will be given to the loudest noise we make
queen my lord when last i went to visit her
 she pray'd me to excuse her keeping close
 whereto constrain'd by her infirmity
 she should that duty leave unpaid to you
 which daily she was bound to proffer this
 she wish'd me to make known but our great court
 made me to blame in memory

 exit cloten
 pisanio thou that stand'st so for posthumus
 he hath a drug of mine i pray his absence
 proceed by swallowing that for he believes
 it is a thing most precious but for her
 where is she gone haply despair hath seized her
 or wing'd with fervor of her love she's flown
 to her desired posthumus gone she is
 to death or to dishonour and my end
 can make good use of either she being down
 i have the placing of the british crown
 reenter cloten

 exit
cloten i love and hate her for she's fair and royal
 and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
 than lady ladies woman from every one
 the best she hath and she of all compounded
 outsells them all i love her therefore but
 disdaining me and throwing favours on
 the low posthumus slanders so her judgment
 that what's else rare is choked and in that point
 i will conclude to hate her nay indeed
 to be revenged upon her for when fools shall
 enter pisanio
 who is here what are you packing sirrah
 come hither ah you precious pander villain
 where is thy lady in a word or else
 thou art straightway with the fiends
pisanio o good my lord
cloten where is thy lady or by jupiter

 he is in rome
cloten where is she sir come nearer
 no further halting satisfy me home
 what is become of her
pisanio o my allworthy lord
cloten allworthy villain

 thy condemnation and thy death
pisanio then sir

 touching her flight
 presenting a letter
cloten let's see't i will pursue her
 even to augustus throne
pisanio aside or this or perish
 she's far enough and what he learns by this
 may prove his travel not her danger
cloten hum

 safe mayst thou wander safe return again
cloten sirrah is this letter true
pisanio sir as i think
cloten it is posthumus hand i know't sirrah if thou
 wouldst not be a villain but do me true service
 undergo those employments wherein i should have
 cause to use thee with a serious industry that is
 what villany soe'er i bid thee do to perform it
 directly and truly i would think thee an honest
 man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
 relief nor my voice for thy preferment
pisanio well my good lord
cloten wilt thou serve me for since patiently and
 constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
 that beggar posthumus thou canst not in the
 course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of
 mine wilt thou serve me

 thing i'll remember't anoneven there thou
 villain posthumus will i kill thee i would these
 garments were come she said upon a timethe
 bitterness of it i now belch from my heartthat she
 held the very garment of posthumus in more respect
 than my noble and natural person together with the
 adornment of my qualities with that suit upon my
 back will i ravish her first kill him and in her
 eyes there shall she see my valour which will then
 be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my
 speech of insultment ended on his dead body and
 when my lust hath dinedwhich as i say to vex
 her i will execute in the clothes that she so
 praisedto the court i'll knock her back foot
 her home again she hath despised me rejoicingly
 and i'll be merry in my revenge
 reenter pisanio with the clothes
 be those the garments
pisanio ay my noble lord
cloten how long is't since she went to milfordhaven
pisanio she can scarce be there yet
cloten bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second
 thing that i have commanded thee the third is
 that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design be
 but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself
 to thee my revenge is now at milford would i had
 wings to follow it come and be true

 are we not brothers
imogen so man and man should be
 but clay and clay differs in dignity
 whose dust is both alike i am very sick
guiderius go you to hunting i'll abide with him
imogen so sick i am not yet i am not well
 but not so citizen a wanton as
 to seem to die ere sick so please you leave me
 stick to your journal course the breach of custom
 is breach of all i am ill but your being by me
 cannot amend me society is no comfort
 to one not sociable i am not very sick
 since i can reason of it pray you trust me here
 i'll rob none but myself and let me die
 stealing so poorly
guiderius i love thee i have spoke it
 how much the quantity the weight as much
 as i do love my father
belarius what how how
arviragus if it be sin to say so i yoke me
 in my good brother's fault i know not why
 i love this youth and i have heard you say
 love's reason's without reason the bier at door
 and a demand who is't shall die i'd say
 my father not this youth'

 o worthiness of nature breed of greatness
 cowards father cowards and base things sire base
 nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace
 i'm not their father yet who this should be
 doth miracle itself loved before me

imogen i wish ye sport
arviragus you health so please you sir
imogen aside these are kind creatures gods what lies

 our courtiers say all's savage but at court
 experience o thou disprovest report
 the imperious seas breed monsters for the dish
 poor tributary rivers as sweet fish
 i am sick still heartsick pisanio
 i'll now taste of thy drug
 swallows some

 he said he was gentle but unfortunate
 dishonestly afflicted but yet honest
arviragus thus did he answer me yet said hereafter
 i might know more
belarius to the field to the field
 we'll leave you for this time go in and rest
arviragus we'll not be long away
belarius pray be not sick
 for you must be our housewife
imogen well or ill
 i am bound to you
belarius and shalt be ever
 exit imogen to the cave
 this youth how'er distress'd appears he hath had
 good ancestors
arviragus how angellike he sings
guiderius but his neat cookery he cut our roots
 in characters
 and sauced our broths as juno had been sick
 and he her dieter
arviragus nobly he yokes
 a smiling with a sigh as if the sigh
 was that it was for not being such a smile
 the smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
 from so divine a temple to commix
 with winds that sailors rail at
guiderius i do note
 that grief and patience rooted in him both
 mingle their spurs together
arviragus grow patience
 and let the stinking elder grief untwine
 his perishing root with the increasing vine
belarius it is great morning come away
 who's there
 enter cloten
cloten i cannot find those runagates that villain
 hath mock'd me i am faint
belarius those runagates'
 means he not us i partly know him tis
 cloten the son o the queen i fear some ambush
 i saw him not these many years and yet
 i know tis he we are held as outlaws hence
guiderius he is but one you and my brother search
 what companies are near pray you away
 let me alone with him
 exeunt belarius and arviragus
cloten soft what are you
 that fly me thus some villain mountaineers
 i have heard of such what slave art thou
guiderius a thing
 more slavish did i ne'er than answering
 a slave without a knock
cloten thou art a robber
 a lawbreaker a villain yield thee thief
guiderius to who to thee what art thou have not i
 an arm as big as thine a heart as big
 thy words i grant are bigger for i wear not
 my dagger in my mouth say what thou art
 why i should yield to thee
cloten thou villain base
 know'st me not by my clothes
guiderius no nor thy tailor rascal
 who is thy grandfather he made those clothes
 which as it seems make thee
cloten thou precious varlet
 my tailor made them not
guiderius hence then and thank
 the man that gave them thee thou art some fool
 i am loath to beat thee
cloten thou injurious thief
 hear but my name and tremble
guiderius what's thy name
cloten cloten thou villain
guiderius cloten thou double villain be thy name
 i cannot tremble at it were it toad or
 adder spider
 twould move me sooner
cloten to thy further fear
 nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know
 i am son to the queen
guiderius i am sorry for t not seeming
 so worthy as thy birth
cloten art not afeard
guiderius those that i reverence those i fear the wise
 at fools i laugh not fear them
cloten die the death
 when i have slain thee with my proper hand
 i'll follow those that even now fled hence
 and on the gates of lud'stown set your heads
 yield rustic mountaineer
 exeunt fighting
 reenter belarius and arviragus
belarius no companies abroad
arviragus none in the world you did mistake him sure
belarius i cannot tell long is it since i saw him
 but time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
 which then he wore the snatches in his voice
 and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute
 twas very cloten
arviragus in this place we left them
 i wish my brother make good time with him
 you say he is so fell
belarius being scarce made up
 i mean to man he had not apprehension
 of roaring terrors for the effect of judgment
 is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother
 reenter guiderius with cloten's head
guiderius this cloten was a fool an empty purse
 there was no money in't not hercules
 could have knock'd out his brains for he had none
 yet i not doing this the fool had borne
 my head as i do his
belarius what hast thou done
guiderius i am perfect what cut off one cloten's head
 son to the queen after his own report
 who call'd me traitor mountaineer and swore
 with his own single hand he'ld take us in
 displace our heads wherethank the godsthey grow
 and set them on lud'stown
belarius we are all undone
guiderius why worthy father what have we to lose
 but that he swore to take our lives the law
 protects not us then why should we be tender
 to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
 play judge and executioner all himself
 for we do fear the law what company
 discover you abroad
belarius no single soul
 can we set eye on but in all safe reason
 he must have some attendants though his humour
 was nothing but mutation ay and that
 from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
 absolute madness could so far have raved
 to bring him here alone although perhaps
 it may be heard at court that such as we
 cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
 may make some stronger head the which he hearing
 as it is like himmight break out and swear
 he'ld fetch us in yet is't not probable
 to come alone either he so undertaking
 or they so suffering then on good ground we fear
 if we do fear this body hath a tail
 more perilous than the head
arviragus let ordinance
 come as the gods foresay it howsoe'er
 my brother hath done well
belarius i had no mind
 to hunt this day the boy fidele's sickness
 did make my way long forth
guiderius with his own sword
 which he did wave against my throat i have ta'en
 his head from him i'll throw't into the creek
 behind our rock and let it to the sea
 and tell the fishes he's the queen's son cloten
 that's all i reck
 exit
belarius i fear twill be revenged
 would polydote thou hadst not done't though valour
 becomes thee well enough
arviragus would i had done't
 so the revenge alone pursued me polydore
 i love thee brotherly but envy much
 thou hast robb'd me of this deed i would revenges
 that possible strength might meet would seek us through
 and put us to our answer
belarius well tis done
 we'll hunt no more today nor seek for danger
 where there's no profit i prithee to our rock
 you and fidele play the cooks i'll stay
 till hasty polydote return and bring him
 to dinner presently
arviragus poor sick fidele
 i'll weringly to him to gain his colour
 i'ld let a parish of such clotens blood
 and praise myself for charity
 exit
belarius o thou goddess
 thou divine nature how thyself thou blazon'st
 in these two princely boys they are as gentle
 as zephyrs blowing below the violet
 not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
 their royal blood enchafed as the rudest wind
 that by the top doth take the mountain pine
 and make him stoop to the vale tis wonder
 that an invisible instinct should frame them
 to royalty unlearn'd honour untaught
 civility not seen from other valour
 that wildly grows in them but yields a crop
 as if it had been sow'd yet still it's strange
 what cloten's being here to us portends
 or what his death will bring us
 reenter guiderius
guiderius where's my brother
 i have sent cloten's clotpoll down the stream
 in embassy to his mother his body's hostage
 for his return
 solemn music
belarius my ingenious instrument
 hark polydore it sounds but what occasion
 hath cadwal now to give it motion hark
guiderius is he at home
belarius he went hence even now
guiderius what does he mean since death of my dear'st mother
 it did not speak before all solemn things
 should answer solemn accidents the matter
 triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
 is jollity for apes and grief for boys
 is cadwal mad
belarius look here he comes
 and brings the dire occasion in his arms
 of what we blame him for
 reenter arviragus with imogen as dead
 bearing her in his arms
arviragus the bird is dead
 that we have made so much on i had rather
 have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty
 to have turn'd my leapingtime into a crutch
 than have seen this
guiderius o sweetest fairest lily
 my brother wears thee not the one half so well
 as when thou grew'st thyself
belarius o melancholy
 who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
 the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
 might easiliest harbour in thou blessed thing
 jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i
 thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
 how found you him
arviragus stark as you see
 thus smiling as some fly hid tickled slumber
 not as death's dart being laugh'd at his
 right cheek
 reposing on a cushion
guiderius where
arviragus o the floor
 his arms thus leagued i thought he slept and put
 my clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
 answer'd my steps too loud
guiderius why he but sleeps
 if he be gone he'll make his grave a bed
 with female fairies will his tomb be haunted
 and worms will not come to thee
arviragus with fairest flowers
 whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele

 by a sharp torture
pisanio sir my life is yours
 i humbly set it at your will but for my mistress
 i nothing know where she remains why gone
 nor when she purposes return beseech your highness
 hold me your loyal servant
first lord good my liege
 the day that she was missing he was here

 all parts of his subjection loyally for cloten
 there wants no diligence in seeking him

 drawn on with torture
guiderius this is sir a doubt
 in such a time nothing becoming you

arviragus it is not likely
 that when they hear the roman horses neigh
 behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes

 that they will waste their time upon our note
 to know from whence we are
belarius o i am known
 of many in the army many years
 though cloten then but young you see not wore him
 from my remembrance and besides the king
 hath not deserved my service nor your loves
 who find in my exile the want of breeding
 the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
 to have the courtesy your cradle promised
 but to be still hot summer's tamings and
 the shrinking slaves of winter
guiderius than be so
 better to cease to be pray sir to the army

 so out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown

 to look upon the holy sun to have
 the benefit of his blest beams remaining
 so long a poor unknown

posthumus leonatus i did
 though you it seems come from the fliers
lord i did
posthumus leonatus no blame be to you sir for all was lost
 but that the heavens fought the king himself
 of his wings destitute the army broken
 and but the backs of britons seen all flying
 through a straight lane the enemy fullhearted
 lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work
 more plentiful than tools to do't struck down
 some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling
 merely through fear that the straight pass was damm'd
 with dead men hurt behind and cowards living
 to die with lengthen'd shame
lord where was this lane
posthumus leonatus close by the battle ditch'd and wall'd with turf
 which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
 an honest one i warrant who deserved
 so long a breeding as his white beard came to
 in doing this for's country athwart the lane

 the country base than to commit such slaughter
 with faces fit for masks or rather fairer
 than those for preservation cased or shame

 rather to wonder at the things you hear
 than to work any will you rhyme upon't

 leonati brothers to posthumus leonatus with
 wounds as they died in the wars they circle

 whose face i never saw
 i died whilst in the womb he stay'd
 attending nature's law
 whose father then as men report
 thou orphans father art
 thou shouldst have been and shielded him
 from this earthvexing smart
mother lucina lent not me her aid
 but took me in my throes
 that from me was posthumus ript
 came crying mongst his foes
 a thing of pity
sicilius leonatus great nature like his ancestry
 moulded the stuff so fair
 that he deserved the praise o the world
 as great sicilius heir
first brother when once he was mature for man
 in britain where was he
 that could stand up his parallel
 or fruitful object be
 in eye of imogen that best
 could deem his dignity
mother with marriage wherefore was he mock'd
 to be exiled and thrown
 from leonati seat and cast
 from her his dearest one
 sweet imogen
sicilius leonatus why did you suffer iachimo
 slight thing of italy
 to taint his nobler heart and brain
 with needless jealosy
 and to become the geck and scorn
 o th other's villany
second brother for this from stiller seats we came
 our parents and us twain
 that striking in our country's cause
 fell bravely and were slain
 our fealty and tenantius right
 with honour to maintain
first brother like hardiment posthumus hath
 to cymbeline perform'd
 then jupiter thou king of gods
 why hast thou thus adjourn'd
 the graces for his merits due
 being all to dolours turn'd
sicilius leonatus thy crystal window ope look out
 no longer exercise
 upon a valiant race thy harsh
 and potent injuries
mother since jupiter our son is good
 take off his miseries
sicilius leonatus peep through thy marble mansion help
 or we poor ghosts will cry
 to the shining synod of the rest
 against thy deity
first brother help jupiter or we appeal
 and from thy justice fly
second brother 
 jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting
 upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt the
 apparitions fall on their knees
jupiter no more you petty spirits of region low
 offend our hearing hush how dare you ghosts
 accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
 skyplanted batters all rebelling coasts
 poor shadows of elysium hence and rest
 upon your neverwithering banks of flowers
 be not with mortal accidents opprest
 no care of yours it is you know tis ours
 whom best i love i cross to make my gift
 the more delay'd delighted be content
 your lowlaid son our godhead will uplift
 his comforts thrive his trials well are spent
 our jovial star reign'd at his birth and in
 our temple was he married rise and fade
 he shall be lord of lady imogen
 and happier much by his affliction made
 this tablet lay upon his breast wherein
 our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
 and so away no further with your din
 express impatience lest you stir up mine
 mount eagle to my palace crystalline
 ascends
sicilius leonatus he came in thunder his celestial breath
 was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle
 stoop'd as to foot us his ascension is
 more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird
 prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
 as when his god is pleased
all thanks jupiter
sicilius leonatus the marble pavement closes he is enter'd
 his radiant root away and to be blest
 let us with care perform his great behest
 the apparitions vanish
posthumus leonatus waking sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot
 a father to me and thou hast created
 a mother and two brothers but o scorn
 gone they went hence so soon as they were born
 and so i am awake poor wretches that depend
 on greatness favour dream as i have done
 wake and find nothing but alas i swerve
 many dream not to find neither deserve
 and yet are steep'd in favours so am i
 that have this golden chance and know not why
 what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare one
 be not as is our fangled world a garment
 nobler than that it covers let thy effects
 so follow to be most unlike our courtiers
 as good as promise
 reads
 when as a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown
 without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of
 tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be
 lopped branches which being dead many years
 shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and
 freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries
 britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty'
 tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
 tongue and brain not either both or nothing
 or senseless speaking or a speaking such
 as sense cannot untie be what it is
 the action of my life is like it which
 i'll keep if but for sympathy
 reenter first gaoler
first gaoler come sir are you ready for death
posthumus leonatus overroasted rather ready long ago
first gaoler hanging is the word sir if
 you be ready for that you are well cooked
posthumus leonatus so if i prove a good repast to the
 spectators the dish pays the shot
first gaoler a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is
 you shall be called to no more payments fear no
 more tavernbills which are often the sadness of
 parting as the procuring of mirth you come in
 flint for want of meat depart reeling with too
 much drink sorry that you have paid too much and
 sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain
 both empty the brain the heavier for being too
 light the purse too light being drawn of
 heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be
 quit o the charity of a penny cord it sums up
 thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and
 creditor but it of what's past is and to come
 the discharge your neck sir is pen book and
 counters so the acquittance follows
posthumus leonatus i am merrier to die than thou art to live
first gaoler indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the
 toothache but a man that were to sleep your
 sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he
 would change places with his officer for look you
 sir you know not which way you shall go
posthumus leonatus yes indeed do i fellow
first gaoler your death has eyes in s head then i have not seen
 him so pictured you must either be directed by
 some that take upon them to know or do take upon
 yourself that which i am sure you do not know or
 jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how
 you shall speed in your journey's end i think you'll
 never return to tell one
posthumus leonatus i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to
 direct them the way i am going but such as wink and
 will not use them
first gaoler what an infinite mock is this that a man should
 have the best use of eyes to see the way of
 blindness i am sure hanging's the way of winking
 enter a messenger
messenger knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king
posthumus leonatus thou bring'st good news i am called to be made free
first gaoler i'll be hang'd then
posthumus leonatus thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead
 exeunt posthumus leonatus and messenger
first gaoler unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
 gibbets i never saw one so prone yet on my
 conscience there are verier knaves desire to live
 for all he be a roman and there be some of them

 that the poor soldier that so richly fought
 whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast
 stepp'd before larges of proof cannot be found
 he shall be happy that can find him if
 our grace can make him so
belarius i never saw
 such noble fury in so poor a thing
 such precious deeds in one that promises nought
 but beggary and poor looks
cymbeline no tidings of him
pisanio he hath been search'd among the dead and living
 but no trace of him
cymbeline to my grief i am
 the heir of his reward
 to belarius guiderius and arviragus
 which i will add
 to you the liver heart and brain of britain
 by whom i grant she lives tis now the time
 to ask of whence you are report it
belarius sir
 in cambria are we born and gentlemen
 further to boast were neither true nor modest
 unless i add we are honest
cymbeline bow your knees
 arise my knights o the battle i create you
 companions to our person and will fit you
 with dignities becoming your estates
 enter cornelius and ladies
 there's business in these faces why so sadly
 greet you our victory you look like romans
 and not o the court of britain
cornelius hail great king
 to sour your happiness i must report
 the queen is dead
cymbeline who worse than a physician
 would this report become but i consider
 by medicine life may be prolong'd yet death
 will seize the doctor too how ended she
cornelius with horror madly dying like her life
 which being cruel to the world concluded
 most cruel to herself what she confess'd
 i will report so please you these her women
 can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks
 were present when she finish'd
cymbeline prithee say
cornelius first she confess'd she never loved you only
 affected greatness got by you not you
 married your royalty was wife to your place
 abhorr'd your person
cymbeline she alone knew this
 and but she spoke it dying i would not
 believe her lips in opening it proceed
cornelius your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
 with such integrity she did confess
 was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
 but that her flight prevented it she had
 ta'en off by poison
cymbeline o most delicate fiend
 who is t can read a woman is there more
cornelius more sir and worse she did confess she had
 for you a mortal mineral which being took
 should by the minute feed on life and lingering
 by inches waste you in which time she purposed
 by watching weeping tendance kissing to
 o'ercome you with her show and in time
 when she had fitted you with her craft to work
 her son into the adoption of the crown
 but failing of her end by his strange absence
 grew shamelessdesperate open'd in despite
 of heaven and men her purposes repented
 the evils she hatch'd were not effected so
 despairing died
cymbeline heard you all this her women
first lady we did so please your highness
cymbeline mine eyes
 were not in fault for she was beautiful
 mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
 that thought her like her seeming it had
 been vicious
 to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter
 that it was folly in me thou mayst say
 and prove it in thy feeling heaven mend all
 enter lucius iachimo the soothsayer and other
 roman prisoners guarded posthumus leonatus
 behind and imogen
 thou comest not caius now for tribute that
 the britons have razed out though with the loss
 of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
 that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
 of you their captives which ourself have granted
 so think of your estate
caius lucius consider sir the chance of war the day
 was yours by accident had it gone with us
 we should not when the blood was cool
 have threaten'd
 our prisoners with the sword but since the gods
 will have it thus that nothing but our lives
 may be call'd ransom let it come sufficeth
 a roman with a roman's heart can suffer
 augustus lives to think on't and so much
 for my peculiar care this one thing only
 i will entreat my boy a briton born
 let him be ransom'd never master had
 a page so kind so duteous diligent
 so tender over his occasions true
 so feat so nurselike let his virtue join
 with my request which i make bold your highness
 cannot deny he hath done no briton harm
 though he have served a roman save him sir
 and spare no blood beside
cymbeline i have surely seen him
 his favour is familiar to me boy
 thou hast look'd thyself into my grace
 and art mine own i know not why wherefore
 to say live boy ne'er thank thy master live
 and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt
 fitting my bounty and thy state i'll give it
 yea though thou do demand a prisoner
 the noblest ta'en
imogen i humbly thank your highness
caius lucius i do not bid thee beg my life good lad
 and yet i know thou wilt
imogen no no alack
 there's other work in hand i see a thing
 bitter to me as death your life good master
 must shuffle for itself
caius lucius the boy disdains me
 he leaves me scorns me briefly die their joys
 that place them on the truth of girls and boys
 why stands he so perplex'd
cymbeline what wouldst thou boy
 i love thee more and more think more and more
 what's best to ask know'st him thou look'st on speak
 wilt have him live is he thy kin thy friend
imogen he is a roman no more kin to me
 than i to your highness who being born your vassal
 am something nearer
cymbeline wherefore eyest him so
imogen i'll tell you sir in private if you please
 to give me hearing
cymbeline ay with all my heart
 and lend my best attention what's thy name
imogen fidele sir
cymbeline thou'rt my good youth my page
 i'll be thy master walk with me speak freely
 cymbeline and imogen converse apart
belarius is not this boy revived from death
arviragus one sand another
 not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
 who died and was fidele what think you
guiderius the same dead thing alive
belarius peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear
 creatures may be alike were t he i am sure
 he would have spoke to us
guiderius but we saw him dead
belarius be silent let's see further
pisanio aside it is my mistress
 since she is living let the time run on
 to good or bad
 cymbeline and imogen come forward
cymbeline come stand thou by our side
 make thy demand aloud
 to iachimo
 sir step you forth
 give answer to this boy and do it freely
 or by our greatness and the grace of it
 which is our honour bitter torture shall
 winnow the truth from falsehood on speak to him
imogen my boon is that this gentleman may render
 of whom he had this ring
posthumus leonatus aside what's that to him
cymbeline that diamond upon your finger say
 how came it yours
iachimo thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
 which to be spoke would torture thee
cymbeline how me
iachimo i am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
 which torments me to conceal by villany
 i got this ring twas leonatus jewel
 whom thou didst banish andwhich more may
 grieve thee
 as it doth mea nobler sir ne'er lived
 twixt sky and ground wilt thou hear more my lord
cymbeline all that belongs to this
iachimo that paragon thy daughter
 for whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
 quail to remembergive me leave i faint
cymbeline my daughter what of her renew thy strength
 i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
 than die ere i hear more strive man and speak
iachimo upon a timeunhappy was the clock
 that struck the hourit was in romeaccursed
 the mansion where'twas at a feasto would
 our viands had been poison'd or at least
 those which i heaved to headthe good posthumus
 what should i say he was too good to be
 where ill men were and was the best of all
 amongst the rarest of good onessitting sadly
 hearing us praise our loves of italy
 for beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
 of him that best could speak for feature laming
 the shrine of venus or straightpight minerva
 postures beyond brief nature for condition
 a shop of all the qualities that man
 loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
 fairness which strikes the eye
cymbeline i stand on fire
 come to the matter
iachimo all too soon i shall
 unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus
 most like a noble lord in love and one
 that had a royal lover took his hint
 and not dispraising whom we praisedtherein
 he was as calm as virtuehe began
 his mistress picture which by his tongue
 being made
 and then a mind put in't either our brags
 were crack'd of kitchentrolls or his description
 proved us unspeaking sots
cymbeline nay nay to the purpose
iachimo your daughter's chastitythere it begins
 he spake of her as dian had hot dreams
 and she alone were cold whereat i wretch
 made scruple of his praise and wager'd with him
 pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore
 upon his honour'd finger to attain
 in suit the place of's bed and win this ring
 by hers and mine adultery he true knight
 no lesser of her honour confident
 than i did truly find her stakes this ring
 and would so had it been a carbuncle
 of phoebus wheel and might so safely had it
 been all the worth of's car away to britain
 post i in this design well may you sir
 remember me at court where i was taught
 of your chaste daughter the wide difference
 twixt amorous and villanous being thus quench'd
 of hope not longing mine italian brain
 gan in your duller britain operate
 most vilely for my vantage excellent
 and to be brief my practise so prevail'd
 that i return'd with simular proof enough
 to make the noble leonatus mad
 by wounding his belief in her renown
 with tokens thus and thus averting notes
 of chamberhanging pictures this her bracelet
 o cunning how i got itnay some marks
 of secret on her person that he could not
 but think her bond of chastity quite crack'd
 i having ta'en the forfeit whereupon
 methinks i see him now
posthumus leonatus advancing ay so thou dost
 italian fiend ay me most credulous fool
 egregious murderer thief any thing
 that's due to all the villains past in being
 to come o give me cord or knife or poison
 some upright justicer thou king send out
 for torturers ingenious it is i
 that all the abhorred things o the earth amend
 by being worse than they i am posthumus
 that kill'd thy daughtervillainlike i lie
 that caused a lesser villain than myself
 a sacrilegious thief to do't the temple
 of virtue was she yea and she herself
 spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set
 the dogs o the street to bay me every villain
 be call'd posthumus leonitus and
 be villany less than twas o imogen
 my queen my life my wife o imogen
 imogen imogen
imogen peace my lord hear hear
posthumus leonatus shall's have a play of this thou scornful page
 there lie thy part
 striking her she falls
pisanio o gentlemen help
 mine and your mistress o my lord posthumus
 you ne'er kill'd imogen til now help help
 mine honour'd lady
cymbeline does the world go round
posthumus leonatus how come these staggers on me
pisanio wake my mistress
cymbeline if this be so the gods do mean to strike me
 to death with mortal joy
pisanio how fares thy mistress
imogen o get thee from my sight
 thou gavest me poison dangerous fellow hence
 breathe not where princes are
cymbeline the tune of imogen
pisanio lady
 the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
 that box i gave you was not thought by me
 a precious thing i had it from the queen
cymbeline new matter still
imogen it poison'd me
cornelius o gods
 i left out one thing which the queen confess'd
 which must approve thee honest if pisanio
 have said she given his mistress that confection
 which i gave him for cordial she is served
 as i would serve a rat'
cymbeline what's this comelius
cornelius the queen sir very oft importuned me
 to temper poisons for her still pretending
 the satisfaction of her knowledge only
 in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
 of no esteem i dreading that her purpose
 was of more danger did compound for her
 a certain stuff which being ta'en would cease
 the present power of life but in short time
 all offices of nature should again
 do their due functions have you ta'en of it
imogen most like i did for i was dead
belarius my boys
 there was our error
guiderius this is sure fidele
imogen why did you throw your wedded lady from you
 think that you are upon a rock and now
 throw me again
 embracing him
posthumus leonatus hang there like a fruit my soul
 till the tree die
cymbeline how now my flesh my child
 what makest thou me a dullard in this act
 wilt thou not speak to me
imogen kneeling your blessing sir
belarius to guiderius and arviragus though you did love
 this youth i blame ye not
 you had a motive for't
cymbeline my tears that fall
 prove holy water on thee imogen
 thy mother's dead
imogen i am sorry for't my lord
cymbeline o she was nought and long of her it was
 that we meet here so strangely but her son
 is gone we know not how nor where
pisanio my lord
 now fear is from me i'll speak troth lord cloten
 upon my lady's missing came to me
 with his sword drawn foam'd at the mouth and swore
 if i discover'd not which way she was gone
 it was my instant death by accident
 had a feigned letter of my master's
 then in my pocket which directed him
 to seek her on the mountains near to milford
 where in a frenzy in my master's garments
 which he enforced from me away he posts
 with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
 my lady's honour what became of him
 i further know not
guiderius let me end the story
 i slew him there
cymbeline marry the gods forfend
 i would not thy good deeds should from my lips
 pluck a bard sentence prithee valiant youth
 deny't again
guiderius i have spoke it and i did it
cymbeline he was a prince
guiderius a most incivil one the wrongs he did me
 were nothing princelike for he did provoke me
 with language that would make me spurn the sea
 if it could so roar to me i cut off's head
 and am right glad he is not standing here
 to tell this tale of mine
cymbeline i am sorry for thee
 by thine own tongue thou art condemn'd and must
 endure our law thou'rt dead
imogen that headless man
 i thought had been my lord
cymbeline bind the offender
 and take him from our presence
belarius stay sir king
 this man is better than the man he slew
 as well descended as thyself and hath
 more of thee merited than a band of clotens
 had ever scar for
 to the guard
 let his arms alone
 they were not born for bondage
cymbeline why old soldier
 wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
 by tasting of our wrath how of descent
 as good as we
arviragus in that he spake too far
cymbeline and thou shalt die for't
belarius we will die all three
 but i will prove that two on's are as good
 as i have given out him my sons i must
 for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
 though haply well for you
arviragus your danger's ours
guiderius and our good his
belarius have at it then by leave
 thou hadst great king a subject who
 was call'd belarius
cymbeline what of him he is
 a banish'd traitor
belarius he it is that hath
 assumed this age indeed a banish'd man
 i know not how a traitor
cymbeline take him hence
 the whole world shall not save him
belarius not too hot
 first pay me for the nursing of thy sons
 and let it be confiscate all so soon
 as i have received it
cymbeline nursing of my sons
belarius i am too blunt and saucy here's my knee
 ere i arise i will prefer my sons
 then spare not the old father mighty sir
 these two young gentlemen that call me father
 and think they are my sons are none of mine
 they are the issue of your loins my liege
 and blood of your begetting
cymbeline how my issue
belarius so sure as you your father's i old morgan
 am that belarius whom you sometime banish'd
 your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
 itself and all my treason that i suffer'd
 was all the harm i did these gentle princes
 for such and so they arethese twenty years
 have i train'd up those arts they have as i
 could put into them my breeding was sir as
 your highness knows their nurse euriphile
 whom for the theft i wedded stole these children
 upon my banishment i moved her to't
 having received the punishment before
 for that which i did then beaten for loyalty
 excited me to treason their dear loss
 the more of you twas felt the more it shaped
 unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir
 here are your sons again and i must lose
 two of the sweet'st companions in the world
 the benediction of these covering heavens
 fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
 to inlay heaven with stars
cymbeline thou weep'st and speak'st
 the service that you three have done is more
 unlike than this thou tell'st i lost my children
 if these be they i know not how to wish
 a pair of worthier sons
belarius be pleased awhile
 this gentleman whom i call polydore
 most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius
 this gentleman my cadwal arviragus
 your younger princely son he sir was lapp'd
 in a most curious mantle wrought by the hand
 of his queen mother which for more probation
 i can with ease produce
cymbeline guiderius had
 upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
 it was a mark of wonder
belarius this is he
 who hath upon him still that natural stamp
 it was wise nature's end in the donation
 to be his evidence now
cymbeline o what am i
 a mother to the birth of three ne'er mother
 rejoiced deliverance more blest pray you be
 that after this strange starting from your orbs
 may reign in them now o imogen
 thou hast lost by this a kingdom
imogen no my lord
 i have got two worlds by t o my gentle brothers
 have we thus met o never say hereafter
 but i am truest speaker you call'd me brother
 when i was but your sister i you brothers
 when ye were so indeed
cymbeline did you e'er meet
arviragus ay my good lord
guiderius and at first meeting loved
 continued so until we thought he died
cornelius by the queen's dram she swallow'd
cymbeline o rare instinct
 when shall i hear all through this fierce
 abridgement
 hath to it circumstantial branches which
 distinction should be rich in where how lived you
 and when came you to serve our roman captive
 how parted with your brothers how first met them
 why fled you from the court and whither these
 and your three motives to the battle with
 i know not how much more should be demanded
 and all the other bydependencies
 from chance to chance but nor the time nor place
 will serve our long inter'gatories see
 posthumus anchors upon imogen
 and she like harmless lightning throws her eye
 on him her brother me her master hitting
 each object with a joy the counterchange
 is severally in all let's quit this ground
 and smoke the temple with our sacrifices
 to belarius
 thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever
imogen you are my father too and did relieve me
 to see this gracious season
cymbeline all o'erjoy'd
 save these in bonds let them be joyful too
 for they shall taste our comfort
imogen my good master
 i will yet do you service
caius lucius happy be you
cymbeline the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
 he would have well becomed this place and graced
 the thankings of a king
posthumus leonatus i am sir
 the soldier that did company these three
 in poor beseeming twas a fitment for
 the purpose i then follow'd that i was he
 speak iachimo i had you down and might
 have made you finish
iachimo kneeling i am down again
 but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
 as then your force did take that life beseech you
 which i so often owe but your ring first
 and here the bracelet of the truest princess
 that ever swore her faith
posthumus leonatus kneel not to me
 the power that i have on you is to spare you
 the malice towards you to forgive you live
 and deal with others better
cymbeline nobly doom'd
 we'll learn our freeness of a soninlaw
 pardon's the word to all
arviragus you holp us sir
 as you did mean indeed to be our brother
 joy'd are we that you are
posthumus leonatus your servant princes good my lord of rome
 call forth your soothsayer as i slept methought
 great jupiter upon his eagle back'd
 appear'd to me with other spritely shows
 of mine own kindred when i waked i found
 this label on my bosom whose containing
 is so from sense in hardness that i can
 make no collection of it let him show
 his skill in the construction
caius lucius philarmonus
soothsayer here my good lord
caius lucius read and declare the meaning
soothsayer reads when as a lion's whelp shall to himself
 unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a
 piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar
 shall be lopped branches which being dead many
 years shall after revive be jointed to the old
 stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end
 his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in
 peace and plenty'
 thou leonatus art the lion's whelp
 the fit and apt construction of thy name
 being leonatus doth import so much
 to cymbeline
 the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
 which we call mollis aer and mollis aer'
 we term it mulier which mulier i divine
 is this most constant wife who even now
 answering the letter of the oracle
 unknown to you unsought were clipp'd about
 with this most tender air
cymbeline this hath some seeming
soothsayer the lofty cedar royal cymbeline
 personates thee and thy lopp'd branches point
 thy two sons forth who by belarius stol'n
 for many years thought dead are now revived
 to the majestic cedar join'd whose issue
 promises britain peace and plenty
cymbeline well
 my peace we will begin and caius lucius
 although the victor we submit to caesar
 and to the roman empire promising
 to pay our wonted tribute from the which
 we were dissuaded by our wicked queen
 whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
 have laid most heavy hand
soothsayer the fingers of the powers above do tune
 the harmony of this peace the vision
 which i made known to lucius ere the stroke
 of this yet scarcecold battle at this instant
 is full accomplish'd for the roman eagle
 from south to west on wing soaring aloft
 lessen'd herself and in the beams o the sun
 so vanish'd which foreshow'd our princely eagle
 the imperial caesar should again unite
 his favour with the radiant cymbeline
 which shines here in the west
cymbeline laud we the gods
 and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
 from our blest altars publish we this peace
 to all our subjects set we forward let
 a roman and a british ensign wave
 friendly together so through lud'stown march
 and in the temple of great jupiter
 our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts
 set on there never was a war did cease
 ere bloody hands were wash'd with such a peace

 and dumain
ferdinand let fame that all hunt after in their lives
 live register'd upon our brazen tombs
 and then grace us in the disgrace of death
 when spite of cormorant devouring time
 the endeavor of this present breath may buy
 that honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
 and make us heirs of all eternity
 therefore brave conquerorsfor so you are
 that war against your own affections
 and the huge army of the world's desires
 our late edict shall strongly stand in force
 navarre shall be the wonder of the world
 our court shall be a little academe
 still and contemplative in living art
 you three biron dumain and longaville
 have sworn for three years term to live with me
 my fellowscholars and to keep those statutes
 that are recorded in this schedule here
 your oaths are pass'd and now subscribe your names
 that his own hand may strike his honour down
 that violates the smallest branch herein
 if you are arm'd to do as sworn to do
 subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too
longaville i am resolved tis but a three years fast
 the mind shall banquet though the body pine
 fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
 make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits
dumain my loving lord dumain is mortified
 the grosser manner of these world's delights
 he throws upon the gross world's baser slaves
 to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die
 with all these living in philosophy
biron i can but say their protestation over
 so much dear liege i have already sworn
 that is to live and study here three years
 but there are other strict observances
 as not to see a woman in that term
 which i hope well is not enrolled there
 and one day in a week to touch no food
 and but one meal on every day beside
 the which i hope is not enrolled there
 and then to sleep but three hours in the night
 and not be seen to wink of all the day
 when i was wont to think no harm all night
 and make a dark night too of half the day
 which i hope well is not enrolled there
 o these are barren tasks too hard to keep
 not to see ladies study fast not sleep
ferdinand your oath is pass'd to pass away from these
biron let me say no my liege an if you please
 i only swore to study with your grace
 and stay here in your court for three years space
longaville you swore to that biron and to the rest
biron by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest
 what is the end of study let me know
ferdinand why that to know which else we should not know
biron things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense
ferdinand ay that is study's godlike recompense
biron come on then i will swear to study so
 to know the thing i am forbid to know
 as thusto study where i well may dine
 when i to feast expressly am forbid
 or study where to meet some mistress fine
 when mistresses from common sense are hid
 or having sworn too hard a keeping oath
 study to break it and not break my troth
 if study's gain be thus and this be so
 study knows that which yet it doth not know
 swear me to this and i will ne'er say no
ferdinand these be the stops that hinder study quite
 and train our intellects to vain delight
biron why all delights are vain but that most vain
 which with pain purchased doth inherit pain
 as painfully to pore upon a book
 to seek the light of truth while truth the while
 doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
 light seeking light doth light of light beguile
 so ere you find where light in darkness lies
 your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
 study me how to please the eye indeed
 by fixing it upon a fairer eye
 who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
 and give him light that it was blinded by
 study is like the heaven's glorious sun
 that will not be deepsearch'd with saucy looks
 small have continual plodders ever won
 save base authority from others books
 these earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
 that give a name to every fixed star
 have no more profit of their shining nights
 than those that walk and wot not what they are
 too much to know is to know nought but fame
 and every godfather can give a name
ferdinand how well he's read to reason against reading
dumain proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
longaville he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
biron the spring is near when green geese are abreeding
dumain how follows that
biron fit in his place and time
dumain in reason nothing
biron something then in rhyme
ferdinand biron is like an envious sneaping frost
 that bites the firstborn infants of the spring
biron well say i am why should proud summer boast
 before the birds have any cause to sing
 why should i joy in any abortive birth
 at christmas i no more desire a rose
 than wish a snow in may's newfangled mirth
 but like of each thing that in season grows
 so you to study now it is too late
 climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate
ferdinand well sit you out go home biron adieu
biron no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you
 and though i have for barbarism spoke more
 than for that angel knowledge you can say
 yet confident i'll keep what i have swore
 and bide the penance of each three years day
 give me the paper let me read the same
 and to the strict'st decrees i'll write my name
ferdinand how well this yielding rescues thee from shame
biron reads item that no woman shall come within a
 mile of my court hath this been proclaimed
longaville four days ago
biron let's see the penalty
 reads
 on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty
longaville marry that did i
biron sweet lord and why
longaville to fright them hence with that dread penalty
biron a dangerous law against gentility
 reads
 item if any man be seen to talk with a woman
 within the term of three years he shall endure such
 public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise'
 this article my liege yourself must break
 for well you know here comes in embassy
 the french king's daughter with yourself to speak
 a maid of grace and complete majesty
 about surrender up of aquitaine
 to her decrepit sick and bedrid father
 therefore this article is made in vain
 or vainly comes the admired princess hither
ferdinand what say you lords why this was quite forgot
biron so study evermore is overshot
 while it doth study to have what it would
 it doth forget to do the thing it should
 and when it hath the thing it hunteth most
 tis won as towns with fire so won so lost
ferdinand we must of force dispense with this decree
 she must lie here on mere necessity
biron necessity will make us all forsworn
 three thousand times within this three years space
 for every man with his affects is born
 not by might master'd but by special grace
 if i break faith this word shall speak for me
 i am forsworn on mere necessity'
 so to the laws at large i write my name
 subscribes
 and he that breaks them in the least degree
 stands in attainder of eternal shame
 suggestions are to other as to me
 but i believe although i seem so loath
 i am the last that will last keep his oath
 but is there no quick recreation granted
ferdinand ay that there is our court you know is haunted
 with a refined traveller of spain
 a man in all the world's new fashion planted
 that hath a mint of phrases in his brain
 one whom the music of his own vain tongue
 doth ravish like enchanting harmony
 a man of complements whom right and wrong

 in highborn words the worth of many a knight
 from tawny spain lost in the world's debate
 how you delight my lords i know not i

biron armado is a most illustrious wight
 a man of firenew words fashion's own knight

 climb in the merriness
costard the matter is to me sir as concerning jaquenetta

costard in manner and form following sir all those three
 i was seen with her in the manorhouse sitting with
 her upon the form and taken following her into the
 park which put together is in manner and form
 following now sir for the mannerit is the
 manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form
 in some form
biron for the following sir
costard as it shall follow in my correction and god defend
 the right
ferdinand will you hear this letter with attention
biron as we would hear an oracle
costard such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh
ferdinand reads great deputy the welkin's vicegerent and
 sole dominator of navarre my soul's earth's god
 and body's fostering patron'
costard not a word of costard yet
ferdinand reads so it is'
costard it may be so but if he say it is so he is in
 telling true but so
ferdinand peace
costard be to me and every man that dares not fight
ferdinand no words
costard of other men's secrets i beseech you
ferdinand reads so it is besieged with sablecoloured
 melancholy i did commend the blackoppressing humour
 to the most wholesome physic of thy healthgiving
 air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to
 walk the time when about the sixth hour when
 beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down
 to that nourishment which is called supper so much
 for the time when now for the ground which which
 i mean i walked upon it is ycleped thy park then
 for the place where where i mean i did encounter
 that obscene and preposterous event that draweth
 from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which
 here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest
 but to the place where it standeth northnortheast
 and by east from the west corner of thy curious
 knotted garden there did i see that lowspirited
 swain that base minnow of thy mirth'
costard me
ferdinand reads that unlettered smallknowing soul'
costard me
ferdinand reads that shallow vassal'
costard still me
ferdinand reads which as i remember hight costard'
costard o me
ferdinand reads sorted and consorted contrary to thy
 established proclaimed edict and continent canon
 which witho withbut with this i passion to say
 wherewith
costard with a wench
ferdinand reads with a child of our grandmother eve a
 female or for thy more sweet understanding a
 woman him i as my everesteemed duty pricks me on
 have sent to thee to receive the meed of
 punishment by thy sweet grace's officer anthony
 dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and
 estimation'
dull me an't shall please you i am anthony dull
ferdinand reads for jaquenettaso is the weaker vessel

 and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring
 her to trial thine in all compliments of devoted
 and heartburning heat of duty
 don adriano de armado'
biron this is not so well as i looked for but the best
 that ever i heard
ferdinand ay the best for the worst but sirrah what say
 you to this
costard sir i confess the wench
ferdinand did you hear the proclamation
costard i do confess much of the hearing it but little of
 the marking of it
ferdinand it was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken
 with a wench
costard i was taken with none sir i was taken with a damsel
ferdinand well it was proclaimed damsel'
costard this was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin
ferdinand it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin'
costard if it were i deny her virginity i was taken with a maid
ferdinand this maid will not serve your turn sir
costard this maid will serve my turn sir
ferdinand sir i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast
 a week with bran and water
costard i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge
ferdinand and don armado shall be your keeper
 my lord biron see him deliver'd o'er
 and go we lords to put in practise that
 which each to other hath so strongly sworn
 exeunt ferdinand longaville and dumain
biron i'll lay my head to any good man's hat
 these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn
 sirrah come on
costard i suffer for the truth sir for true it is i was
 taken with jaquenetta and jaquenetta is a true
 girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of
 prosperity affliction may one day smile again and
 till then sit thee down sorrow

 love's labours lost
act i
scene ii the same
 enter don adriano de armado and moth
don
adriano de armado boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit
 grows melancholy
moth a great sign sir that he will look sad
don
adriano de armado why sadness is one and the selfsame thing dear imp
moth no no o lord sir no
don
adriano de armado how canst thou part sadness and melancholy my
 tender juvenal
moth by a familiar demonstration of the working my tough senior
don
adriano de armado why tough senior why tough senior
moth why tender juvenal why tender juvenal
don
adriano de armado i spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton
 appertaining to thy young days which we may
 nominate tender
moth and i tough senior as an appertinent title to your
 old time which we may name tough
don adriano de
armado pretty and apt
moth how mean you sir i pretty and my saying apt or
 i apt and my saying pretty
don
adriano de armado thou pretty because little
moth little pretty because little wherefore apt
don
adriano de armado and therefore apt because quick
moth speak you this in my praise master
don
adriano de armado in thy condign praise
moth i will praise an eel with the same praise
don
adriano de armado what that an eel is ingenious
moth that an eel is quick
don
adriano de armado i do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood
moth i am answered sir
don
adriano de armado i love not to be crossed
moth aside he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him
don
adriano de armado i have promised to study three years with the duke
moth you may do it in an hour sir
don
adriano de armado impossible
moth how many is one thrice told
don
adriano de armado i am ill at reckoning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster
moth you are a gentleman and a gamester sir
don
adriano de armado i confess both they are both the varnish of a
 complete man
moth then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of
 deuceace amounts to
don
adriano de armado it doth amount to one more than two
moth which the base vulgar do call three
don
adriano de armado true
moth why sir is this such a piece of study now here
 is three studied ere ye'll thrice wink and how
 easy it is to put years to the word three and
 study three years in two words the dancing horse
 will tell you
don
adriano de armado a most fine figure
moth to prove you a cipher
don
adriano de armado i will hereupon confess i am in love and as it is
 base for a soldier to love so am i in love with a
 base wench if drawing my sword against the humour
 of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
 thought of it i would take desire prisoner and
 ransom him to any french courtier for a newdevised
 courtesy i think scorn to sigh methinks i should
 outswear cupid comfort me boy what great men
 have been in love
moth hercules master
don
adriano de armado most sweet hercules more authority dear boy name
 more and sweet my child let them be men of good
 repute and carriage
moth samson master he was a man of good carriage great
 carriage for he carried the towngates on his back
 like a porter and he was in love
don
adriano de armado o wellknit samson strongjointed samson i do
 excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
 carrying gates i am in love too who was samson's
 love my dear moth
moth a woman master
don
adriano de armado of what complexion
moth of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four
don
adriano de armado tell me precisely of what complexion
moth of the seawater green sir
don
adriano de armado is that one of the four complexions
moth as i have read sir and the best of them too
don
adriano de armado green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a
 love of that colour methinks samson had small reason
 for it he surely affected her for her wit
moth it was so sir for she had a green wit
don
adriano de armado my love is most immaculate white and red
moth most maculate thoughts master are masked under
 such colours
don
adriano de armado define define welleducated infant
moth my father's wit and my mother's tongue assist me
don
adriano de armado sweet invocation of a child most pretty and
 pathetical
moth if she be made of white and red
 her faults will ne'er be known
 for blushing cheeks by faults are bred
 and fears by pale white shown
 then if she fear or be to blame
 by this you shall not know
 for still her cheeks possess the same
 which native she doth owe
 a dangerous rhyme master against the reason of
 white and red
don
adriano de armado is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar
moth the world was very guilty of such a ballad some
 three ages since but i think now tis not to be
 found or if it were it would neither serve for
 the writing nor the tune
don
adriano de armado i will have that subject newly writ o'er that i may
 example my digression by some mighty precedent
 boy i do love that country girl that i took in the
 park with the rational hind costard she deserves well
moth aside to be whipped and yet a better love than
 my master
don
adriano de armado sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love
moth and that's great marvel loving a light wench
don
adriano de armado i say sing
moth forbear till this company be past
 enter dull costard and jaquenetta
dull sir the duke's pleasure is that you keep costard
 safe and you must suffer him to take no delight
 nor no penance but a must fast three days a week
 for this damsel i must keep her at the park she
 is allowed for the daywoman fare you well
don
adriano de armado i do betray myself with blushing maid
jaquenetta man
don
adriano de armado i will visit thee at the lodge
jaquenetta that's hereby
don
adriano de armado i know where it is situate
jaquenetta lord how wise you are
don
adriano de armado i will tell thee wonders
jaquenetta with that face
don
adriano de armado i love thee
jaquenetta so i heard you say
don
adriano de armado and so farewell
jaquenetta fair weather after you
dull come jaquenetta away
 exeunt dull and jaquenetta
don
adriano de armado villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
 be pardoned
costard well sir i hope when i do it i shall do it on a
 full stomach
don
adriano de armado thou shalt be heavily punished
costard i am more bound to you than your fellows for they
 are but lightly rewarded
don
adriano de armado take away this villain shut him up
moth come you transgressing slave away
costard let me not be pent up sir i will fast being loose
moth no sir that were fast and loose thou shalt to prison
costard well if ever i do see the merry days of desolation
 that i have seen some shall see
moth what shall some see
costard nay nothing master moth but what they look upon
 it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
 words and therefore i will say nothing i thank
 god i have as little patience as another man and
 therefore i can be quiet
 exeunt moth and costard
don
adriano de armado i do affect the very ground which is base where
 her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which
 is basest doth tread i shall be forsworn which
 is a great argument of falsehood if i love and
 how can that be true love which is falsely
 attempted love is a familiar love is a devil
 there is no evil angel but love yet was samson so
 tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was
 solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit
 cupid's buttshaft is too hard for hercules club
 and therefore too much odds for a spaniard's rapier
 the first and second cause will not serve my turn
 the passado he respects not the duello he regards
 not his disgrace is to be called boy but his
 glory is to subdue men adieu valour rust rapier
 be still drum for your manager is in love yea
 he loveth assist me some extemporal god of rhyme
 for i am sure i shall turn sonnet devise wit
 write pen for i am for whole volumes in folio

act ii
scene i the same
 enter the princess of france rosaline maria
 katharine boyet lords and other attendants
boyet now madam summon up your dearest spirits
 consider who the king your father sends
 to whom he sends and what's his embassy
 yourself held precious in the world's esteem
 to parley with the sole inheritor
 of all perfections that a man may owe
 matchless navarre the plea of no less weight
 than aquitaine a dowry for a queen
 be now as prodigal of all dear grace
 as nature was in making graces dear
 when she did starve the general world beside
 and prodigally gave them all to you
princess good lord boyet my beauty though but mean
 needs not the painted flourish of your praise
 beauty is bought by judgement of the eye
 not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues
 i am less proud to hear you tell my worth
 than you much willing to be counted wise
 in spending your wit in the praise of mine
 but now to task the tasker good boyet
 you are not ignorant alltelling fame
 doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow
 till painful study shall outwear three years
 no woman may approach his silent court
 therefore to's seemeth it a needful course
 before we enter his forbidden gates
 to know his pleasure and in that behalf
 bold of your worthiness we single you
 as our bestmoving fair solicitor
 tell him the daughter of the king of france
 on serious business craving quick dispatch
 importunes personal conference with his grace
 haste signify so much while we attend
 like humblevisaged suitors his high will
boyet proud of employment willingly i go
princess all pride is willing pride and yours is so
 exit boyet
 who are the votaries my loving lords
 that are vowfellows with this virtuous duke
first lord lord longaville is one
princess know you the man
maria i know him madam at a marriagefeast
 between lord perigort and the beauteous heir
 of jaques falconbridge solemnized
 in normandy saw i this longaville
 a man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd
 well fitted in arts glorious in arms
 nothing becomes him ill that he would well
 the only soil of his fair virtue's gloss
 if virtue's gloss will stain with any soil
 is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will
 whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills
 it should none spare that come within his power
princess some merry mocking lord belike is't so
maria they say so most that most his humours know
princess such shortlived wits do wither as they grow
 who are the rest
katharine the young dumain a wellaccomplished youth
 of all that virtue love for virtue loved
 most power to do most harm least knowing ill
 for he hath wit to make an ill shape good
 and shape to win grace though he had no wit
 i saw him at the duke alencon's once
 and much too little of that good i saw
 is my report to his great worthiness
rosaline another of these students at that time
 was there with him if i have heard a truth
 biron they call him but a merrier man
 within the limit of becoming mirth
 i never spent an hour's talk withal
 his eye begets occasion for his wit
 for every object that the one doth catch
 the other turns to a mirthmoving jest
 which his fair tongue conceit's expositor
 delivers in such apt and gracious words
 that aged ears play truant at his tales
 and younger hearings are quite ravished
 so sweet and voluble is his discourse
princess god bless my ladies are they all in love
 that every one her own hath garnished
 with such bedecking ornaments of praise
first lord here comes boyet
 reenter boyet
princess now what admittance lord
boyet navarre had notice of your fair approach
 and he and his competitors in oath
 were all address'd to meet you gentle lady
 before i came marry thus much i have learnt
 he rather means to lodge you in the field
 like one that comes here to besiege his court
 than seek a dispensation for his oath
 to let you enter his unpeopled house
 here comes navarre
 enter ferdinand longaville dumain biron and
 attendants
ferdinand fair princess welcome to the court of navarre
princess fair i give you back again and welcome i have
 not yet the roof of this court is too high to be
 yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine
ferdinand you shall be welcome madam to my court
princess i will be welcome then conduct me thither
ferdinand hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath
princess our lady help my lord he'll be forsworn
ferdinand not for the world fair madam by my will
princess why will shall break it will and nothing else
ferdinand your ladyship is ignorant what it is
princess were my lord so his ignorance were wise
 where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
 i hear your grace hath sworn out housekeeping
 tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord
 and sin to break it
 but pardon me i am too suddenbold
 to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
 vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
 and suddenly resolve me in my suit
ferdinand madam i will if suddenly i may
princess you will the sooner that i were away
 for you'll prove perjured if you make me stay
biron did not i dance with you in brabant once
rosaline did not i dance with you in brabant once
biron i know you did
rosaline how needless was it then to ask the question
biron you must not be so quick
rosaline tis long of you that spur me with such questions
biron your wit's too hot it speeds too fast twill tire
rosaline not till it leave the rider in the mire
biron what time o day
rosaline the hour that fools should ask
biron now fair befall your mask
rosaline fair fall the face it covers
biron and send you many lovers
rosaline amen so you be none
biron nay then will i be gone
ferdinand madam your father here doth intimate
 the payment of a hundred thousand crowns
 being but the one half of an entire sum
 disbursed by my father in his wars
 but say that he or we as neither have
 received that sum yet there remains unpaid
 a hundred thousand more in surety of the which
 one part of aquitaine is bound to us
 although not valued to the money's worth
 if then the king your father will restore
 but that one half which is unsatisfied
 we will give up our right in aquitaine
 and hold fair friendship with his majesty
 but that it seems he little purposeth
 for here he doth demand to have repaid
 a hundred thousand crowns and not demands
 on payment of a hundred thousand crowns
 to have his title live in aquitaine
 which we much rather had depart withal
 and have the money by our father lent
 than aquitaine so gelded as it is
 dear princess were not his requests so far
 from reason's yielding your fair self should make
 a yielding gainst some reason in my breast
 and go well satisfied to france again
princess you do the king my father too much wrong
 and wrong the reputation of your name
 in so unseeming to confess receipt
 of that which hath so faithfully been paid
ferdinand i do protest i never heard of it
 and if you prove it i'll repay it back
 or yield up aquitaine
princess we arrest your word
 boyet you can produce acquittances
 for such a sum from special officers
 of charles his father
ferdinand satisfy me so
boyet so please your grace the packet is not come
 where that and other specialties are bound
 tomorrow you shall have a sight of them
ferdinand it shall suffice me at which interview
 all liberal reason i will yield unto
 meantime receive such welcome at my hand
 as honour without breach of honour may
 make tender of to thy true worthiness
 you may not come fair princess in my gates
 but here without you shall be so received
 as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart
 though so denied fair harbour in my house
 your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
 tomorrow shall we visit you again
princess sweet health and fair desires consort your grace
ferdinand thy own wish wish i thee in every place
 exit
biron lady i will commend you to mine own heart
rosaline pray you do my commendations i would be glad to see it
biron i would you heard it groan
rosaline is the fool sick
biron sick at the heart
rosaline alack let it blood
biron would that do it good
rosaline my physic says ay'
biron will you prick't with your eye
rosaline no point with my knife
biron now god save thy life
rosaline and yours from long living
biron i cannot stay thanksgiving
 retiring
dumain sir i pray you a word what lady is that same
boyet the heir of alencon katharine her name
dumain a gallant lady monsieur fare you well
 exit
longaville i beseech you a word what is she in the white
boyet a woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
longaville perchance light in the light i desire her name
boyet she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
longaville pray you sir whose daughter
boyet her mother's i have heard
longaville god's blessing on your beard
boyet good sir be not offended
 she is an heir of falconbridge
longaville nay my choler is ended
 she is a most sweet lady
boyet not unlike sir that may be
 exit longaville
biron what's her name in the cap
boyet rosaline by good hap
biron is she wedded or no
boyet to her will sir or so
biron you are welcome sir adieu
boyet farewell to me sir and welcome to you
 exit biron
maria that last is biron the merry madcap lord
 not a word with him but a jest
boyet and every jest but a word
princess it was well done of you to take him at his word
boyet i was as willing to grapple as he was to board
maria two hot sheeps marry
boyet and wherefore not ships
 no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
maria you sheep and i pasture shall that finish the jest
boyet so you grant pasture for me
 offering to kiss her
maria not so gentle beast
 my lips are no common though several they be
boyet belonging to whom
maria to my fortunes and me
princess good wits will be jangling but gentles agree
 this civil war of wits were much better used
 on navarre and his bookmen for here tis abused
boyet if my observation which very seldom lies
 by the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes
 deceive me not now navarre is infected
princess with what
boyet with that which we lovers entitle affected
princess your reason
boyet why all his behaviors did make their retire
 to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
 his heart like an agate with your print impress'd
 proud with his form in his eye pride express'd
 his tongue all impatient to speak and not see
 did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
 all senses to that sense did make their repair
 to feel only looking on fairest of fair
 methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye
 as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
 who tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd
 did point you to buy them along as you pass'd
 his face's own margent did quote such amazes
 that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
 i'll give you aquitaine and all that is his
 an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss
princess come to our pavilion boyet is disposed
boyet but to speak that in words which his eye hath
 disclosed
 i only have made a mouth of his eye
 by adding a tongue which i know will not lie
rosaline thou art an old lovemonger and speakest skilfully
maria he is cupid's grandfather and learns news of him
rosaline then was venus like her mother for her father is but grim
boyet do you hear my mad wenches
maria no
boyet what then do you see
rosaline ay our way to be gone
boyet you are too hard for me

moth master will you win your love with a french brawl
don
adriano de armado how meanest thou brawling in french
moth no my complete master but to jig off a tune at
 the tongue's end canary to it with your feet humour
 it with turning up your eyelids sigh a note and
 sing a note sometime through the throat as if you
 swallowed love with singing love sometime through
 the nose as if you snuffed up love by smelling
 love with your hat penthouselike o'er the shop of
 your eyes with your arms crossed on your thinbelly
 doublet like a rabbit on a spit or your hands in
 your pocket like a man after the old painting and
 keep not too long in one tune but a snip and away
 these are complements these are humours these
 betray nice wenches that would be betrayed without
 these and make them men of notedo you note
 methat most are affected to these

 well lords today we shall have our dispatch
 on saturday we will return to france
 then forester my friend where is the bush
 that we must stand and play the murderer in
forester hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice
 a stand where you may make the fairest shoot
princess i thank my beauty i am fair that shoot
 and thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot
forester pardon me madam for i meant not so
princess what what first praise me and again say no
 o shortlived pride not fair alack for woe
forester yes madam fair
princess nay never paint me now
 where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
 here good my glass take this for telling true
 fair payment for foul words is more than due
forester nothing but fair is that which you inherit
princess see see my beauty will be saved by merit
 o heresy in fair fit for these days
 a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
 but come the bow now mercy goes to kill
 and shooting well is then accounted ill
 thus will i save my credit in the shoot
 not wounding pity would not let me do't
 if wounding then it was to show my skill
 that more for praise than purpose meant to kill
 and out of question so it is sometimes
 glory grows guilty of detested crimes
 when for fame's sake for praise an outward part
 we bend to that the working of the heart
 as i for praise alone now seek to spill
 the poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill
boyet do not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty
 only for praise sake when they strive to be
 lords o'er their lords

 to any lady that subdues a lord

 commiseration on thy heroical vassal the
 magnanimous and most illustrate king cophetua set
 eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
 zenelophon and he it was that might rightly say
 veni vidi vici which to annothanize in the
 vulgaro base and obscure vulgarvidelicet he
 came saw and overcame he came one saw two
 overcame three who came the king why did he
 come to see why did he see to overcome to
 whom came he to the beggar what saw he the
 beggar who overcame he the beggar the
 conclusion is victory on whose side the king's
 the captive is enriched on whose side the
 beggar's the catastrophe is a nuptial on whose
 side the king's no on both in one or one in
 both i am the king for so stands the comparison
 thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness
 shall i command thy love i may shall i enforce
 thy love i could shall i entreat thy love i

 for tittles titles for thyself me thus
 expecting thy reply i profane my lips on thy foot

scene ii the same
 enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull
sir nathaniel very reverend sport truly and done in the testimony
 of a good conscience
holofernes the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe
 as the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in
 the ear of caelo the sky the welkin the heaven
 and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra
 the soil the land the earth
sir nathaniel truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly
 varied like a scholar at the least but sir i
 assure ye it was a buck of the first head
holofernes sir nathaniel haud credo
dull twas not a haud credo twas a pricket
holofernes most barbarous intimation yet a kind of
 insinuation as it were in via in way of
 explication facere as it were replication or
 rather ostentare to show as it were his
 inclination after his undressed unpolished
 uneducated unpruned untrained or rather
 unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to
 insert again my haud credo for a deer
dull i said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket
holofernes twicesod simplicity his coctus
 o thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look
sir nathaniel sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
 in a book he hath not eat paper as it were he
 hath not drunk ink his intellect is not
 replenished he is only an animal only sensible in
 the duller parts
 and such barren plants are set before us that we
 thankful should be
 which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that
 do fructify in us more than he
 for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
 so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school
 but omne bene say i being of an old father's mind
 many can brook the weather that love not the wind
dull you two are bookmen can you tell me by your wit
 what was a month old at cain's birth that's not five
 weeks old as yet
holofernes dictynna goodman dull dictynna goodman dull
dull what is dictynna
sir nathaniel a title to phoebe to luna to the moon
holofernes the moon was a month old when adam was no more
 and raught not to five weeks when he came to
 fivescore
 the allusion holds in the exchange
dull tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange
holofernes god comfort thy capacity i say the allusion holds
 in the exchange
dull and i say the pollusion holds in the exchange for
 the moon is never but a month old and i say beside
 that twas a pricket that the princess killed
holofernes sir nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph
 on the death of the deer and to humour the
 ignorant call i the deer the princess killed a pricket
sir nathaniel perge good master holofernes perge so it shall
 please you to abrogate scurrility
holofernes i will something affect the letter for it argues facility
 the preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
 pleasing pricket
 some say a sore but not a sore till now made
 sore with shooting
 the dogs did yell put l to sore then sorel jumps
 from thicket
 or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall ahooting
 if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores
 one sorel
 of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l
sir nathaniel a rare talent
dull aside if a talent be a claw look how he claws
 him with a talent
holofernes this is a gift that i have simple simple a
 foolish extravagant spirit full of forms figures
 shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions
 revolutions these are begot in the ventricle of
 memory nourished in the womb of pia mater and
 delivered upon the mellowing of occasion but the
 gift is good in those in whom it is acute and i am
 thankful for it
sir nathaniel sir i praise the lord for you and so may my
 parishioners for their sons are well tutored by
 you and their daughters profit very greatly under
 you you are a good member of the commonwealth
holofernes mehercle if their sons be ingenuous they shall
 want no instruction if their daughters be capable
 i will put it to them but vir sapit qui pauca
 loquitur a soul feminine saluteth us
 enter jaquenetta and costard
jaquenetta god give you good morrow master parson
holofernes master parson quasi person an if one should be
 pierced which is the one
costard marry master schoolmaster he that is likest to a hogshead
holofernes piercing a hogshead a good lustre of conceit in a
 tuft of earth fire enough for a flint pearl enough
 for a swine tis pretty it is well
jaquenetta good master parson be so good as read me this
 letter it was given me by costard and sent me
 from don armado i beseech you read it
holofernes fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra

 chi non ti vede non ti pretia
 old mantuan old mantuan who understandeth thee
 not loves thee not ut re sol la mi fa
 under pardon sir what are the contents or rather
 as horace says in hiswhat my soul verses
sir nathaniel ay sir and very learned
holofernes let me hear a staff a stanze a verse lege domine
sir nathaniel reads
 if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
 ah never faith could hold if not to beauty vow'd
 though to myself forsworn to thee i'll faithful prove
 those thoughts to me were oaks to thee like
 osiers bow'd
 study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
 where all those pleasures live that art would
 comprehend
 if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
 well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
 all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
 which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
 thy eye jove's lightning bears thy voice his dreadful thunder
 which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
 celestial as thou art o pardon love this wrong
 that sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue
holofernes you find not the apostraphas and so miss the
 accent let me supervise the canzonet here are
 only numbers ratified but for the elegancy
 facility and golden cadence of poesy caret
 ovidius naso was the man and why indeed naso
 but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
 fancy the jerks of invention imitari is nothing
 so doth the hound his master the ape his keeper
 the tired horse his rider but damosella virgin
 was this directed to you
jaquenetta ay sir from one monsieur biron one of the strange
 queen's lords
holofernes i will overglance the superscript to the
 snowwhite hand of the most beauteous lady
 rosaline i will look again on the intellect of
 the letter for the nomination of the party writing
 to the person written unto your ladyship's in all
 desired employment biron sir nathaniel this
 biron is one of the votaries with the king and here
 he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
 queen's which accidentally or by the way of
 progression hath miscarried trip and go my

 king it may concern much stay not thy
 compliment i forgive thy duty adieu

sir nathaniel sir you have done this in the fear of god very
 religiously and as a certain father saith
holofernes sir tell me not of the father i do fear colourable
 colours but to return to the verses did they
 please you sir nathaniel
sir nathaniel marvellous well for the pen
holofernes i do dine today at the father's of a certain pupil
 of mine where if before repast it shall please
 you to gratify the table with a grace i will on my
 privilege i have with the parents of the foresaid
 child or pupil undertake your ben venuto where i
 will prove those verses to be very unlearned
 neither savouring of poetry wit nor invention i
 beseech your society
sir nathaniel and thank you too for society saith the text is
 the happiness of life
holofernes and certes the text most infallibly concludes it
 to dull
 sir i do invite you too you shall not
 say me nay pauca verba away the gentles are at
 their game and we will to our recreation

 eyeby this light but for her eye i would not
 love her yes for her two eyes well i do nothing
 in the world but lie and lie in my throat by
 heaven i do love and it hath taught me to rhyme
 and to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme
 and here my melancholy well she hath one o my
 sonnets already the clown bore it the fool sent

 fool sweetest lady by the world i would not care
 a pin if the other three were in here comes one
 with a paper god give him grace to groan
 stands aside
 enter ferdinand with a paper
ferdinand ay me
biron aside shot by heaven proceed sweet cupid
 thou hast thumped him with thy birdbolt under the
 left pap in faith secrets
ferdinand reads
 so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
 to those fresh morning drops upon the rose
 as thy eyebeams when their fresh rays have smote
 the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
 nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
 through the transparent bosom of the deep
 as doth thy face through tears of mine give light
 thou shinest in every tear that i do weep
 no drop but as a coach doth carry thee
 so ridest thou triumphing in my woe
 do but behold the tears that swell in me
 and they thy glory through my grief will show
 but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
 my tears for glasses and still make me weep
 o queen of queens how far dost thou excel
 no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell
 how shall she know my griefs i'll drop the paper
 sweet leaves shade folly who is he comes here
 steps aside
 what longaville and reading listen ear
biron now in thy likeness one more fool appear
 enter longaville with a paper
longaville ay me i am forsworn
biron why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers
ferdinand in love i hope sweet fellowship in shame
biron one drunkard loves another of the name
longaville am i the first that have been perjured so
biron i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know
 thou makest the triumviry the cornercap of society
 the shape of love's tyburn that hangs up simplicity
longaville i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
 o sweet maria empress of my love
 these numbers will i tear and write in prose
biron o rhymes are guards on wanton cupid's hose
 disfigure not his slop
longaville this same shall go
 reads
 did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
 gainst whom the world cannot hold argument
 persuade my heart to this false perjury
 vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
 a woman i forswore but i will prove
 thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
 my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
 thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me
 vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
 then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
 exhalest this vapourvow in thee it is
 if broken then it is no fault of mine
 if by me broke what fool is not so wise
 to lose an oath to win a paradise
biron this is the livervein which makes flesh a deity
 a green goose a goddess pure pure idolatry
 god amend us god amend we are much out o the way
longaville by whom shall i send thiscompany stay
 steps aside
biron all hid all hid an old infant play
 like a demigod here sit i in the sky
 and wretched fools secrets heedfully o'ereye
 more sacks to the mill o heavens i have my wish
 enter dumain with a paper
 dumain transform'd four woodcocks in a dish
dumain o most divine kate
biron o most profane coxcomb
dumain by heaven the wonder in a mortal eye
biron by earth she is not corporal there you lie
dumain her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted
biron an ambercolour'd raven was well noted
dumain as upright as the cedar
biron stoop i say
 her shoulder is with child
dumain as fair as day
biron ay as some days but then no sun must shine
dumain o that i had my wish
longaville and i had mine
ferdinand and i mine too good lord
biron amen so i had mine is not that a good word
dumain i would forget her but a fever she
 reigns in my blood and will remember'd be
biron a fever in your blood why then incision
 would let her out in saucers sweet misprision
dumain once more i'll read the ode that i have writ
biron once more i'll mark how love can vary wit
dumain reads
 on a dayalack the day
 love whose month is ever may
 spied a blossom passing fair
 playing in the wanton air
 through the velvet leaves the wind
 all unseen can passage find
 that the lover sick to death
 wish himself the heaven's breath
 air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
 air would i might triumph so
 but alack my hand is sworn
 ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
 vow alack for youth unmeet
 youth so apt to pluck a sweet
 do not call it sin in me
 that i am forsworn for thee
 thou for whom jove would swear
 juno but an ethiope were
 and deny himself for jove
 turning mortal for thy love
 this will i send and something else more plain
 that shall express my true love's fasting pain
 o would the king biron and longaville
 were lovers too ill to example ill
 would from my forehead wipe a perjured note
 for none offend where all alike do dote
longaville advancing dumain thy love is far from charity
 you may look pale but i should blush i know
 to be o'erheard and taken napping so
ferdinand advancing come sir you blush as his your case is such
 you chide at him offending twice as much
 you do not love maria longaville
 did never sonnet for her sake compile
 nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
 his loving bosom to keep down his heart
 i have been closely shrouded in this bush
 and mark'd you both and for you both did blush
 i heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion
 saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
 ay me says one o jove the other cries
 one her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes
 to longaville
 you would for paradise break faith and troth
 to dumain
 and jove for your love would infringe an oath
 what will biron say when that he shall hear
 faith so infringed which such zeal did swear
 how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
 how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
 for all the wealth that ever i did see
 i would not have him know so much by me
biron now step i forth to whip hypocrisy
 advancing
 ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me
 good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
 these worms for loving that art most in love
 your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
 there is no certain princess that appears
 you'll not be perjured tis a hateful thing
 tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
 but are you not ashamed nay are you not
 all three of you to be thus much o'ershot
 you found his mote the king your mote did see
 but i a beam do find in each of three
 o what a scene of foolery have i seen
 of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
 o me with what strict patience have i sat
 to see a king transformed to a gnat
 to see great hercules whipping a gig
 and profound solomon to tune a jig
 and nestor play at pushpin with the boys
 and critic timon laugh at idle toys
 where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain
 and gentle longaville where lies thy pain
 and where my liege's all about the breast
 a caudle ho
ferdinand too bitter is thy jest
 are we betray'd thus to thy overview
biron not you to me but i betray'd by you
 i that am honest i that hold it sin
 to break the vow i am engaged in
 i am betray'd by keeping company
 with men like men of inconstancy
 when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
 or groan for love or spend a minute's time
 in pruning me when shall you hear that i
 will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
 a gait a state a brow a breast a waist
 a leg a limb
ferdinand soft whither away so fast
 a true man or a thief that gallops so
biron i post from love good lover let me go
 enter jaquenetta and costard
jaquenetta god bless the king
ferdinand what present hast thou there
costard some certain treason
ferdinand what makes treason here
costard nay it makes nothing sir
ferdinand if it mar nothing neither
 the treason and you go in peace away together
jaquenetta i beseech your grace let this letter be read
 our parson misdoubts it twas treason he said
ferdinand biron read it over
 giving him the paper
 where hadst thou it
jaquenetta of costard
ferdinand where hadst thou it
costard of dun adramadio dun adramadio
 biron tears the letter
ferdinand how now what is in you why dost thou tear it
biron a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it
longaville it did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it
dumain it is biron's writing and here is his name
 gathering up the pieces
biron to costard ah you whoreson loggerhead you were
 born to do me shame
 guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess
ferdinand what
biron that you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess
 he he and you and you my liege and i
 are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die
 o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more
dumain now the number is even
biron true true we are four
 will these turtles be gone
ferdinand hence sirs away
costard walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay
 exeunt costard and jaquenetta
biron sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
 as true we are as flesh and blood can be
 the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
 young blood doth not obey an old decree
 we cannot cross the cause why we were born
 therefore of all hands must we be forsworn
ferdinand what did these rent lines show some love of thine
biron did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline
 that like a rude and savage man of inde
 at the first opening of the gorgeous east
 bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
 kisses the base ground with obedient breast
 what peremptory eaglesighted eye
 dares look upon the heaven of her brow
 that is not blinded by her majesty
ferdinand what zeal what fury hath inspired thee now
 my love her mistress is a gracious moon
 she an attending star scarce seen a light
biron my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron
 o but for my love day would turn to night
 of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
 do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
 where several worthies make one dignity
 where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
 lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
 fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not
 to things of sale a seller's praise belongs
 she passes praise then praise too short doth blot
 a wither'd hermit fivescore winters worn
 might shake off fifty looking in her eye
 beauty doth varnish age as if newborn
 and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy
 o tis the sun that maketh all things shine
ferdinand by heaven thy love is black as ebony
biron is ebony like her o wood divine
 a wife of such wood were felicity
 o who can give an oath where is a book
 that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack
 if that she learn not of her eye to look
 no face is fair that is not full so black
ferdinand o paradox black is the badge of hell
 the hue of dungeons and the suit of night
 and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well
biron devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
 o if in black my lady's brows be deck'd
 it mourns that painting and usurping hair
 should ravish doters with a false aspect
 and therefore is she born to make black fair
 her favour turns the fashion of the days
 for native blood is counted painting now
 and therefore red that would avoid dispraise
 paints itself black to imitate her brow
dumain to look like her are chimneysweepers black
longaville and since her time are colliers counted bright
ferdinand and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack
dumain dark needs no candles now for dark is light
biron your mistresses dare never come in rain
 for fear their colours should be wash'd away
ferdinand twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
 i'll find a fairer face not wash'd today
biron i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here
ferdinand no devil will fright thee then so much as she
dumain i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
longaville look here's thy love my foot and her face see
biron o if the streets were paved with thine eyes
 her feet were much too dainty for such tread
dumain o vile then as she goes what upward lies
 the street should see as she walk'd overhead
ferdinand but what of this are we not all in love
biron nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
ferdinand then leave this chat and good biron now prove
 our loving lawful and our faith not torn
dumain ay marry there some flattery for this evil
longaville o some authority how to proceed
 some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
dumain some salve for perjury
biron tis more than need
 have at you then affection's men at arms
 consider what you first did swear unto
 to fast to study and to see no woman
 flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth
 say can you fast your stomachs are too young
 and abstinence engenders maladies
 and where that you have vow'd to study lords
 in that each of you have forsworn his book
 can you still dream and pore and thereon look
 for when would you my lord or you or you
 have found the ground of study's excellence
 without the beauty of a woman's face
 from women's eyes this doctrine i derive
 they are the ground the books the academes
 from whence doth spring the true promethean fire
 why universal plodding poisons up
 the nimble spirits in the arteries
 as motion and longduring action tires
 the sinewy vigour of the traveller
 now for not looking on a woman's face
 you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
 and study too the causer of your vow
 for where is any author in the world
 teaches such beauty as a woman's eye
 learning is but an adjunct to ourself
 and where we are our learning likewise is
 then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes
 do we not likewise see our learning there
 o we have made a vow to study lords
 and in that vow we have forsworn our books
 for when would you my liege or you or you
 in leaden contemplation have found out
 such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
 of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with
 other slow arts entirely keep the brain
 and therefore finding barren practisers
 scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
 but love first learned in a lady's eyes
 lives not alone immured in the brain
 but with the motion of all elements
 courses as swift as thought in every power
 and gives to every power a double power
 above their functions and their offices
 it adds a precious seeing to the eye
 a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind
 a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound
 when the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd
 love's feeling is more soft and sensible
 than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails
 love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste
 for valour is not love a hercules
 still climbing trees in the hesperides
 subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical
 as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair
 and when love speaks the voice of all the gods
 makes heaven drowsy with the harmony
 never durst poet touch a pen to write
 until his ink were temper'd with love's sighs
 o then his lines would ravish savage ears
 and plant in tyrants mild humility
 from women's eyes this doctrine i derive
 they sparkle still the right promethean fire
 they are the books the arts the academes
 that show contain and nourish all the world
 else none at all in ought proves excellent
 then fools you were these women to forswear
 or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
 for wisdom's sake a word that all men love
 or for love's sake a word that loves all men
 or for men's sake the authors of these women
 or women's sake by whom we men are men
 let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
 or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
 it is religion to be thus forsworn
 for charity itself fulfills the law
 and who can sever love from charity
ferdinand saint cupid then and soldiers to the field
biron advance your standards and upon them lords
 pellmell down with them but be first advised
 in conflict that you get the sun of them
longaville now to plaindealing lay these glozes by
 shall we resolve to woo these girls of france
ferdinand and win them too therefore let us devise
 some entertainment for them in their tents
biron first from the park let us conduct them thither
 then homeward every man attach the hand
 of his fair mistress in the afternoon
 we will with some strange pastime solace them
 such as the shortness of the time can shape
 for revels dances masks and merry hours
 forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers
ferdinand away away no time shall be omitted
 that will betime and may by us be fitted
biron allons allons sow'd cockle reap'd no corn
 and justice always whirls in equal measure
 light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
 if so our copper buys no better treasure

 love's labours lost
act v
scene ii the same
 enter the princess katharine rosaline and maria
princess sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
 if fairings come thus plentifully in
 a lady wall'd about with diamonds
 look you what i have from the loving king
rosaline madame came nothing else along with that
princess nothing but this yes as much love in rhyme
 as would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
 writ o both sides the leaf margent and all
 that he was fain to seal on cupid's name
rosaline that was the way to make his godhead wax
 for he hath been five thousand years a boy
katharine ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
rosaline you'll ne'er be friends with him a kill'd your sister
katharine he made her melancholy sad and heavy
 and so she died had she been light like you
 of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
 she might ha been a grandam ere she died
 and so may you for a light heart lives long
rosaline what's your dark meaning mouse of this light word
katharine a light condition in a beauty dark
rosaline we need more light to find your meaning out
katharine you'll mar the light by taking it in snuff
 therefore i'll darkly end the argument
rosaline look what you do you do it still i the dark
katharine so do not you for you are a light wench
rosaline indeed i weigh not you and therefore light
katharine you weigh me not o that's you care not for me
rosaline great reason for past cure is still past care'
princess well bandied both a set of wit well play'd
 but rosaline you have a favour too
 who sent it and what is it
rosaline i would you knew
 an if my face were but as fair as yours
 my favour were as great be witness this
 nay i have verses too i thank biron
 the numbers true and were the numbering too
 i were the fairest goddess on the ground
 i am compared to twenty thousand fairs
 o he hath drawn my picture in his letter
princess any thing like
rosaline much in the letters nothing in the praise
princess beauteous as ink a good conclusion
katharine fair as a text b in a copybook
rosaline ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor
 my red dominical my golden letter
 o that your face were not so full of o's
katharine a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows
princess but katharine what was sent to you from fair dumain
katharine madam this glove
princess did he not send you twain
katharine yes madam and moreover
 some thousand verses of a faithful lover
 a huge translation of hypocrisy
 vilely compiled profound simplicity
maria this and these pearls to me sent longaville
 the letter is too long by half a mile
princess i think no less dost thou not wish in heart
 the chain were longer and the letter short
maria ay or i would these hands might never part
princess we are wise girls to mock our lovers so
rosaline they are worse fools to purchase mocking so
 that same biron i'll torture ere i go
 o that i knew he were but in by the week
 how i would make him fawn and beg and seek
 and wait the season and observe the times
 and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
 and shape his service wholly to my hests
 and make him proud to make me proud that jests
 so perttauntlike would i o'ersway his state
 that he should be my fool and i his fate
princess none are so surely caught when they are catch'd
 as wit turn'd fool folly in wisdom hatch'd
 hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
 and wit's own grace to grace a learned fool
rosaline the blood of youth burns not with such excess
 as gravity's revolt to wantonness
maria folly in fools bears not so strong a note
 as foolery in the wise when wit doth dote
 since all the power thereof it doth apply
 to prove by wit worth in simplicity
princess here comes boyet and mirth is in his face
 enter boyet
boyet o i am stabb'd with laughter where's her grace
princess thy news boyet
boyet prepare madam prepare
 arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
 against your peace love doth approach disguised
 armed in arguments you'll be surprised
 muster your wits stand in your own defence
 or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
princess saint denis to saint cupid what are they
 that charge their breath against us say scout say
boyet under the cool shade of a sycamore
 i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
 when lo to interrupt my purposed rest
 toward that shade i might behold addrest
 the king and his companions warily
 i stole into a neighbour thicket by
 and overheard what you shall overhear
 that by and by disguised they will be here
 their herald is a pretty knavish page
 that well by heart hath conn'd his embassage
 action and accent did they teach him there
 thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear'
 and ever and anon they made a doubt
 presence majestical would put him out
 for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see
 yet fear not thou but speak audaciously'
 the boy replied an angel is not evil
 i should have fear'd her had she been a devil'
 with that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder
 making the bold wag by their praises bolder
 one rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore
 a better speech was never spoke before
 another with his finger and his thumb
 cried via we will do't come what will come'
 the third he caper'd and cried all goes well'
 the fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell
 with that they all did tumble on the ground
 with such a zealous laughter so profound
 that in this spleen ridiculous appears
 to cheque their folly passion's solemn tears
princess but what but what come they to visit us
boyet they do they do and are apparell'd thus
 like muscovites or russians as i guess
 their purpose is to parle to court and dance
 and every one his lovefeat will advance
 unto his several mistress which they'll know
 by favours several which they did bestow
princess and will they so the gallants shall be task'd
 for ladies we shall every one be mask'd
 and not a man of them shall have the grace
 despite of suit to see a lady's face
 hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
 and then the king will court thee for his dear
 hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
 so shall biron take me for rosaline
 and change your favours too so shall your loves
 woo contrary deceived by these removes
rosaline come on then wear the favours most in sight
katharine but in this changing what is your intent
princess the effect of my intent is to cross theirs
 they do it but in mocking merriment
 and mock for mock is only my intent
 their several counsels they unbosom shall
 to loves mistook and so be mock'd withal
 upon the next occasion that we meet
 with visages displayed to talk and greet
rosaline but shall we dance if they desire to't
princess no to the death we will not move a foot
 nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace
 but while tis spoke each turn away her face
boyet why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart
 and quite divorce his memory from his part
princess therefore i do it and i make no doubt
 the rest will ne'er come in if he be out
 there's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown
 to make theirs ours and ours none but our own
 so shall we stay mocking intended game
 and they well mock'd depart away with shame
 trumpets sound within
boyet the trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come
 the ladies mask
 enter blackamoors with music moth ferdinand
 biron longaville and dumain in russian habits
 and masked
moth all hail the richest beauties on the earth
boyet beauties no richer than rich taffeta
moth a holy parcel of the fairest dames
 the ladies turn their backs to him
 that ever turn'd theirbacksto mortal views
biron aside to moth their eyes villain their eyes
moth that ever turn'd their eyes to mortal viewsout
boyet true out indeed
moth out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
 not to behold
biron aside to moth once to behold rogue
moth once to behold with your sunbeamed eyes
 with your sunbeamed eyes
boyet they will not answer to that epithet
 you were best call it daughterbeamed eyes'
moth they do not mark me and that brings me out
biron is this your perfectness be gone you rogue
 exit moth
rosaline what would these strangers know their minds boyet
 if they do speak our language tis our will
 that some plain man recount their purposes
 know what they would
boyet what would you with the princess
biron nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline what would they say they
boyet nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline why that they have and bid them so be gone
boyet she says you have it and you may be gone
ferdinand say to her we have measured many miles
 to tread a measure with her on this grass
boyet they say that they have measured many a mile
 to tread a measure with you on this grass
rosaline it is not so ask them how many inches
 is in one mile if they have measured many
 the measure then of one is easily told
boyet if to come hither you have measured miles
 and many miles the princess bids you tell
 how many inches doth fill up one mile
biron tell her we measure them by weary steps
boyet she hears herself
rosaline how many weary steps
 of many weary miles you have o'ergone
 are number'd in the travel of one mile
biron we number nothing that we spend for you
 our duty is so rich so infinite
 that we may do it still without accompt
 vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
 that we like savages may worship it
rosaline my face is but a moon and clouded too
ferdinand blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
 vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
 those clouds removed upon our watery eyne
rosaline o vain petitioner beg a greater matter
 thou now request'st but moonshine in the water
ferdinand then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
 thou bid'st me beg this begging is not strange
rosaline play music then nay you must do it soon
 music plays
 not yet no dance thus change i like the moon
ferdinand will you not dance how come you thus estranged
rosaline you took the moon at full but now she's changed
ferdinand yet still she is the moon and i the man
 the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
rosaline our ears vouchsafe it
ferdinand but your legs should do it
rosaline since you are strangers and come here by chance
 we'll not be nice take hands we will not dance
ferdinand why take we hands then
rosaline only to part friends
 curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends
ferdinand more measure of this measure be not nice
rosaline we can afford no more at such a price
ferdinand prize you yourselves what buys your company
rosaline your absence only
ferdinand that can never be
rosaline then cannot we be bought and so adieu
 twice to your visor and half once to you
ferdinand if you deny to dance let's hold more chat
rosaline in private then
ferdinand i am best pleased with that
 they converse apart
biron whitehanded mistress one sweet word with thee
princess honey and milk and sugar there is three
biron nay then two treys and if you grow so nice
 metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice
 there's halfadozen sweets
princess seventh sweet adieu
 since you can cog i'll play no more with you
biron one word in secret
princess let it not be sweet
biron thou grievest my gall
princess gall bitter
biron therefore meet
 they converse apart
dumain will you vouchsafe with me to change a word
maria name it
dumain fair lady
maria say you so fair lord
 take that for your fair lady
dumain please it you
 as much in private and i'll bid adieu
 they converse apart
katharine what was your vizard made without a tongue
longaville i know the reason lady why you ask
katharine o for your reason quickly sir i long
longaville you have a double tongue within your mask
 and would afford my speechless vizard half
katharine veal quoth the dutchman is not veal a calf
longaville a calf fair lady
katharine no a fair lord calf
longaville let's part the word
katharine no i'll not be your half
 take all and wean it it may prove an ox
longaville look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
 will you give horns chaste lady do not so
katharine then die a calf before your horns do grow
longaville one word in private with you ere i die
katharine bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
 they converse apart
boyet the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
 as is the razor's edge invisible
 cutting a smaller hair than may be seen
 above the sense of sense so sensible
 seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
 fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things
rosaline not one word more my maids break off break off
biron by heaven all drybeaten with pure scoff
ferdinand farewell mad wenches you have simple wits
princess twenty adieus my frozen muscovits
 exeunt ferdinand lords and blackamoors
 are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at
boyet tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out
rosaline wellliking wits they have gross gross fat fat
princess o poverty in wit kinglypoor flout
 will they not think you hang themselves tonight
 or ever but in vizards show their faces
 this pert biron was out of countenance quite
rosaline o they were all in lamentable cases
 the king was weepingripe for a good word
princess biron did swear himself out of all suit
maria dumain was at my service and his sword
 no point quoth i my servant straight was mute
katharine lord longaville said i came o'er his heart
 and trow you what he called me
princess qualm perhaps
katharine yes in good faith
princess go sickness as thou art
rosaline well better wits have worn plain statutecaps
 but will you hear the king is my love sworn
princess and quick biron hath plighted faith to me
katharine and longaville was for my service born
maria dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree
boyet madam and pretty mistresses give ear
 immediately they will again be here
 in their own shapes for it can never be
 they will digest this harsh indignity
princess will they return
boyet they will they will god knows
 and leap for joy though they are lame with blows
 therefore change favours and when they repair
 blow like sweet roses in this summer air
princess how blow how blow speak to be understood
boyet fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud
 dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown
 are angels vailing clouds or roses blown
princess avaunt perplexity what shall we do
 if they return in their own shapes to woo
rosaline good madam if by me you'll be advised
 let's mock them still as well known as disguised
 let us complain to them what fools were here
 disguised like muscovites in shapeless gear
 and wonder what they were and to what end
 their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
 and their rough carriage so ridiculous
 should be presented at our tent to us
boyet ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand
princess whip to our tents as roes run o'er land
 exeunt princess rosaline katharine and maria
 reenter ferdinand biron longaville and dumain
 in their proper habits
ferdinand fair sir god save you where's the princess
boyet gone to her tent please it your majesty
 command me any service to her thither
ferdinand that she vouchsafe me audience for one word
boyet i will and so will she i know my lord
 exit
biron this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
 and utters it again when god doth please
 he is wit's pedler and retails his wares
 at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
 and we that sell by gross the lord doth know
 have not the grace to grace it with such show
 this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve
 had he been adam he had tempted eve
 a can carve too and lisp why this is he
 that kiss'd his hand away in courtesy
 this is the ape of form monsieur the nice
 that when he plays at tables chides the dice
 in honourable terms nay he can sing
 a mean most meanly and in ushering
 mend him who can the ladies call him sweet
 the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
 this is the flower that smiles on every one
 to show his teeth as white as whale's bone
 and consciences that will not die in debt
 pay him the due of honeytongued boyet
ferdinand a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
 that put armado's page out of his part
biron see where it comes behavior what wert thou
 till this madman show'd thee and what art thou now
 reenter the princess ushered by boyet rosaline
 maria and katharine
ferdinand all hail sweet madam and fair time of day
princess fair in all hail is foul as i conceive
ferdinand construe my speeches better if you may
princess then wish me better i will give you leave
ferdinand we came to visit you and purpose now
 to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then
princess this field shall hold me and so hold your vow
 nor god nor i delights in perjured men
ferdinand rebuke me not for that which you provoke
 the virtue of your eye must break my oath
princess you nickname virtue vice you should have spoke
 for virtue's office never breaks men's troth
 now by my maiden honour yet as pure
 as the unsullied lily i protest
 a world of torments though i should endure
 i would not yield to be your house's guest
 so much i hate a breaking cause to be
 of heavenly oaths vow'd with integrity
ferdinand o you have lived in desolation here
 unseen unvisited much to our shame
princess not so my lord it is not so i swear
 we have had pastimes here and pleasant game
 a mess of russians left us but of late
ferdinand how madam russians
princess ay in truth my lord
 trim gallants full of courtship and of state
rosaline madam speak true it is not so my lord
 my lady to the manner of the days
 in courtesy gives undeserving praise
 we four indeed confronted were with four
 in russian habit here they stay'd an hour
 and talk'd apace and in that hour my lord
 they did not bless us with one happy word
 i dare not call them fools but this i think
 when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink
biron this jest is dry to me fair gentle sweet
 your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
 with eyes best seeing heaven's fiery eye
 by light we lose light your capacity
 is of that nature that to your huge store
 wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor
rosaline this proves you wise and rich for in my eye
biron i am a fool and full of poverty
rosaline but that you take what doth to you belong
 it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue
biron o i am yours and all that i possess
rosaline all the fool mine
biron i cannot give you less
rosaline which of the vizards was it that you wore
biron where when what vizard why demand you this
rosaline there then that vizard that superfluous case
 that hid the worse and show'd the better face
ferdinand we are descried they'll mock us now downright
dumain let us confess and turn it to a jest
princess amazed my lord why looks your highness sad
rosaline help hold his brows he'll swoon why look you pale
 seasick i think coming from muscovy
biron thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
 can any face of brass hold longer out
 here stand i lady dart thy skill at me
 bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
 thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
 cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
 and i will wish thee never more to dance
 nor never more in russian habit wait
 o never will i trust to speeches penn'd
 nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue
 nor never come in vizard to my friend
 nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song
 taffeta phrases silken terms precise
 threepiled hyperboles spruce affectation
 figures pedantical these summerflies
 have blown me full of maggot ostentation
 i do forswear them and i here protest
 by this white glovehow white the hand god knows
 henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
 in russet yeas and honest kersey noes
 and to begin wenchso god help me la
 my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw
rosaline sans sans i pray you
biron yet i have a trick
 of the old rage bear with me i am sick
 i'll leave it by degrees soft let us see
 write lord have mercy on us on those three
 they are infected in their hearts it lies
 they have the plague and caught it of your eyes
 these lords are visited you are not free
 for the lord's tokens on you do i see
princess no they are free that gave these tokens to us
biron our states are forfeit seek not to undo us
rosaline it is not so for how can this be true
 that you stand forfeit being those that sue
biron peace for i will not have to do with you
rosaline nor shall not if i do as i intend
biron speak for yourselves my wit is at an end
ferdinand teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
 some fair excuse
princess the fairest is confession
 were not you here but even now disguised
ferdinand madam i was
princess and were you well advised
ferdinand i was fair madam
princess when you then were here
 what did you whisper in your lady's ear
ferdinand that more than all the world i did respect her
princess when she shall challenge this you will reject her
ferdinand upon mine honour no
princess peace peace forbear
 your oath once broke you force not to forswear
ferdinand despise me when i break this oath of mine
princess i will and therefore keep it rosaline
 what did the russian whisper in your ear
rosaline madam he swore that he did hold me dear
 as precious eyesight and did value me
 above this world adding thereto moreover
 that he would wed me or else die my lover
princess god give thee joy of him the noble lord
 most honourably doth unhold his word
ferdinand what mean you madam by my life my troth
 i never swore this lady such an oath
rosaline by heaven you did and to confirm it plain
 you gave me this but take it sir again
ferdinand my faith and this the princess i did give
 i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
princess pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
 and lord biron i thank him is my dear
 what will you have me or your pearl again
biron neither of either i remit both twain
 i see the trick on't here was a consent
 knowing aforehand of our merriment
 to dash it like a christmas comedy
 some carrytale some pleaseman some slight zany
 some mumblenews some trencherknight some dick
 that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
 to make my lady laugh when she's disposed
 told our intents before which once disclosed
 the ladies did change favours and then we
 following the signs woo'd but the sign of she
 now to our perjury to add more terror
 we are again forsworn in will and error
 much upon this it is and might not you
 to boyet
 forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
 do not you know my lady's foot by the squier
 and laugh upon the apple of her eye
 and stand between her back sir and the fire
 holding a trencher jesting merrily
 you put our page out go you are allow'd
 die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
 you leer upon me do you there's an eye
 wounds like a leaden sword

 enter mercade
mercade god save you madam
princess welcome mercade
 but that thou interrupt'st our merriment
mercade i am sorry madam for the news i bring
 is heavy in my tongue the king your father
princess dead for my life
mercade even so my tale is told
biron worthies away the scene begins to cloud
don
adriano de armado for mine own part i breathe free breath i have
 seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
 discretion and i will right myself like a soldier
 exeunt worthies
ferdinand how fares your majesty
princess boyet prepare i will away tonight
ferdinand madam not so i do beseech you stay
princess prepare i say i thank you gracious lords
 for all your fair endeavors and entreat
 out of a newsad soul that you vouchsafe
 in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
 the liberal opposition of our spirits
 if overboldly we have borne ourselves
 in the converse of breath your gentleness
 was guilty of it farewell worthy lord
 a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
 excuse me so coming too short of thanks
 for my great suit so easily obtain'd
ferdinand the extreme parts of time extremely forms
 all causes to the purpose of his speed
 and often at his very loose decides
 that which long process could not arbitrate
 and though the mourning brow of progeny
 forbid the smiling courtesy of love
 the holy suit which fain it would convince
 yet since love's argument was first on foot
 let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
 from what it purposed since to wail friends lost
 is not by much so wholesomeprofitable
 as to rejoice at friends but newly found
princess i understand you not my griefs are double
biron honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
 and by these badges understand the king
 for your fair sakes have we neglected time
 play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies
 hath much deform'd us fashioning our humours
 even to the opposed end of our intents
 and what in us hath seem'd ridiculous
 as love is full of unbefitting strains
 all wanton as a child skipping and vain
 form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye
 full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
 varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
 to every varied object in his glance
 which particoated presence of loose love
 put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
 have misbecomed our oaths and gravities
 those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
 suggested us to make therefore ladies
 our love being yours the error that love makes
 is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false
 by being once false for ever to be true
 to those that make us bothfair ladies you
 and even that falsehood in itself a sin
 thus purifies itself and turns to grace
princess we have received your letters full of love
 your favours the ambassadors of love
 and in our maiden council rated them
 at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
 as bombast and as lining to the time
 but more devout than this in our respects
 have we not been and therefore met your loves
 in their own fashion like a merriment
dumain our letters madam show'd much more than jest
longaville so did our looks
rosaline we did not quote them so
ferdinand now at the latest minute of the hour
 grant us your loves
princess a time methinks too short
 to make a worldwithoutend bargain in
 no no my lord your grace is perjured much
 full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
 if for my love as there is no such cause
 you will do aught this shall you do for me
 your oath i will not trust but go with speed
 to some forlorn and naked hermitage
 remote from all the pleasures of the world
 there stay until the twelve celestial signs
 have brought about the annual reckoning
 if this austere insociable life
 change not your offer made in heat of blood
 if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
 nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
 but that it bear this trial and last love
 then at the expiration of the year
 come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
 and by this virgin palm now kissing thine
 i will be thine and till that instant shut
 my woeful self up in a mourning house
 raining the tears of lamentation
 for the remembrance of my father's death
 if this thou do deny let our hands part
 neither entitled in the other's heart
ferdinand if this or more than this i would deny
 to flatter up these powers of mine with rest
 the sudden hand of death close up mine eye
 hence ever then my heart is in thy breast
biron and what to me my love and what to me
rosaline you must be purged too your sins are rack'd
 you are attaint with faults and perjury
 therefore if you my favour mean to get
 a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest
 but seek the weary beds of people sick
dumain but what to me my love but what to me a wife
katharine a beard fair health and honesty
 with threefold love i wish you all these three
dumain o shall i say i thank you gentle wife
katharine not so my lord a twelvemonth and a day
 i'll mark no words that smoothfaced wooers say
 come when the king doth to my lady come
 then if i have much love i'll give you some
dumain i'll serve thee true and faithfully till then
katharine yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again
longaville what says maria
maria at the twelvemonth's end
 i'll change my black gown for a faithful friend
longaville i'll stay with patience but the time is long
maria the liker you few taller are so young
biron studies my lady mistress look on me
 behold the window of my heart mine eye
 what humble suit attends thy answer there
 impose some service on me for thy love
rosaline oft have i heard of you my lord biron
 before i saw you and the world's large tongue
 proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
 full of comparisons and wounding flouts
 which you on all estates will execute
 that lie within the mercy of your wit
 to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
 and therewithal to win me if you please
 without the which i am not to be won
 you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
 visit the speechless sick and still converse
 with groaning wretches and your task shall be
 with all the fierce endeavor of your wit
 to enforce the pained impotent to smile
biron to move wild laughter in the throat of death
 it cannot be it is impossible
 mirth cannot move a soul in agony
rosaline why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit
 whose influence is begot of that loose grace
 which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
 a jest's prosperity lies in the ear
 of him that hears it never in the tongue
 of him that makes it then if sickly ears
 deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans
 will hear your idle scorns continue then
 and i will have you and that fault withal
 but if they will not throw away that spirit
 and i shall find you empty of that fault
 right joyful of your reformation
biron a twelvemonth well befall what will befall
 i'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital
princess to ferdinand ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave
ferdinand no madam we will bring you on your way
biron our wooing doth not end like an old play
 jack hath not jill these ladies courtesy
 might well have made our sport a comedy
ferdinand come sir it wants a twelvemonth and a day
 and then twill end
biron that's too long for a play

 mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo
 cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear
 unpleasing to a married ear
 when shepherds pipe on oaten straws
 and merry larks are ploughmen's clocks
 when turtles tread and rooks and daws
 and maidens bleach their summer smocks
 the cuckoo then on every tree
 mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo
 cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear
 unpleasing to a married ear
 
 winter
 when icicles hang by the wall
 and dick the shepherd blows his nail
 and tom bears logs into the hall
 and milk comes frozen home in pail

 while greasy joan doth keel the pot
 when all aloud the wind doth blow
 and coughing drowns the parson's saw

 fully unfold thyself and thy belongings
 are not thine own so proper as to waste
 thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
 heaven doth with us as we with torches do

mistress overdone what is there a maid with child by him
pompey no but there's a woman with maid by him you have
 not heard of the proclamation have you
mistress overdone what proclamation man
pompey all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down
mistress overdone and what shall become of those in the city
pompey they shall stand for seed they had gone down too
 but that a wise burgher put in for them
mistress overdone but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
 pulled down
pompey to the ground mistress
mistress overdone why here's a change indeed in the commonwealth
 what shall become of me
pompey come fear you not good counsellors lack no
 clients though you change your place you need not
 change your trade i'll be your tapster still
 courage there will be pity taken on you you that
 have worn your eyes almost out in the service you
 will be considered
mistress overdone what's to do here thomas tapster let's withdraw
pompey here comes signior claudio led by the provost to
 prison and there's madam juliet
 exeunt
 enter provost claudio juliet and officers
claudio fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world
 bear me to prison where i am committed
provost i do it not in evil disposition
 but from lord angelo by special charge
claudio thus can the demigod authority
 make us pay down for our offence by weight
 the words of heaven on whom it will it will
 on whom it will not so yet still tis just
 reenter lucio and two gentlemen
lucio why how now claudio whence comes this restraint
claudio from too much liberty my lucio liberty
 as surfeit is the father of much fast
 so every scope by the immoderate use
 turns to restraint our natures do pursue
 like rats that ravin down their proper bane
 a thirsty evil and when we drink we die
lucio if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would
 send for certain of my creditors and yet to say
 the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom
 as the morality of imprisonment what's thy
 offence claudio
claudio what but to speak of would offend again
lucio what is't murder
claudio no
lucio lechery
claudio call it so
provost away sir you must go
claudio one word good friend lucio a word with you
lucio a hundred if they'll do you any good
 is lechery so look'd after
claudio thus stands it with me upon a true contract
 i got possession of julietta's bed
 you know the lady she is fast my wife
 save that we do the denunciation lack
 of outward order this we came not to
 only for propagation of a dower
 remaining in the coffer of her friends
 from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
 till time had made them for us but it chances
 the stealth of our most mutual entertainment
 with character too gross is writ on juliet
lucio with child perhaps
claudio unhappily even so
 and the new deputy now for the duke
 whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
 or whether that the body public be
 a horse whereon the governor doth ride
 who newly in the seat that it may know
 he can command lets it straight feel the spur
 whether the tyranny be in his place
 or in his emmence that fills it up
 i stagger inbut this new governor
 awakes me all the enrolled penalties
 which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall
 so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
 and none of them been worn and for a name
 now puts the drowsy and neglected act
 freshly on me tis surely for a name
lucio i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on
 thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love
 may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to
 him
claudio i have done so but he's not to be found
 i prithee lucio do me this kind service
 this day my sister should the cloister enter
 and there receive her approbation
 acquaint her with the danger of my state
 implore her in my voice that she make friends
 to the strict deputy bid herself assay him
 i have great hope in that for in her youth
 there is a prone and speechless dialect
 such as move men beside she hath prosperous art
 when she will play with reason and discourse
 and well she can persuade
lucio i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the
 like which else would stand under grievous
 imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i
 would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
 game of ticktack i'll to her
claudio i thank you good friend lucio
lucio within two hours
claudio come officer away

scene iii a monastery
 enter duke vincentio and friar thomas
duke vincentio no holy father throw away that thought
 believe not that the dribbling dart of love
 can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee
 to give me secret harbour hath a purpose
 more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
 of burning youth
friar thomas may your grace speak of it
duke vincentio my holy sir none better knows than you
 how i have ever loved the life removed
 and held in idle price to haunt assemblies
 where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps
 i have deliver'd to lord angelo
 a man of stricture and firm abstinence
 my absolute power and place here in vienna
 and he supposes me travell'd to poland
 for so i have strew'd it in the common ear
 and so it is received now pious sir
 you will demand of me why i do this
friar thomas gladly my lord
duke vincentio we have strict statutes and most biting laws
 the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds
 which for this nineteen years we have let slip
 even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave
 that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers
 having bound up the threatening twigs of birch
 only to stick it in their children's sight
 for terror not to use in time the rod
 becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees
 dead to infliction to themselves are dead
 and liberty plucks justice by the nose
 the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
 goes all decorum
friar thomas it rested in your grace
 to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased
 and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
 than in lord angelo
duke vincentio i do fear too dreadful
 sith twas my fault to give the people scope
 twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
 for what i bid them do for we bid this be done
 when evil deeds have their permissive pass
 and not the punishment therefore indeed my father
 i have on angelo imposed the office
 who may in the ambush of my name strike home
 and yet my nature never in the fight
 to do in slander and to behold his sway
 i will as twere a brother of your order
 visit both prince and people therefore i prithee
 supply me with the habit and instruct me
 how i may formally in person bear me
 like a true friar more reasons for this action
 at our more leisure shall i render you
 only this one lord angelo is precise
 stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
 that his blood flows or that his appetite
 is more to bread than stone hence shall we see
 if power change purpose what our seemers be

scene iv a nunnery
 enter isabella and francisca
isabella and have you nuns no farther privileges
francisca are not these large enough
isabella yes truly i speak not as desiring more
 but rather wishing a more strict restraint
 upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare
lucio within ho peace be in this place
isabella who's that which calls
francisca it is a man's voice gentle isabella
 turn you the key and know his business of him
 you may i may not you are yet unsworn
 when you have vow'd you must not speak with men
 but in the presence of the prioress
 then if you speak you must not show your face
 or if you show your face you must not speak
 he calls again i pray you answer him
 exit
isabella peace and prosperity who is't that calls
 enter lucio
lucio hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses
 proclaim you are no less can you so stead me
 as bring me to the sight of isabella
 a novice of this place and the fair sister
 to her unhappy brother claudio
isabella why her unhappy brother let me ask
 the rather for i now must make you know
 i am that isabella and his sister
lucio gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
 not to be weary with you he's in prison
isabella woe me for what
lucio for that which if myself might be his judge
 he should receive his punishment in thanks
 he hath got his friend with child
isabella sir make me not your story
lucio it is true
 i would notthough tis my familiar sin
 with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
 tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so
 i hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted
 by your renouncement an immortal spirit
 and to be talk'd with in sincerity
 as with a saint
isabella you do blaspheme the good in mocking me
lucio do not believe it fewness and truth tis thus
 your brother and his lover have embraced
 as those that feed grow full as blossoming time
 that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
 to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
 expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
isabella some one with child by him my cousin juliet
lucio is she your cousin
isabella adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names
 by vain though apt affection
lucio she it is
isabella o let him marry her
lucio this is the point
 the duke is very strangely gone from hence
 bore many gentlemen myself being one
 in hand and hope of action but we do learn
 by those that know the very nerves of state
 his givingsout were of an infinite distance
 from his truemeant design upon his place
 and with full line of his authority
 governs lord angelo a man whose blood
 is very snowbroth one who never feels
 the wanton stings and motions of the sense
 but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
 with profits of the mind study and fast
 heto give fear to use and liberty
 which have for long run by the hideous law
 as mice by lionshath pick'd out an act
 under whose heavy sense your brother's life
 falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
 and follows close the rigour of the statute
 to make him an example all hope is gone
 unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
 to soften angelo and that's my pith of business
 twixt you and your poor brother
isabella doth he so seek his life
lucio has censured him
 already and as i hear the provost hath
 a warrant for his execution
isabella alas what poor ability's in me
 to do him good
lucio assay the power you have
isabella my power alas i doubt
lucio our doubts are traitors
 and make us lose the good we oft might win
 by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo
 and let him learn to know when maidens sue
 men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
 all their petitions are as freely theirs
 as they themselves would owe them
isabella i'll see what i can do
lucio but speedily
isabella i will about it straight
 no longer staying but to give the mother
 notice of my affair i humbly thank you
 commend me to my brother soon at night
 i'll send him certain word of my success
lucio i take my leave of you

scene i a hall in angelo's house
 enter angelo escalus and a justice provost
 officers and other attendants behind
angelo we must not make a scarecrow of the law
 setting it up to fear the birds of prey
 and let it keep one shape till custom make it
 their perch and not their terror
escalus ay but yet
 let us be keen and rather cut a little
 than fall and bruise to death alas this gentleman
 whom i would save had a most noble father
 let but your honour know
 whom i believe to be most strait in virtue
 that in the working of your own affections
 had time cohered with place or place with wishing
 or that the resolute acting of your blood
 could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose
 whether you had not sometime in your life
 err'd in this point which now you censure him
 and pull'd the law upon you
angelo tis one thing to be tempted escalus
 another thing to fall i not deny
 the jury passing on the prisoner's life
 may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
 guiltier than him they try what's open made to justice
 that justice seizes what know the laws
 that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant
 the jewel that we find we stoop and take't
 because we see it but what we do not see
 we tread upon and never think of it
 you may not so extenuate his offence
 for i have had such faults but rather tell me
 when i that censure him do so offend
 let mine own judgment pattern out my death
 and nothing come in partial sir he must die
escalus be it as your wisdom will
angelo where is the provost
provost here if it like your honour
angelo see that claudio
 be executed by nine tomorrow morning
 bring him his confessor let him be prepared
 for that's the utmost of his pilgrimage

 you're welcome what's your will
isabella i am a woeful suitor to your honour
 please but your honour hear me
angelo well what's your suit
isabella there is a vice that most i do abhor
 and most desire should meet the blow of justice
 for which i would not plead but that i must
 for which i must not plead but that i am
 at war twixt will and will not
angelo well the matter
isabella i have a brother is condemn'd to die
 i do beseech you let it be his fault
 and not my brother
provost aside heaven give thee moving graces
angelo condemn the fault and not the actor of it
 why every fault's condemn'd ere it be done
 mine were the very cipher of a function
 to fine the faults whose fine stands in record
 and let go by the actor
isabella o just but severe law
 i had a brother then heaven keep your honour
lucio aside to isabella give't not o'er so to him
 again entreat him
 kneel down before him hang upon his gown
 you are too cold if you should need a pin
 you could not with more tame a tongue desire it
 to him i say
isabella must he needs die
angelo maiden no remedy
isabella yes i do think that you might pardon him
 and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
angelo i will not do't
isabella but can you if you would
angelo look what i will not that i cannot do
isabella but might you do't and do the world no wrong
 if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
 as mine is to him
angelo he's sentenced tis too late
lucio aside to isabella you are too cold
isabella too late why no i that do speak a word
 may call it back again well believe this
 no ceremony that to great ones longs
 not the king's crown nor the deputed sword
 the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe
 become them with one half so good a grace
 as mercy does
 if he had been as you and you as he
 you would have slipt like him but he like you
 would not have been so stern
angelo pray you be gone
isabella i would to heaven i had your potency
 and you were isabel should it then be thus
 no i would tell what twere to be a judge
 and what a prisoner
lucio aside to isabella
 ay touch him there's the vein
angelo your brother is a forfeit of the law
 and you but waste your words
isabella alas alas
 why all the souls that were were forfeit once
 and he that might the vantage best have took
 found out the remedy how would you be
 if he which is the top of judgment should
 but judge you as you are o think on that
 and mercy then will breathe within your lips
 like man new made
angelo be you content fair maid
 it is the law not i condemn your brother
 were he my kinsman brother or my son
 it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow
isabella tomorrow o that's sudden spare him spare him
 he's not prepared for death even for our kitchens
 we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
 with less respect than we do minister
 to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you
 who is it that hath died for this offence
 there's many have committed it
lucio aside to isabella ay well said
angelo the law hath not been dead though it hath slept
 those many had not dared to do that evil
 if the first that did the edict infringe
 had answer'd for his deed now tis awake
 takes note of what is done and like a prophet
 looks in a glass that shows what future evils
 either new or by remissness newconceived
 and so in progress to be hatch'd and born
 are now to have no successive degrees
 but ere they live to end
isabella yet show some pity
angelo i show it most of all when i show justice
 for then i pity those i do not know
 which a dismiss'd offence would after gall
 and do him right that answering one foul wrong
 lives not to act another be satisfied
 your brother dies tomorrow be content
isabella so you must be the first that gives this sentence
 and he that suffer's o it is excellent
 to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous
 to use it like a giant
lucio aside to isabella that's well said
isabella could great men thunder
 as jove himself does jove would ne'er be quiet
 for every pelting petty officer
 would use his heaven for thunder
 nothing but thunder merciful heaven
 thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
 split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
 than the soft myrtle but man proud man
 drest in a little brief authority
 most ignorant of what he's most assured
 his glassy essence like an angry ape
 plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
 as make the angels weep who with our spleens
 would all themselves laugh mortal
lucio aside to isabella o to him to him wench he
 will relent
 he's coming i perceive t
provost aside pray heaven she win him
isabella we cannot weigh our brother with ourself
 great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
 but in the less foul profanation
lucio thou'rt i the right girl more o that
isabella that in the captain's but a choleric word
 which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
lucio aside to isabella art avised o that more on t
angelo why do you put these sayings upon me
isabella because authority though it err like others
 hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
 that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom
 knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
 that's like my brother's fault if it confess
 a natural guiltiness such as is his
 let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
 against my brother's life
angelo aside she speaks and tis
 such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well
isabella gentle my lord turn back
angelo i will bethink me come again tomorrow
isabella hark how i'll bribe you good my lord turn back
angelo how bribe me
isabella ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
lucio aside to isabella you had marr'd all else
isabella not with fond shekels of the tested gold
 or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
 as fancy values them but with true prayers
 that shall be up at heaven and enter there
 ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls
 from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
 to nothing temporal
angelo well come to me tomorrow
lucio aside to isabella go to tis well away
isabella heaven keep your honour safe
angelo aside amen
 for i am that way going to temptation
 where prayers cross
isabella at what hour tomorrow
 shall i attend your lordship
angelo at any time fore noon
isabella save your honour
 exeunt isabella lucio and provost
angelo from thee even from thy virtue
 what's this what's this is this her fault or mine
 the tempter or the tempted who sins most
 ha
 not she nor doth she tempt but it is i
 that lying by the violet in the sun
 do as the carrion does not as the flower
 corrupt with virtuous season can it be
 that modesty may more betray our sense
 than woman's lightness having waste ground enough
 shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
 and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie
 what dost thou or what art thou angelo
 dost thou desire her foully for those things
 that make her good o let her brother live
 thieves for their robbery have authority
 when judges steal themselves what do i love her
 that i desire to hear her speak again
 and feast upon her eyes what is't i dream on
 o cunning enemy that to catch a saint
 with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous
 is that temptation that doth goad us on
 to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet
 with all her double vigour art and nature
 once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
 subdues me quite even till now
 when men were fond i smiled and wonder'd how

 friar and provost
duke vincentio hail to you provost so i think you are
provost i am the provost what's your will good friar
duke vincentio bound by my charity and my blest order
 i come to visit the afflicted spirits
 here in the prison do me the common right
 to let me see them and to make me know
 the nature of their crimes that i may minister
 to them accordingly
provost i would do more than that if more were needful
 enter juliet
 look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
 who falling in the flaws of her own youth
 hath blister'd her report she is with child
 and he that got it sentenced a young man
 more fit to do another such offence
 than die for this
duke vincentio when must he die
provost as i do think tomorrow
 i have provided for you stay awhile
 to juliet
 and you shall be conducted
duke vincentio repent you fair one of the sin you carry
juliet i do and bear the shame most patiently
duke vincentio i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
 and try your penitence if it be sound
 or hollowly put on
juliet i'll gladly learn
duke vincentio love you the man that wrong'd you
juliet yes as i love the woman that wrong'd him
duke vincentio so then it seems your most offenceful act
 was mutually committed
juliet mutually
duke vincentio then was your sin of heavier kind than his
juliet i do confess it and repent it father
duke vincentio tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
 as that the sin hath brought you to this shame
 which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven
 showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
 but as we stand in fear
juliet i do repent me as it is an evil
 and take the shame with joy
duke vincentio there rest
 your partner as i hear must die tomorrow
 and i am going with instruction to him
 grace go with you benedicite

juliet must die tomorrow o injurious love
 that respites me a life whose very comfort
 is still a dying horror

scene iv a room in angelo's house
 enter angelo
angelo when i would pray and think i think and pray
 to several subjects heaven hath my empty words
 whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
 anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth
 as if i did but only chew his name
 and in my heart the strong and swelling evil
 of my conception the state whereon i studied
 is like a good thing being often read
 grown fear'd and tedious yea my gravity
 whereinlet no man hear mei take pride
 could i with boot change for an idle plume
 which the air beats for vain o place o form
 how often dost thou with thy case thy habit
 wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
 to thy false seeming blood thou art blood
 let's write good angel on the devil's horn
 tis not the devil's crest
 enter a servant
 how now who's there
servant one isabel a sister desires access to you
angelo teach her the way
 exit servant
 o heavens
 why does my blood thus muster to my heart
 making both it unable for itself
 and dispossessing all my other parts
 of necessary fitness
 so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
 come all to help him and so stop the air
 by which he should revive and even so
 the general subject to a wellwish'd king
 quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
 crowd to his presence where their untaught love
 must needs appear offence
 enter isabella
 how now fair maid
isabella i am come to know your pleasure
angelo that you might know it would much better please me
 than to demand what tis your brother cannot live
isabella even so heaven keep your honour
angelo yet may he live awhile and it may be
 as long as you or i yet he must die
isabella under your sentence
angelo yea
isabella when i beseech you that in his reprieve
 longer or shorter he may be so fitted
 that his soul sicken not
angelo ha fie these filthy vices it were as good
 to pardon him that hath from nature stolen
 a man already made as to remit
 their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
 in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy
 falsely to take away a life true made
 as to put metal in restrained means
 to make a false one
isabella tis set down so in heaven but not in earth
angelo say you so then i shall pose you quickly
 which had you rather that the most just law
 now took your brother's life or to redeem him
 give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
 as she that he hath stain'd
isabella sir believe this
 i had rather give my body than my soul
angelo i talk not of your soul our compell'd sins
 stand more for number than for accompt
isabella how say you
angelo nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak
 against the thing i say answer to this
 i now the voice of the recorded law
 pronounce a sentence on your brother's life
 might there not be a charity in sin
 to save this brother's life
isabella please you to do't
 i'll take it as a peril to my soul
 it is no sin at all but charity
angelo pleased you to do't at peril of your soul
 were equal poise of sin and charity
isabella that i do beg his life if it be sin
 heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
 if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer
 to have it added to the faults of mine
 and nothing of your answer
angelo nay but hear me
 your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant
 or seem so craftily and that's not good
isabella let me be ignorant and in nothing good
 but graciously to know i am no better
angelo thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
 when it doth tax itself as these black masks
 proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
 than beauty could display'd but mark me
 to be received plain i'll speak more gross
 your brother is to die
isabella so
angelo and his offence is so as it appears
 accountant to the law upon that pain
isabella true
angelo admit no other way to save his life
 as i subscribe not that nor any other
 but in the loss of questionthat you his sister
 finding yourself desired of such a person
 whose credit with the judge or own great place
 could fetch your brother from the manacles
 of the allbuilding law and that there were
 no earthly mean to save him but that either
 you must lay down the treasures of your body
 to this supposed or else to let him suffer
 what would you do
isabella as much for my poor brother as myself
 that is were i under the terms of death
 the impression of keen whips i'ld wear as rubies
 and strip myself to death as to a bed
 that longing have been sick for ere i'ld yield
 my body up to shame
angelo then must your brother die
isabella and twere the cheaper way
 better it were a brother died at once
 than that a sister by redeeming him
 should die for ever
angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence
 that you have slander'd so
isabella ignomy in ransom and free pardon
 are of two houses lawful mercy
 is nothing kin to foul redemption
angelo you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant
 and rather proved the sliding of your brother
 a merriment than a vice
isabella o pardon me my lord it oft falls out
 to have what we would have we speak not what we mean
 i something do excuse the thing i hate
 for his advantage that i dearly love
angelo we are all frail
isabella else let my brother die
 if not a feodary but only he
 owe and succeed thy weakness
angelo nay women are frail too
isabella ay as the glasses where they view themselves
 which are as easy broke as they make forms
 women help heaven men their creation mar
 in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail
 for we are soft as our complexions are
 and credulous to false prints
angelo i think it well
 and from this testimony of your own sex
 since i suppose we are made to be no stronger
 than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold
 i do arrest your words be that you are
 that is a woman if you be more you're none
 if you be one as you are well express'd
 by all external warrants show it now
 by putting on the destined livery
isabella i have no tongue but one gentle my lord
 let me entreat you speak the former language
angelo plainly conceive i love you
isabella my brother did love juliet
 and you tell me that he shall die for it
angelo he shall not isabel if you give me love
isabella i know your virtue hath a licence in't
 which seems a little fouler than it is
 to pluck on others
angelo believe me on mine honour
 my words express my purpose
isabella ha little honour to be much believed
 and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming
 i will proclaim thee angelo look for't
 sign me a present pardon for my brother
 or with an outstretch'd throat i'll tell the world aloud
 what man thou art
angelo who will believe thee isabel
 my unsoil'd name the austereness of my life
 my vouch against you and my place i the state
 will so your accusation overweigh
 that you shall stifle in your own report
 and smell of calumny i have begun
 and now i give my sensual race the rein
 fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
 lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
 that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
 by yielding up thy body to my will
 or else he must not only die the death
 but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
 to lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow
 or by the affection that now guides me most
 i'll prove a tyrant to him as for you
 say what you can my false o'erweighs your true
 exit
isabella to whom should i complain did i tell this
 who would believe me o perilous mouths
 that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
 either of condemnation or approof
 bidding the law make court'sy to their will
 hooking both right and wrong to the appetite
 to follow as it draws i'll to my brother
 though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
 yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
 that had he twenty heads to tender down
 on twenty bloody blocks he'ld yield them up
 before his sister should her body stoop
 to such abhorr'd pollution
 then isabel live chaste and brother die
 more than our brother is our chastity
 i'll tell him yet of angelo's request
 and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest

act iii
scene i a room in the prison
 enter duke vincentio disguised as before claudio
 and provost
duke vincentio so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo
claudio the miserable have no other medicine
 but only hope
 i've hope to live and am prepared to die
duke vincentio be absolute for death either death or life
 shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life
 if i do lose thee i do lose a thing
 that none but fools would keep a breath thou art
 servile to all the skyey influences
 that dost this habitation where thou keep'st
 hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool
 for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
 and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble
 for all the accommodations that thou bear'st
 are nursed by baseness thou'rt by no means valiant
 for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
 of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep
 and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fear'st
 thy death which is no more thou art not thyself
 for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
 that issue out of dust happy thou art not
 for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get
 and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain
 for thy complexion shifts to strange effects
 after the moon if thou art rich thou'rt poor
 for like an ass whose back with ingots bows
 thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey
 and death unloads thee friend hast thou none
 for thine own bowels which do call thee sire
 the mere effusion of thy proper loins
 do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
 for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age
 but as it were an afterdinner's sleep
 dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
 becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
 of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
 thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
 to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this
 that bears the name of life yet in this life
 lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear
 that makes these odds all even
claudio i humbly thank you
 to sue to live i find i seek to die
 and seeking death find life let it come on
isabella within what ho peace here grace and good company
provost who's there come in the wish deserves a welcome
duke vincentio dear sir ere long i'll visit you again
claudio most holy sir i thank you
 enter isabella
isabella my business is a word or two with claudio
provost and very welcome look signior here's your sister
duke vincentio provost a word with you
provost as many as you please
duke vincentio bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed
 exeunt duke vincentio and provost
claudio now sister what's the comfort
isabella why
 as all comforts are most good most good indeed
 lord angelo having affairs to heaven
 intends you for his swift ambassador
 where you shall be an everlasting leiger
 therefore your best appointment make with speed
 tomorrow you set on
claudio is there no remedy
isabella none but such remedy as to save a head
 to cleave a heart in twain
claudio but is there any
isabella yes brother you may live
 there is a devilish mercy in the judge
 if you'll implore it that will free your life
 but fetter you till death
claudio perpetual durance
isabella ay just perpetual durance a restraint
 though all the world's vastidity you had
 to a determined scope
claudio but in what nature
isabella in such a one as you consenting to't
 would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
 and leave you naked
claudio let me know the point
isabella o i do fear thee claudio and i quake
 lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
 and six or seven winters more respect
 than a perpetual honour darest thou die
 the sense of death is most in apprehension
 and the poor beetle that we tread upon
 in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
 as when a giant dies
claudio why give you me this shame
 think you i can a resolution fetch
 from flowery tenderness if i must die
 i will encounter darkness as a bride
 and hug it in mine arms
isabella there spake my brother there my father's grave
 did utter forth a voice yes thou must die
 thou art too noble to conserve a life
 in base appliances this outwardsainted deputy
 whose settled visage and deliberate word
 nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew
 as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
 his filth within being cast he would appear
 a pond as deep as hell
claudio the prenzie angelo
isabella o tis the cunning livery of hell
 the damned'st body to invest and cover
 in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio
 if i would yield him my virginity
 thou mightst be freed
claudio o heavens it cannot be
isabella yes he would give't thee from this rank offence
 so to offend him still this night's the time
 that i should do what i abhor to name
 or else thou diest tomorrow
claudio thou shalt not do't
isabella o were it but my life
 i'ld throw it down for your deliverance
 as frankly as a pin
claudio thanks dear isabel
isabella be ready claudio for your death tomorrow
claudio yes has he affections in him
 that thus can make him bite the law by the nose
 when he would force it sure it is no sin
 or of the deadly seven it is the least
isabella which is the least
claudio if it were damnable he being so wise
 why would he for the momentary trick
 be perdurably fined o isabel
isabella what says my brother
claudio death is a fearful thing
isabella and shamed life a hateful
claudio ay but to die and go we know not where
 to lie in cold obstruction and to rot
 this sensible warm motion to become
 a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
 to bathe in fiery floods or to reside
 in thrilling region of thickribbed ice
 to be imprison'd in the viewless winds
 and blown with restless violence round about
 the pendent world or to be worse than worst
 of those that lawless and incertain thought
 imagine howling tis too horrible
 the weariest and most loathed worldly life
 that age ache penury and imprisonment
 can lay on nature is a paradise
 to what we fear of death
isabella alas alas
claudio sweet sister let me live
 what sin you do to save a brother's life
 nature dispenses with the deed so far
 that it becomes a virtue
isabella o you beast
 o faithless coward o dishonest wretch
 wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
 is't not a kind of incest to take life
 from thine own sister's shame what should i think
 heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair
 for such a warped slip of wilderness
 ne'er issued from his blood take my defiance
 die perish might but my bending down
 reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
 i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death
 no word to save thee
claudio nay hear me isabel
isabella o fie fie fie
 thy sin's not accidental but a trade
 mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
 tis best thou diest quickly
claudio o hear me isabella
 reenter duke vincentio
duke vincentio vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
isabella what is your will
duke vincentio might you dispense with your leisure i would by and
 by have some speech with you the satisfaction i
 would require is likewise your own benefit
isabella i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be
 stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile
 walks apart
duke vincentio son i have overheard what hath passed between you
 and your sister angelo had never the purpose to
 corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her
 virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
 of natures she having the truth of honour in her
 hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
 glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i
 know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to
 death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
 that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to
 your knees and make ready
claudio let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love
 with life that i will sue to be rid of it
duke vincentio hold you there farewell
 exit claudio
 provost a word with you
 reenter provost
provost what's your will father
duke vincentio that now you are come you will be gone leave me
 awhile with the maid my mind promises with my
 habit no loss shall touch her by my company
provost in good time
 exit provost isabella comes forward
duke vincentio the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good
 the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
 brief in goodness but grace being the soul of
 your complexion shall keep the body of it ever
 fair the assault that angelo hath made to you
 fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but
 that frailty hath examples for his falling i should
 wonder at angelo how will you do to content this
 substitute and to save your brother
isabella i am now going to resolve him i had rather my
 brother die by the law than my son should be
 unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke
 deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can
 speak to him i will open my lips in vain or
 discover his government
duke vincentio that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter
 now stands he will avoid your accusation he made
 trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my
 advisings to the love i have in doing good a
 remedy presents itself i do make myself believe
 that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
 lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from
 the angry law do no stain to your own gracious
 person and much please the absent duke if
 peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
 this business
isabella let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do
 anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit
duke vincentio virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have
 you not heard speak of mariana the sister of
 frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea
isabella i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name
duke vincentio she should this angelo have married was affianced
 to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between
 which time of the contract and limit of the
 solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea
 having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
 sister but mark how heavily this befell to the
 poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and
 renowned brother in his love toward her ever most
 kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
 her fortune her marriagedowry with both her
 combinate husband this wellseeming angelo
isabella can this be so did angelo so leave her
duke vincentio left her in her tears and dried not one of them
 with his comfort swallowed his vows whole
 pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few
 bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet
 wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears
 is washed with them but relents not
isabella what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
 from the world what corruption in this life that
 it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail
duke vincentio it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the
 cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps
 you from dishonour in doing it
isabella show me how good father
duke vincentio this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
 of her first affection his unjust unkindness that
 in all reason should have quenched her love hath
 like an impediment in the current made it more
 violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his
 requiring with a plausible obedience agree with
 his demands to the point only refer yourself to
 this advantage first that your stay with him may
 not be long that the time may have all shadow and
 silence in it and the place answer to convenience
 this being granted in courseand now follows
 allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
 your appointment go in your place if the encounter
 acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to
 her recompense and here by this is your brother
 saved your honour untainted the poor mariana
 advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid
 will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you
 think well to carry this as you may the doubleness
 of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof
 what think you of it
isabella the image of it gives me content already and i
 trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection
duke vincentio it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily
 to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his
 bed give him promise of satisfaction i will
 presently to saint luke's there at the moated
 grange resides this dejected mariana at that
 place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that
 it may be quickly
isabella i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father

 what news friar of the duke
duke vincentio i know none can you tell me of any
lucio some say he is with the emperor of russia other
 some he is in rome but where is he think you
duke vincentio i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well
lucio it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
 the state and usurp the beggary he was never born
 to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he
 puts transgression to t
duke vincentio he does well in t
lucio a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
 him something too crabbed that way friar
duke vincentio it is too general a vice and severity must cure it
lucio yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred
 it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp
 it quite friar till eating and drinking be put
 down they say this angelo was not made by man and
 woman after this downright way of creation is it
 true think you
duke vincentio how should he be made then
lucio some report a seamaid spawned him some that he
 was begot between two stockfishes but it is
 certain that when he makes water his urine is
 congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a
 motion generative that's infallible
duke vincentio you are pleasant sir and speak apace
lucio why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the
 rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
 man would the duke that is absent have done this
 ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
 hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing
 a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he
 knew the service and that instructed him to mercy
duke vincentio i never heard the absent duke much detected for
 women he was not inclined that way
lucio o sir you are deceived
duke vincentio tis not possible
lucio who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and
 his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish the
 duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too
 that let me inform you
duke vincentio you do him wrong surely
lucio sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the
 duke and i believe i know the cause of his
 withdrawing
duke vincentio what i prithee might be the cause
lucio no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the
 teeth and the lips but this i can let you
 understand the greater file of the subject held the
 duke to be wise
duke vincentio wise why no question but he was
lucio a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
duke vincentio either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking
 the very stream of his life and the business he hath
 helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
 proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own
 bringingsforth and he shall appear to the
 envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier
 therefore you speak unskilfully or if your
 knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice
lucio sir i know him and i love him
duke vincentio love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with
 dearer love
lucio come sir i know what i know
duke vincentio i can hardly believe that since you know not what
 you speak but if ever the duke return as our
 prayers are he may let me desire you to make your
 answer before him if it be honest you have spoke
 you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call
 upon you and i pray you your name
lucio sir my name is lucio well known to the duke
duke vincentio he shall know you better sir if i may live to
 report you
lucio i fear you not
duke vincentio o you hope the duke will return no more or you
 imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i
 can do you little harm you'll forswear this again
lucio i'll be hanged first thou art deceived in me
 friar but no more of this canst thou tell if
 claudio die tomorrow or no
duke vincentio why should he die sir
lucio why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would
 the duke we talk of were returned again the
 ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
 continency sparrows must not build in his
 houseeaves because they are lecherous the duke
 yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would

 enter escalus provost and officers with mistress overdone
escalus go away with her to prison
mistress overdone good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted
 a merciful man good my lord
escalus double and treble admonition and still forfeit in
 the same kind this would make mercy swear and play
 the tyrant
provost a bawd of eleven years continuance may it please
 your honour
mistress overdone my lord this is one lucio's information against me
 mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the
 duke's time he promised her marriage his child
 is a year and a quarter old come philip and jacob
 i have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me
escalus that fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be
 called before us away with her to prison go to
 no more words
 exeunt officers with mistress overdone
 provost my brother angelo will not be altered
 claudio must die tomorrow let him be furnished
 with divines and have all charitable preparation
 if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be
 so with him
provost so please you this friar hath been with him and
 advised him for the entertainment of death
escalus good even good father
duke vincentio bliss and goodness on you
escalus of whence are you
duke vincentio not of this country though my chance is now
 to use it for my time i am a brother
 of gracious order late come from the see
 in special business from his holiness
escalus what news abroad i the world
duke vincentio none but that there is so great a fever on
 goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it
 novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous
 to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous
 to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce
 truth enough alive to make societies secure but
 security enough to make fellowships accurst much
 upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this
 news is old enough yet it is every day's news i
 pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
escalus one that above all other strifes contended
 especially to know himself
duke vincentio what pleasure was he given to
escalus rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
 any thing which professed to make him rejoice a
 gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to
 his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous
 and let me desire to know how you find claudio
 prepared i am made to understand that you have
 lent him visitation
duke vincentio he professes to have received no sinister measure
 from his judge but most willingly humbles himself
 to the determination of justice yet had he framed
 to himself by the instruction of his frailty many
 deceiving promises of life which i by my good
 leisure have discredited to him and now is he
 resolved to die
escalus you have paid the heavens your function and the
 prisoner the very debt of your calling i have
 laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
 shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i
 found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
 he is indeed justice
duke vincentio if his own life answer the straitness of his
 proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he
 chance to fail he hath sentenced himself
escalus i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well
duke vincentio peace be with you
 exeunt escalus and provost
 he who the sword of heaven will bear
 should be as holy as severe
 pattern in himself to know
 grace to stand and virtue go
 more nor less to others paying
 than by selfoffences weighing
 shame to him whose cruel striking
 kills for faults of his own liking
 twice treble shame on angelo
 to weed my vice and let his grow
 o what may man within him hide
 though angel on the outward side
 how may likeness made in crimes
 making practise on the times
 to draw with idle spiders strings
 most ponderous and substantial things
 craft against vice i must apply
 with angelo tonight shall lie
 his old betrothed but despised
 so disguise shall by the disguised
 pay with falsehood false exacting

provost what comfort is for claudio
duke vincentio there's some in hope
provost it is a bitter deputy
duke vincentio not so not so his life is parallel'd
 even with the stroke and line of his great justice
 he doth with holy abstinence subdue
 that in himself which he spurs on his power
 to qualify in others were he meal'd with that
 which he corrects then were he tyrannous
 but this being so he's just
 knocking within
 now are they come
 exit provost
 this is a gentle provost seldom when
 the steeled gaoler is the friend of men
 knocking within

 reenter provost

duke vincentio as near the dawning provost as it is
 you shall hear more ere morning
provost happily
 you something know yet i believe there comes
 no countermand no such example have we
 besides upon the very siege of justice
 lord angelo hath to the public ear
 profess'd the contrary
 enter a messenger
 this is his lordship's man
duke vincentio and here comes claudio's pardon
messenger giving a paper
 my lord hath sent you this note and by me this
 further charge that you swerve not from the
 smallest article of it neither in time matter or
 other circumstance good morrow for as i take it
 it is almost day
provost i shall obey him
 exit messenger
duke vincentio aside this is his pardon purchased by such sin
 for which the pardoner himself is in
 hence hath offence his quick celerity
 when it is born in high authority
 when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended
 that for the fault's love is the offender friended
 now sir what news
provost i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss
 in mine office awakens me with this unwonted
 puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before
duke vincentio pray you let's hear
provost reads
 whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let
 claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the
 afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction
 let me have claudio's head sent me by five let
 this be duly performed with a thought that more
 depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail
 not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril'
 what say you to this sir
duke vincentio what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the
 afternoon
provost a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one
 that is a prisoner nine years old
duke vincentio how came it that the absent duke had not either
 delivered him to his liberty or executed him i
 have heard it was ever his manner to do so
provost his friends still wrought reprieves for him and
 indeed his fact till now in the government of lord
 angelo came not to an undoubtful proof
duke vincentio it is now apparent
provost most manifest and not denied by himself
duke vincentio hath he born himself penitently in prison how
 seems he to be touched
provost a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
 as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless
 of what's past present or to come insensible of
 mortality and desperately mortal
duke vincentio he wants advice
provost he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty
 of the prison give him leave to escape hence he
 would not drunk many times a day if not many days
 entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if
 to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming
 warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
duke vincentio more of him anon there is written in your brow
 provost honesty and constancy if i read it not
 truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the
 boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard
 claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is
 no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath
 sentenced him to make you understand this in a
 manifested effect i crave but four days respite
 for the which you are to do me both a present and a
 dangerous courtesy
provost pray sir in what
duke vincentio in the delaying death
provost a lack how may i do it having the hour limited
 and an express command under penalty to deliver
 his head in the view of angelo i may make my case
 as claudio's to cross this in the smallest
duke vincentio by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my
 instructions may be your guide let this barnardine
 be this morning executed and his head born to angelo
provost angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
duke vincentio o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it
 shave the head and tie the beard and say it was
 the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
 death you know the course is common if any thing
 fall to you upon this more than thanks and good
 fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead
 against it with my life
provost pardon me good father it is against my oath
duke vincentio were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
provost to him and to his substitutes
duke vincentio you will think you have made no offence if the duke
 avouch the justice of your dealing
provost but what likelihood is in that
duke vincentio not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see
 you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor
 persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go
 further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you
 look you sir here is the hand and seal of the
 duke you know the character i doubt not and the
 signet is not strange to you
provost i know them both
duke vincentio the contents of this is the return of the duke you
 shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you
 shall find within these two days he will be here
 this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this
 very day receives letters of strange tenor
 perchance of the duke's death perchance entering
 into some monastery but by chance nothing of what
 is writ look the unfolding star calls up the
 shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these
 things should be all difficulties are but easy
 when they are known call your executioner and off
 with barnardine's head i will give him a present
 shrift and advise him for a better place yet you
 are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you
 come away it is almost clear dawn

duke vincentio away with her poor soul
 she speaks this in the infirmity of sense
isabella o prince i conjure thee as thou believest
 there is another comfort than this world
 that thou neglect me not with that opinion
 that i am touch'd with madness make not impossible
 that which but seems unlike tis not impossible
 but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground
 may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
 as angelo even so may angelo
 in all his dressings characts titles forms
 be an archvillain believe it royal prince
 if he be less he's nothing but he's more
 had i more name for badness
duke vincentio by mine honesty
 if she be madas i believe no other
 her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
 such a dependency of thing on thing
 as e'er i heard in madness
isabella o gracious duke
 harp not on that nor do not banish reason
 for inequality but let your reason serve
 to make the truth appear where it seems hid
 and hide the false seems true
duke vincentio many that are not mad
 have sure more lack of reason what would you say
isabella i am the sister of one claudio
 condemn'd upon the act of fornication
 to lose his head condemn'd by angelo
 i in probation of a sisterhood
 was sent to by my brother one lucio
 as then the messenger
lucio that's i an't like your grace
 i came to her from claudio and desired her
 to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo
 for her poor brother's pardon
isabella that's he indeed
duke vincentio you were not bid to speak
lucio no my good lord
 nor wish'd to hold my peace
duke vincentio i wish you now then
 pray you take note of it and when you have
 a business for yourself pray heaven you then
 be perfect
lucio i warrant your honour
duke vincentio the warrants for yourself take heed to't
isabella this gentleman told somewhat of my tale
lucio right
duke vincentio it may be right but you are i the wrong
 to speak before your time proceed
isabella i went
 to this pernicious caitiff deputy
duke vincentio that's somewhat madly spoken
isabella pardon it
 the phrase is to the matter
duke vincentio mended again the matter proceed
isabella in brief to set the needless process by
 how i persuaded how i pray'd and kneel'd
 how he refell'd me and how i replied
 for this was of much lengththe vile conclusion
 i now begin with grief and shame to utter
 he would not but by gift of my chaste body
 to his concupiscible intemperate lust
 release my brother and after much debatement
 my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
 and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes
 his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
 for my poor brother's head
duke vincentio this is most likely
isabella o that it were as like as it is true
duke vincentio by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speak'st
 or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
 in hateful practise first his integrity
 stands without blemish next it imports no reason
 that with such vehemency he should pursue
 faults proper to himself if he had so offended
 he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
 and not have cut him off some one hath set you on
 confess the truth and say by whose advice
 thou camest here to complain
isabella and is this all
 then o you blessed ministers above
 keep me in patience and with ripen'd time
 unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
 in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe
 as i thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go
duke vincentio i know you'ld fain be gone an officer
 to prison with her shall we thus permit
 a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
 on him so near us this needs must be a practise
 who knew of your intent and coming hither
isabella one that i would were here friar lodowick
duke vincentio a ghostly father belike who knows that lodowick
lucio my lord i know him tis a meddling friar
 i do not like the man had he been lay my lord
 for certain words he spake against your grace
 in your retirement i had swinged him soundly
duke vincentio words against me this is a good friar belike
 and to set on this wretched woman here
 against our substitute let this friar be found
lucio but yesternight my lord she and that friar
 i saw them at the prison a saucy friar
 a very scurvy fellow
friar peter blessed be your royal grace
 i have stood by my lord and i have heard
 your royal ear abused first hath this woman
 most wrongfully accused your substitute
 who is as free from touch or soil with her
 as she from one ungot
duke vincentio we did believe no less
 know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of
friar peter i know him for a man divine and holy
 not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
 as he's reported by this gentleman
 and on my trust a man that never yet
 did as he vouches misreport your grace
lucio my lord most villanously believe it
friar peter well he in time may come to clear himself
 but at this instant he is sick my lord
 of a strange fever upon his mere request
 being come to knowledge that there was complaint
 intended gainst lord angelo came i hither
 to speak as from his mouth what he doth know
 is true and false and what he with his oath
 and all probation will make up full clear
 whensoever he's convented first for this woman
 to justify this worthy nobleman
 so vulgarly and personally accused
 her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
 till she herself confess it
duke vincentio good friar let's hear it
 isabella is carried off guarded and mariana comes forward
 do you not smile at this lord angelo
 o heaven the vanity of wretched fools
 give us some seats come cousin angelo
 in this i'll be impartial be you judge
 of your own cause is this the witness friar
 first let her show her face and after speak
mariana pardon my lord i will not show my face
 until my husband bid me
duke vincentio what are you married
mariana no my lord
duke vincentio are you a maid
mariana no my lord
duke vincentio a widow then
mariana neither my lord
duke vincentio why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife
lucio my lord she may be a punk for many of them are
 neither maid widow nor wife
duke vincentio silence that fellow i would he had some cause
 to prattle for himself
lucio well my lord
mariana my lord i do confess i ne'er was married
 and i confess besides i am no maid
 i have known my husband yet my husband
 knows not that ever he knew me
lucio he was drunk then my lord it can be no better
duke vincentio for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
lucio well my lord
duke vincentio this is no witness for lord angelo
mariana now i come to't my lord
 she that accuses him of fornication
 in selfsame manner doth accuse my husband
 and charges him my lord with such a time
 when i'll depose i had him in mine arms
 with all the effect of love
angelo charges she more than me
mariana not that i know
duke vincentio no you say your husband
mariana why just my lord and that is angelo
 who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body
 but knows he thinks that he knows isabel's
angelo this is a strange abuse let's see thy face
mariana my husband bids me now i will unmask
 unveiling
 this is that face thou cruel angelo
 which once thou sworest was worth the looking on
 this is the hand which with a vow'd contract
 was fast belock'd in thine this is the body
 that took away the match from isabel
 and did supply thee at thy gardenhouse
 in her imagined person
duke vincentio know you this woman
lucio carnally she says
duke vincentio sirrah no more
lucio enough my lord
angelo my lord i must confess i know this woman
 and five years since there was some speech of marriage
 betwixt myself and her which was broke off
 partly for that her promised proportions
 came short of composition but in chief
 for that her reputation was disvalued
 in levity since which time of five years
 i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
 upon my faith and honour
mariana noble prince
 as there comes light from heaven and words from breath
 as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
 i am affianced this man's wife as strongly
 as words could make up vows and my good lord
 but tuesday night last gone in's gardenhouse
 he knew me as a wife as this is true
 let me in safety raise me from my knees
 or else for ever be confixed here
 a marble monument
angelo i did but smile till now
 now good my lord give me the scope of justice
 my patience here is touch'd i do perceive
 these poor informal women are no more
 but instruments of some more mightier member
 that sets them on let me have way my lord
 to find this practise out
duke vincentio ay with my heart
 and punish them to your height of pleasure
 thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman
 compact with her that's gone think'st thou thy oaths
 though they would swear down each particular saint
 were testimonies against his worth and credit
 that's seal'd in approbation you lord escalus
 sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
 to find out this abuse whence tis derived
 there is another friar that set them on
 let him be sent for
friar peter would he were here my lord for he indeed
 hath set the women on to this complaint

 and he may fetch him
duke vincentio go do it instantly

 and put your trial in the villain's mouth
 which here you come to accuse
lucio this is the rascal this is he i spoke of
escalus why thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar
 is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
 to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
 and in the witness of his proper ear
 to call him villain and then to glance from him
 to the duke himself to tax him with injustice
 take him hence to the rack with him we'll touse you
 joint by joint but we will know his purpose
 what unjust'
duke vincentio be not so hot the duke
 dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
 dare rack his own his subject am i not

 but faults so countenanced that the strong statutes
 stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop
 as much in mock as mark

angelo what can you vouch against him signior lucio
 is this the man that you did tell us of
lucio tis he my lord come hither goodman baldpate

 met you at the prison in the absence of the duke
lucio o did you so and do you remember what you said of the duke

lucio do you so sir and was the duke a fleshmonger a
 fool and a coward as you then reported him to be
duke vincentio you must sir change persons with me ere you make
 that my report you indeed spoke so of him and
 much more much worse
lucio o thou damnable fellow did not i pluck thee by the
 nose for thy speeches
duke vincentio i protest i love the duke as i love myself
angelo hark how the villain would close now after his
 treasonable abuses
escalus such a fellow is not to be talked withal away with

 first provost let me bail these gentle three
 to lucio
 sneak not away sir for the friar and you

duke vincentio to escalus what you have spoke i pardon sit you down

 to angelo
 sir by your leave
 hast thou or word or wit or impudence
 that yet can do thee office if thou hast
 rely upon it till my tale be heard

angelo o my dread lord
 i should be guiltier than my guiltiness
 to think i can be undiscernible
 when i perceive your grace like power divine
 hath look'd upon my passes then good prince
 no longer session hold upon my shame
 but let my trial be mine own confession
 immediate sentence then and sequent death
 is all the grace i beg
duke vincentio come hither mariana
 say wast thou e'er contracted to this woman
angelo i was my lord
duke vincentio go take her hence and marry her instantly
 do you the office friar which consummate
 return him here again go with him provost
 exeunt angelo mariana friar peter and provost
escalus my lord i am more amazed at his dishonour
 than at the strangeness of it
duke vincentio come hither isabel
 your friar is now your prince as i was then
 advertising and holy to your business
 not changing heart with habit i am still
 attorney'd at your service
isabella o give me pardon
 that i your vassal have employ'd and pain'd
 your unknown sovereignty
duke vincentio you are pardon'd isabel
 and now dear maid be you as free to us
 your brother's death i know sits at your heart
 and you may marvel why i obscured myself
 labouring to save his life and would not rather
 make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
 than let him so be lost o most kind maid
 it was the swift celerity of his death
 which i did think with slower foot came on
 that brain'd my purpose but peace be with him
 that life is better life past fearing death
 than that which lives to fear make it your comfort
 so happy is your brother
isabella i do my lord
 reenter angelo mariana friar peter and provost
duke vincentio for this newmarried man approaching here
 whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
 your well defended honour you must pardon
 for mariana's sake but as he adjudged your brother
 being criminal in double violation
 of sacred chastity and of promisebreach
 thereon dependent for your brother's life
 the very mercy of the law cries out
 most audible even from his proper tongue
 an angelo for claudio death for death'
 haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
 like doth quit like and measure still for measure
 then angelo thy fault's thus manifested
 which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
 we do condemn thee to the very block
 where claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste
 away with him
mariana o my most gracious lord
 i hope you will not mock me with a husband
duke vincentio it is your husband mock'd you with a husband
 consenting to the safeguard of your honour
 i thought your marriage fit else imputation
 for that he knew you might reproach your life
 and choke your good to come for his possessions
 although by confiscation they are ours
 we do instate and widow you withal
 to buy you a better husband
mariana o my dear lord
 i crave no other nor no better man
duke vincentio never crave him we are definitive
mariana gentle my liege
 kneeling
duke vincentio you do but lose your labour
 away with him to death
 to lucio
 now sir to you
mariana o my good lord sweet isabel take my part
 lend me your knees and all my life to come
 i'll lend you all my life to do you service
duke vincentio against all sense you do importune her
 should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
 her brother's ghost his paved bed would break
 and take her hence in horror
mariana isabel
 sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me
 hold up your hands say nothing i'll speak all
 they say best men are moulded out of faults
 and for the most become much more the better
 for being a little bad so may my husband
 o isabel will you not lend a knee
duke vincentio he dies for claudio's death
isabella most bounteous sir
 kneeling
 look if it please you on this man condemn'd
 as if my brother lived i partly think
 a due sincerity govern'd his deeds
 till he did look on me since it is so
 let him not die my brother had but justice
 in that he did the thing for which he died
 for angelo
 his act did not o'ertake his bad intent
 and must be buried but as an intent
 that perish'd by the way thoughts are no subjects
 intents but merely thoughts
mariana merely my lord
duke vincentio your suit's unprofitable stand up i say
 i have bethought me of another fault
 provost how came it claudio was beheaded
 at an unusual hour
provost it was commanded so
duke vincentio had you a special warrant for the deed
provost no my good lord it was by private message
duke vincentio for which i do discharge you of your office
 give up your keys
provost pardon me noble lord
 i thought it was a fault but knew it not
 yet did repent me after more advice
 for testimony whereof one in the prison
 that should by private order else have died
 i have reserved alive
duke vincentio what's he
provost his name is barnardine
duke vincentio i would thou hadst done so by claudio
 go fetch him hither let me look upon him
 exit provost
escalus i am sorry one so learned and so wise
 as you lord angelo have still appear'd
 should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
 and lack of temper'd judgment afterward
angelo i am sorry that such sorrow i procure
 and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
 that i crave death more willingly than mercy
 tis my deserving and i do entreat it
 reenter provost with barnardine claudio muffled
 and juliet
duke vincentio which is that barnardine
provost this my lord
duke vincentio there was a friar told me of this man
 sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
 that apprehends no further than this world
 and squarest thy life according thou'rt condemn'd
 but for those earthly faults i quit them all
 and pray thee take this mercy to provide
 for better times to come friar advise him
 i leave him to your hand what muffled fellow's that
provost this is another prisoner that i saved
 who should have died when claudio lost his head
 as like almost to claudio as himself
 unmuffles claudio
duke vincentio to isabella if he be like your brother for his sake
 is he pardon'd and for your lovely sake
 give me your hand and say you will be mine
 he is my brother too but fitter time for that
 by this lord angelo perceives he's safe
 methinks i see a quickening in his eye
 well angelo your evil quits you well
 look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
 i find an apt remission in myself
 and yet here's one in place i cannot pardon
 to lucio
 you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward
 one all of luxury an ass a madman
 wherein have i so deserved of you
 that you extol me thus
lucio faith my lord i spoke it but according to the
 trick if you will hang me for it you may but i
 had rather it would please you i might be whipt
duke vincentio whipt first sir and hanged after
 proclaim it provost round about the city
 is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow
 as i have heard him swear himself there's one
 whom he begot with child let her appear
 and he shall marry her the nuptial finish'd
 let him be whipt and hang'd
lucio i beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore
 your highness said even now i made you a duke
 good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold
duke vincentio upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
 thy slanders i forgive and therewithal
 remit thy other forfeits take him to prison
 and see our pleasure herein executed
lucio marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death
 whipping and hanging
duke vincentio slandering a prince deserves it
 exit officers with lucio
 she claudio that you wrong'd look you restore
 joy to you mariana love her angelo
 i have confess'd her and i know her virtue
 thanks good friend escalus for thy much goodness
 there's more behind that is more gratulate
 thanks provost for thy care and secrecy
 we shill employ thee in a worthier place
 forgive him angelo that brought you home
 the head of ragozine for claudio's
 the offence pardons itself dear isabel
 i have a motion much imports your good
 whereto if you'll a willing ear incline
 what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine
 so bring us to our palace where we'll show
 what's yet behind that's meet you all should know

 enter antonio salarino and salanio
antonio in sooth i know not why i am so sad
 it wearies me you say it wearies you
 but how i caught it found it or came by it
 what stuff tis made of whereof it is born
 i am to learn
 and such a wantwit sadness makes of me
 that i have much ado to know myself
salarino your mind is tossing on the ocean
 there where your argosies with portly sail
 like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
 or as it were the pageants of the sea
 do overpeer the petty traffickers
 that curtsy to them do them reverence
 as they fly by them with their woven wings
salanio believe me sir had i such venture forth
 the better part of my affections would
 be with my hopes abroad i should be still
 plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
 peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
 and every object that might make me fear
 misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
 would make me sad
salarino my wind cooling my broth
 would blow me to an ague when i thought
 what harm a wind too great at sea might do
 i should not see the sandy hourglass run
 but i should think of shallows and of flats
 and see my wealthy andrew dock'd in sand
 vailing her hightop lower than her ribs
 to kiss her burial should i go to church
 and see the holy edifice of stone
 and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
 which touching but my gentle vessel's side
 would scatter all her spices on the stream
 enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
 and in a word but even now worth this
 and now worth nothing shall i have the thought
 to think on this and shall i lack the thought
 that such a thing bechanced would make me sad
 but tell not me i know antonio
 is sad to think upon his merchandise
antonio believe me no i thank my fortune for it
 my ventures are not in one bottom trusted
 nor to one place nor is my whole estate
 upon the fortune of this present year
 therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
salarino why then you are in love
antonio fie fie
salarino not in love neither then let us say you are sad
 because you are not merry and twere as easy
 for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
 because you are not sad now by twoheaded janus
 nature hath framed strange fellows in her time
 some that will evermore peep through their eyes
 and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper
 and other of such vinegar aspect
 that they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
 though nestor swear the jest be laughable
 enter bassanio lorenzo and gratiano
salanio here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman
 gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well
 we leave you now with better company
salarino i would have stay'd till i had made you merry
 if worthier friends had not prevented me
antonio your worth is very dear in my regard
 i take it your own business calls on you
 and you embrace the occasion to depart
salarino good morrow my good lords
bassanio good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
 you grow exceeding strange must it be so
salarino we'll make our leisures to attend on yours
 exeunt salarino and salanio
lorenzo my lord bassanio since you have found antonio
 we two will leave you but at dinnertime
 i pray you have in mind where we must meet
bassanio i will not fail you
gratiano you look not well signior antonio
 you have too much respect upon the world
 they lose it that do buy it with much care
 believe me you are marvellously changed
antonio i hold the world but as the world gratiano
 a stage where every man must play a part
 and mine a sad one
gratiano let me play the fool
 with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
 and let my liver rather heat with wine
 than my heart cool with mortifying groans
 why should a man whose blood is warm within
 sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
 sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
 by being peevish i tell thee what antonio
 i love thee and it is my love that speaks
 there are a sort of men whose visages
 do cream and mantle like a standing pond
 and do a wilful stillness entertain
 with purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
 of wisdom gravity profound conceit
 as who should say i am sir oracle
 and when i ope my lips let no dog bark'
 o my antonio i do know of these
 that therefore only are reputed wise
 for saying nothing when i am very sure
 if they should speak would almost damn those ears
 which hearing them would call their brothers fools
 i'll tell thee more of this another time
 but fish not with this melancholy bait
 for this fool gudgeon this opinion
 come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile
 i'll end my exhortation after dinner
lorenzo well we will leave you then till dinnertime
 i must be one of these same dumb wise men
 for gratiano never lets me speak
gratiano well keep me company but two years moe
 thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
antonio farewell i'll grow a talker for this gear
gratiano thanks i faith for silence is only commendable
 in a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
 exeunt gratiano and lorenzo
antonio is that any thing now
bassanio gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more
 than any man in all venice his reasons are as two
 grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you
 shall seek all day ere you find them and when you
 have them they are not worth the search
antonio well tell me now what lady is the same
 to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
 that you today promised to tell me of
bassanio tis not unknown to you antonio
 how much i have disabled mine estate
 by something showing a more swelling port
 than my faint means would grant continuance
 nor do i now make moan to be abridged
 from such a noble rate but my chief care
 is to come fairly off from the great debts
 wherein my time something too prodigal
 hath left me gaged to you antonio
 i owe the most in money and in love
 and from your love i have a warranty
 to unburden all my plots and purposes
 how to get clear of all the debts i owe
antonio i pray you good bassanio let me know it
 and if it stand as you yourself still do
 within the eye of honour be assured
 my purse my person my extremest means
 lie all unlock'd to your occasions
bassanio in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft
 i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight
 the selfsame way with more advised watch
 to find the other forth and by adventuring both
 i oft found both i urge this childhood proof
 because what follows is pure innocence
 i owe you much and like a wilful youth
 that which i owe is lost but if you please
 to shoot another arrow that self way
 which you did shoot the first i do not doubt
 as i will watch the aim or to find both
 or bring your latter hazard back again
 and thankfully rest debtor for the first
antonio you know me well and herein spend but time
 to wind about my love with circumstance
 and out of doubt you do me now more wrong
 in making question of my uttermost
 than if you had made waste of all i have
 then do but say to me what i should do
 that in your knowledge may by me be done
 and i am prest unto it therefore speak
bassanio in belmont is a lady richly left
 and she is fair and fairer than that word
 of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
 i did receive fair speechless messages
 her name is portia nothing undervalued
 to cato's daughter brutus portia
 nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
 for the four winds blow in from every coast
 renowned suitors and her sunny locks
 hang on her temples like a golden fleece
 which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand
 and many jasons come in quest of her
 o my antonio had i but the means
 to hold a rival place with one of them
 i have a mind presages me such thrift
 that i should questionless be fortunate
antonio thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea
 neither have i money nor commodity

act i
scene ii belmont a room in portia's house
 enter portia and nerissa
portia by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of
 this great world
nerissa you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in
 the same abundance as your good fortunes are and
 yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit
 with too much as they that starve with nothing it
 is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the
 mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but
 competency lives longer
portia good sentences and well pronounced
nerissa they would be better if well followed
portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to
 do chapels had been churches and poor men's
 cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that
 follows his own instructions i can easier teach
 twenty what were good to be done than be one of the
 twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may
 devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
 o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the
 youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
 cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to
 choose me a husband o me the word choose i may
 neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i
 dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed
 by the will of a dead father is it not hard
 nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none
nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their
 death have good inspirations therefore the lottery
 that he hath devised in these three chests of gold
 silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
 chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any
 rightly but one who shall rightly love but what
 warmth is there in your affection towards any of
 these princely suitors that are already come
portia i pray thee overname them and as thou namest
 them i will describe them and according to my
 description level at my affection
nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince
portia ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but
 talk of his horse and he makes it a great
 appropriation to his own good parts that he can
 shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his
 mother played false with a smith
nerissa then there is the county palatine
portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you
 will not have me choose he hears merry tales and
 smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping
 philosopher when he grows old being so full of
 unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be
 married to a death'shead with a bone in his mouth
 than to either of these god defend me from these
 two
nerissa how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon
portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man
 in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but
 he why he hath a horse better than the
 neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than
 the count palatine he is every man in no man if a
 throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will
 fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i
 should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me
 i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i
 shall never requite him
nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron
 of england
portia you know i say nothing to him for he understands
 not me nor i him he hath neither latin french
 nor italian and you will come into the court and
 swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english
 he is a proper man's picture but alas who can
 converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited
 i think he bought his doublet in italy his round
 hose in france his bonnet in germany and his
 behavior every where
nerissa what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour
portia that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he
 borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and
 swore he would pay him again when he was able i
 think the frenchman became his surety and sealed
 under for another
nerissa how like you the young german the duke of saxony's nephew
portia very vilely in the morning when he is sober and
 most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when
 he is best he is a little worse than a man and
 when he is worst he is little better than a beast
 and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall
 make shift to go without him
nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right
 casket you should refuse to perform your father's
 will if you should refuse to accept him
portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a
 deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket
 for if the devil be within and that temptation
 without i know he will choose it i will do any
 thing nerissa ere i'll be married to a sponge
nerissa you need not fear lady the having any of these
 lords they have acquainted me with their
 determinations which is indeed to return to their
 home and to trouble you with no more suit unless
 you may be won by some other sort than your father's
 imposition depending on the caskets
portia if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as
 chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner
 of my father's will i am glad this parcel of wooers
 are so reasonable for there is not one among them
 but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant
 them a fair departure
nerissa do you not remember lady in your father's time a
 venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither
 in company of the marquis of montferrat
portia yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called
nerissa true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish
 eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
portia i remember him well and i remember him worthy of
 thy praise
 enter a servingman
 how now what news
servant the four strangers seek for you madam to take
 their leave and there is a forerunner come from a
 fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the
 prince his master will be here tonight
portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
 heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should
 be glad of his approach if he have the condition
 of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had
 rather he should shrive me than wive me come
 nerissa sirrah go before
 whiles we shut the gates
 upon one wooer another knocks at the door

 enter bassanio and shylock
shylock three thousand ducats well
bassanio ay sir for three months
shylock for three months well
bassanio for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound
shylock antonio shall become bound well
bassanio may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i
 know your answer
shylock three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound
bassanio your answer to that
shylock antonio is a good man
bassanio have you heard any imputation to the contrary
shylock oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a
 good man is to have you understand me that he is
 sufficient yet his means are in supposition he
 hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the
 indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he
 hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and
 other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships
 are but boards sailors but men there be landrats
 and waterrats waterthieves and landthieves i
 mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters
 winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding
 sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may
 take his bond
bassanio be assured you may
shylock i will be assured i may and that i may be assured
 i will bethink me may i speak with antonio
bassanio if it please you to dine with us
shylock yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which
 your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i
 will buy with you sell with you talk with you
 walk with you and so following but i will not eat
 with you drink with you nor pray with you what
 news on the rialto who is he comes here
 enter antonio
bassanio this is signior antonio
shylock aside how like a fawning publican he looks
 i hate him for he is a christian
 but more for that in low simplicity
 he lends out money gratis and brings down
 the rate of usance here with us in venice
 if i can catch him once upon the hip
 i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him
 he hates our sacred nation and he rails
 even there where merchants most do congregate
 on me my bargains and my wellwon thrift
 which he calls interest cursed be my tribe
 if i forgive him
bassanio shylock do you hear
shylock i am debating of my present store
 and by the near guess of my memory
 i cannot instantly raise up the gross
 of full three thousand ducats what of that
 tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe
 will furnish me but soft how many months
 do you desire
 to antonio
 rest you fair good signior
 your worship was the last man in our mouths
antonio shylock although i neither lend nor borrow
 by taking nor by giving of excess
 yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
 i'll break a custom is he yet possess'd
 how much ye would
shylock ay ay three thousand ducats
antonio and for three months
shylock i had forgot three months you told me so
 well then your bond and let me see but hear you
 methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
 upon advantage
antonio i do never use it
shylock when jacob grazed his uncle laban's sheep
 this jacob from our holy abram was
 as his wise mother wrought in his behalf
 the third possessor ay he was the third
antonio and what of him did he take interest
shylock no not take interest not as you would say
 directly interest mark what jacob did
 when laban and himself were compromised
 that all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
 should fall as jacob's hire the ewes being rank
 in the end of autumn turned to the rams
 and when the work of generation was
 between these woolly breeders in the act
 the skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands
 and in the doing of the deed of kind
 he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
 who then conceiving did in eaning time
 fall particolour'd lambs and those were jacob's
 this was a way to thrive and he was blest
 and thrift is blessing if men steal it not
antonio this was a venture sir that jacob served for
 a thing not in his power to bring to pass
 but sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven
 was this inserted to make interest good
 or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
shylock i cannot tell i make it breed as fast
 but note me signior
antonio mark you this bassanio
 the devil can cite scripture for his purpose
 an evil soul producing holy witness
 is like a villain with a smiling cheek
 a goodly apple rotten at the heart
 o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
shylock three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
 three months from twelve then let me see the rate
antonio well shylock shall we be beholding to you
shylock signior antonio many a time and oft
 in the rialto you have rated me
 about my moneys and my usances
 still have i borne it with a patient shrug
 for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe
 you call me misbeliever cutthroat dog
 and spit upon my jewish gaberdine
 and all for use of that which is mine own
 well then it now appears you need my help
 go to then you come to me and you say
 shylock we would have moneys you say so
 you that did void your rheum upon my beard
 and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
 over your threshold moneys is your suit
 what should i say to you should i not say
 hath a dog money is it possible
 a cur can lend three thousand ducats or
 shall i bend low and in a bondman's key
 with bated breath and whispering humbleness say this
 fair sir you spit on me on wednesday last
 you spurn'd me such a day another time
 you call'd me dog and for these courtesies
 i'll lend you thus much moneys'
antonio i am as like to call thee so again
 to spit on thee again to spurn thee too
 if thou wilt lend this money lend it not
 as to thy friends for when did friendship take
 a breed for barren metal of his friend
 but lend it rather to thine enemy
 who if he break thou mayst with better face
 exact the penalty
shylock why look you how you storm
 i would be friends with you and have your love
 forget the shames that you have stain'd me with
 supply your present wants and take no doit
 of usance for my moneys and you'll not hear me
 this is kind i offer
bassanio this were kindness
shylock this kindness will i show
 go with me to a notary seal me there
 your single bond and in a merry sport
 if you repay me not on such a day
 in such a place such sum or sums as are
 express'd in the condition let the forfeit
 be nominated for an equal pound
 of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
 in what part of your body pleaseth me
antonio content i faith i'll seal to such a bond
 and say there is much kindness in the jew
bassanio you shall not seal to such a bond for me
 i'll rather dwell in my necessity
antonio why fear not man i will not forfeit it
 within these two months that's a month before
 this bond expires i do expect return
 of thrice three times the value of this bond
shylock o father abram what these christians are
 whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
 the thoughts of others pray you tell me this
 if he should break his day what should i gain
 by the exaction of the forfeiture
 a pound of man's flesh taken from a man
 is not so estimable profitable neither
 as flesh of muttons beefs or goats i say
 to buy his favour i extend this friendship
 if he will take it so if not adieu
 and for my love i pray you wrong me not
antonio yes shylock i will seal unto this bond
shylock then meet me forthwith at the notary's
 give him direction for this merry bond
 and i will go and purse the ducats straight
 see to my house left in the fearful guard
 of an unthrifty knave and presently
 i will be with you
antonio hie thee gentle jew
 exit shylock
 the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind
bassanio i like not fair terms and a villain's mind
antonio come on in this there can be no dismay

 bars me the right of voluntary choosing

 and hedged me by his wit to yield myself
 his wife who wins me by that means i told you
 yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
 as any comer i have look'd on yet
 for my affection
morocco even for that i thank you
 therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets
 to try my fortune by this scimitar
 that slew the sophy and a persian prince
 that won three fields of sultan solyman
 i would outstare the sternest eyes that look
 outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
 pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear
 yea mock the lion when he roars for prey
 to win thee lady but alas the while
 if hercules and lichas play at dice
 which is the better man the greater throw
 may turn by fortune from the weaker hand
 so is alcides beaten by his page
 and so may i blind fortune leading me
 miss that which one unworthier may attain
 and die with grieving
portia you must take your chance
 and either not attempt to choose at all
 or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
 never to speak to lady afterward
 in way of marriage therefore be advised
morocco nor will not come bring me unto my chance

 with that keen appetite that he sits down
 where is the horse that doth untread again
 his tedious measures with the unbated fire
 that he did pace them first all things that are
 are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd
 how like a younker or a prodigal
 the scarfed bark puts from her native bay
 hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind
 how like the prodigal doth she return
 with overweather'd ribs and ragged sails
 lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind
salarino here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter

 the pretty follies that themselves commit
 for if they could cupid himself would blush
 to see me thus transformed to a boy
lorenzo descend for you must be my torchbearer
jessica what must i hold a candle to my shames

scene vii belmont a room in portia's house
 flourish of cornets enter portia with the
 prince of morocco and their trains
portia go draw aside the curtains and discover
 the several caskets to this noble prince
 now make your choice
morocco the first of gold who this inscription bears
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 the second silver which this promise carries
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 this third dull lead with warning all as blunt
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 how shall i know if i do choose the right
portia the one of them contains my picture prince
 if you choose that then i am yours withal
morocco some god direct my judgment let me see
 i will survey the inscriptions back again
 what says this leaden casket
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 must give for what for lead hazard for lead
 this casket threatens men that hazard all
 do it in hope of fair advantages
 a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
 i'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
 what says the silver with her virgin hue
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 as much as he deserves pause there morocco
 and weigh thy value with an even hand
 if thou be'st rated by thy estimation
 thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
 may not extend so far as to the lady
 and yet to be afeard of my deserving
 were but a weak disabling of myself
 as much as i deserve why that's the lady
 i do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
 in graces and in qualities of breeding
 but more than these in love i do deserve
 what if i stray'd no further but chose here
 let's see once more this saying graved in gold
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 why that's the lady all the world desires her
 from the four corners of the earth they come
 to kiss this shrine this mortalbreathing saint
 the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
 of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now
 for princes to come view fair portia
 the watery kingdom whose ambitious head
 spits in the face of heaven is no bar
 to stop the foreign spirits but they come
 as o'er a brook to see fair portia
 one of these three contains her heavenly picture
 is't like that lead contains her twere damnation
 to think so base a thought it were too gross
 to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
 or shall i think in silver she's immured
 being ten times undervalued to tried gold
 o sinful thought never so rich a gem
 was set in worse than gold they have in england
 a coin that bears the figure of an angel
 stamped in gold but that's insculp'd upon
 but here an angel in a golden bed
 lies all within deliver me the key
 here do i choose and thrive i as i may
portia there take it prince and if my form lie there
 then i am yours
 he unlocks the golden casket
morocco o hell what have we here
 a carrion death within whose empty eye
 there is a written scroll i'll read the writing
 reads
 all that glitters is not gold
 often have you heard that told
 many a man his life hath sold
 but my outside to behold
 gilded tombs do worms enfold
 had you been as wise as bold
 young in limbs in judgment old
 your answer had not been inscroll'd
 fare you well your suit is cold
 cold indeed and labour lost
 then farewell heat and welcome frost
 portia adieu i have too grieved a heart
 to take a tedious leave thus losers part
 exit with his train flourish of cornets
portia a gentle riddance draw the curtains go
 let all of his complexion choose me so

scene viii venice a street
 enter salarino and salanio
salarino why man i saw bassanio under sail
 with him is gratiano gone along
 and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not
salanio the villain jew with outcries raised the duke
 who went with him to search bassanio's ship
salarino he came too late the ship was under sail
 but there the duke was given to understand
 that in a gondola were seen together
 lorenzo and his amorous jessica
 besides antonio certified the duke
 they were not with bassanio in his ship
salanio i never heard a passion so confused
 so strange outrageous and so variable
 as the dog jew did utter in the streets
 my daughter o my ducats o my daughter
 fled with a christian o my christian ducats
 justice the law my ducats and my daughter
 a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
 of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter
 and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones
 stolen by my daughter justice find the girl
 she hath the stones upon her and the ducats'
salarino why all the boys in venice follow him
 crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
salanio let good antonio look he keep his day
 or he shall pay for this
salarino marry well remember'd
 i reason'd with a frenchman yesterday
 who told me in the narrow seas that part
 the french and english there miscarried
 a vessel of our country richly fraught
 i thought upon antonio when he told me
 and wish'd in silence that it were not his
salanio you were best to tell antonio what you hear
 yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
salarino a kinder gentleman treads not the earth
 i saw bassanio and antonio part
 bassanio told him he would make some speed
 of his return he answer'd do not so
 slubber not business for my sake bassanio
 but stay the very riping of the time
 and for the jew's bond which he hath of me
 let it not enter in your mind of love
 be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
 to courtship and such fair ostents of love
 as shall conveniently become you there'
 and even there his eye being big with tears
 turning his face he put his hand behind him
 and with affection wondrous sensible
 he wrung bassanio's hand and so they parted
salanio i think he only loves the world for him
 i pray thee let us go and find him out
 and quicken his embraced heaviness
 with some delight or other
salarino do we so

nerissa quick quick i pray thee draw the curtain straight
 the prince of arragon hath ta'en his oath
 and comes to his election presently
 flourish of cornets enter the prince of arragon
 portia and their trains
portia behold there stand the caskets noble prince
 if you choose that wherein i am contain'd
 straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized
 but if you fail without more speech my lord
 you must be gone from hence immediately
arragon i am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things
 first never to unfold to any one
 which casket twas i chose next if i fail
 of the right casket never in my life
 to woo a maid in way of marriage lastly
 if i do fail in fortune of my choice
 immediately to leave you and be gone
portia to these injunctions every one doth swear
 that comes to hazard for my worthless self
arragon and so have i address'd me fortune now
 to my heart's hope gold silver and base lead
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard
 what says the golden chest ha let me see
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 what many men desire that many may be meant
 by the fool multitude that choose by show
 not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
 which pries not to the interior but like the martlet
 builds in the weather on the outward wall
 even in the force and road of casualty
 i will not choose what many men desire
 because i will not jump with common spirits
 and rank me with the barbarous multitudes
 why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse
 tell me once more what title thou dost bear
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 and well said too for who shall go about
 to cozen fortune and be honourable
 without the stamp of merit let none presume
 to wear an undeserved dignity
 o that estates degrees and offices
 were not derived corruptly and that clear honour
 were purchased by the merit of the wearer
 how many then should cover that stand bare
 how many be commanded that command
 how much low peasantry would then be glean'd
 from the true seed of honour and how much honour
 pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
 to be newvarnish'd well but to my choice
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 i will assume desert give me a key for this
 and instantly unlock my fortunes here
 he opens the silver casket
portia too long a pause for that which you find there
arragon what's here the portrait of a blinking idiot
 presenting me a schedule i will read it
 how much unlike art thou to portia
 how much unlike my hopes and my deservings
 who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves'
 did i deserve no more than a fool's head
 is that my prize are my deserts no better
portia to offend and judge are distinct offices
 and of opposed natures
arragon what is here
 reads
 the fire seven times tried this
 seven times tried that judgment is
 that did never choose amiss
 some there be that shadows kiss
 such have but a shadow's bliss
 there be fools alive i wis
 silver'd o'er and so was this
 take what wife you will to bed
 i will ever be your head
 so be gone you are sped
 still more fool i shall appear
 by the time i linger here
 with one fool's head i came to woo
 but i go away with two
 sweet adieu i'll keep my oath
 patiently to bear my wroth

salanio now what news on the rialto
salarino why yet it lives there uncheck'd that antonio hath
 a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas
 the goodwins i think they call the place a very
 dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many
 a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip
 report be an honest woman of her word
salanio i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
 knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
 wept for the death of a third husband but it is
 true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
 plain highway of talk that the good antonio the
 honest antonioo that i had a title good enough
 to keep his name company
salarino come the full stop
salanio ha what sayest thou why the end is he hath
 lost a ship
salarino i would it might prove the end of his losses
salanio let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my
 prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew
 enter shylock
 how now shylock what news among the merchants
shylock you know none so well none so well as you of my
 daughter's flight
salarino that's certain i for my part knew the tailor
 that made the wings she flew withal
salanio and shylock for his own part knew the bird was
 fledged and then it is the complexion of them all
 to leave the dam
shylock she is damned for it
salanio that's certain if the devil may be her judge
shylock my own flesh and blood to rebel
salanio out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years
shylock i say my daughter is my flesh and blood
salarino there is more difference between thy flesh and hers
 than between jet and ivory more between your bloods
 than there is between red wine and rhenish but
 tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any
 loss at sea or no
shylock there i have another bad match a bankrupt a
 prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the
 rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon
 the mart let him look to his bond he was wont to
 call me usurer let him look to his bond he was
 wont to lend money for a christian courtesy let him
 look to his bond
salarino why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take
 his flesh what's that good for
shylock to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else
 it will feed my revenge he hath disgraced me and
 hindered me half a million laughed at my losses
 mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my
 bargains cooled my friends heated mine
 enemies and what's his reason i am a jew hath
 not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs
 dimensions senses affections passions fed with
 the same food hurt with the same weapons subject
 to the same diseases healed by the same means
 warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as
 a christian is if you prick us do we not bleed
 if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison
 us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not
 revenge if we are like you in the rest we will
 resemble you in that if a jew wrong a christian
 what is his humility revenge if a christian
 wrong a jew what should his sufferance be by
 christian example why revenge the villany you
 teach me i will execute and it shall go hard but i
 will better the instruction

act iii
scene ii belmont a room in portia's house
 enter bassanio portia gratiano nerissa and
 attendants
portia i pray you tarry pause a day or two
 before you hazard for in choosing wrong
 i lose your company therefore forbear awhile
 there's something tells me but it is not love
 i would not lose you and you know yourself
 hate counsels not in such a quality
 but lest you should not understand me well
 and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
 i would detain you here some month or two
 before you venture for me i could teach you
 how to choose right but i am then forsworn
 so will i never be so may you miss me
 but if you do you'll make me wish a sin
 that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes
 they have o'erlook'd me and divided me
 one half of me is yours the other half yours
 mine own i would say but if mine then yours
 and so all yours o these naughty times
 put bars between the owners and their rights
 and so though yours not yours prove it so
 let fortune go to hell for it not i
 i speak too long but tis to peize the time
 to eke it and to draw it out in length
 to stay you from election
bassanio let me choose
 for as i am i live upon the rack
portia upon the rack bassanio then confess
 what treason there is mingled with your love
bassanio none but that ugly treason of mistrust
 which makes me fear the enjoying of my love
 there may as well be amity and life
 tween snow and fire as treason and my love
portia ay but i fear you speak upon the rack
 where men enforced do speak anything
bassanio promise me life and i'll confess the truth
portia well then confess and live
bassanio confess and love'
 had been the very sum of my confession
 o happy torment when my torturer
 doth teach me answers for deliverance
 but let me to my fortune and the caskets
portia away then i am lock'd in one of them
 if you do love me you will find me out
 nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
 let music sound while he doth make his choice
 then if he lose he makes a swanlike end
 fading in music that the comparison
 may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
 and watery deathbed for him he may win
 and what is music then then music is
 even as the flourish when true subjects bow
 to a newcrowned monarch such it is
 as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
 that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
 and summon him to marriage now he goes
 with no less presence but with much more love
 than young alcides when he did redeem
 the virgin tribute paid by howling troy
 to the seamonster i stand for sacrifice
 the rest aloof are the dardanian wives
 with bleared visages come forth to view
 the issue of the exploit go hercules
 live thou i live with much much more dismay
 i view the fight than thou that makest the fray
 music whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself
 
 song
 tell me where is fancy bred
 or in the heart or in the head
 how begot how nourished
 reply reply
 it is engender'd in the eyes
 with gazing fed and fancy dies
 in the cradle where it lies
 let us all ring fancy's knell
 i'll begin itding dong bell
all ding dong bell
bassanio so may the outward shows be least themselves
 the world is still deceived with ornament
 in law what plea so tainted and corrupt
 but being seasoned with a gracious voice
 obscures the show of evil in religion
 what damned error but some sober brow
 will bless it and approve it with a text
 hiding the grossness with fair ornament
 there is no vice so simple but assumes
 some mark of virtue on his outward parts
 how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
 as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
 the beards of hercules and frowning mars
 who inward search'd have livers white as milk
 and these assume but valour's excrement
 to render them redoubted look on beauty
 and you shall see tis purchased by the weight
 which therein works a miracle in nature
 making them lightest that wear most of it
 so are those crisped snaky golden locks
 which make such wanton gambols with the wind
 upon supposed fairness often known
 to be the dowry of a second head
 the skull that bred them in the sepulchre
 thus ornament is but the guiled shore
 to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
 veiling an indian beauty in a word
 the seeming truth which cunning times put on
 to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold
 hard food for midas i will none of thee
 nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
 tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
 which rather threatenest than dost promise aught
 thy paleness moves me more than eloquence
 and here choose i joy be the consequence
portia aside how all the other passions fleet to air
 as doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair
 and shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy o love
 be moderate allay thy ecstasy
 in measure rein thy joy scant this excess
 i feel too much thy blessing make it less
 for fear i surfeit
bassanio what find i here
 opening the leaden casket
 fair portia's counterfeit what demigod
 hath come so near creation move these eyes
 or whether riding on the balls of mine
 seem they in motion here are sever'd lips
 parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
 should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs
 the painter plays the spider and hath woven
 a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
 faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes
 how could he see to do them having made one
 methinks it should have power to steal both his
 and leave itself unfurnish'd yet look how far
 the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
 in underprizing it so far this shadow
 doth limp behind the substance here's the scroll
 the continent and summary of my fortune
 reads
 you that choose not by the view
 chance as fair and choose as true
 since this fortune falls to you
 be content and seek no new
 if you be well pleased with this
 and hold your fortune for your bliss
 turn you where your lady is
 and claim her with a loving kiss
 a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave
 i come by note to give and to receive
 like one of two contending in a prize
 that thinks he hath done well in people's eyes
 hearing applause and universal shout
 giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
 whether these pearls of praise be his or no
 so thrice fair lady stand i even so
 as doubtful whether what i see be true
 until confirm'd sign'd ratified by you
portia you see me lord bassanio where i stand
 such as i am though for myself alone
 i would not be ambitious in my wish
 to wish myself much better yet for you
 i would be trebled twenty times myself
 a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
 that only to stand high in your account
 i might in virtue beauties livings friends
 exceed account but the full sum of me
 is sum of something which to term in gross
 is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractised
 happy in this she is not yet so old
 but she may learn happier than this
 she is not bred so dull but she can learn
 happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
 commits itself to yours to be directed
 as from her lord her governor her king
 myself and what is mine to you and yours
 is now converted but now i was the lord
 of this fair mansion master of my servants
 queen o'er myself and even now but now
 this house these servants and this same myself
 are yours my lord i give them with this ring
 which when you part from lose or give away
 let it presage the ruin of your love
 and be my vantage to exclaim on you
bassanio madam you have bereft me of all words
 only my blood speaks to you in my veins
 and there is such confusion in my powers
 as after some oration fairly spoke
 by a beloved prince there doth appear
 among the buzzing pleased multitude
 where every something being blent together
 turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
 express'd and not express'd but when this ring
 parts from this finger then parts life from hence
 o then be bold to say bassanio's dead
nerissa my lord and lady it is now our time
 that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
 to cry good joy good joy my lord and lady
gratiano my lord bassanio and my gentle lady
 i wish you all the joy that you can wish
 for i am sure you can wish none from me
 and when your honours mean to solemnize
 the bargain of your faith i do beseech you
 even at that time i may be married too
bassanio with all my heart so thou canst get a wife
gratiano i thank your lordship you have got me one
 my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
 you saw the mistress i beheld the maid
 you loved i loved for intermission
 no more pertains to me my lord than you
 your fortune stood upon the casket there
 and so did mine too as the matter falls
 for wooing here until i sweat again
 and sweating until my very roof was dry
 with oaths of love at last if promise last
 i got a promise of this fair one here
 to have her love provided that your fortune
 achieved her mistress
portia is this true nerissa
nerissa madam it is so you stand pleased withal
bassanio and do you gratiano mean good faith
gratiano yes faith my lord
bassanio our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage
gratiano we'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
nerissa what and stake down
gratiano no we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down
 but who comes here lorenzo and his infidel what
 and my old venetian friend salerio
 enter lorenzo jessica and salerio a messenger
 from venice
bassanio lorenzo and salerio welcome hither
 if that the youth of my new interest here
 have power to bid you welcome by your leave
 i bid my very friends and countrymen
 sweet portia welcome
portia so do i my lord
 they are entirely welcome
lorenzo i thank your honour for my part my lord
 my purpose was not to have seen you here
 but meeting with salerio by the way
 he did entreat me past all saying nay
 to come with him along
salerio i did my lord
 and i have reason for it signior antonio
 commends him to you
 gives bassanio a letter
bassanio ere i ope his letter
 i pray you tell me how my good friend doth
salerio not sick my lord unless it be in mind
 nor well unless in mind his letter there
 will show you his estate
gratiano nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
 your hand salerio what's the news from venice
 how doth that royal merchant good antonio
 i know he will be glad of our success
 we are the jasons we have won the fleece
salerio i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
portia there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
 that steals the colour from bassanio's cheek
 some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
 could turn so much the constitution
 of any constant man what worse and worse
 with leave bassanio i am half yourself
 and i must freely have the half of anything
 that this same paper brings you
bassanio o sweet portia
 here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
 that ever blotted paper gentle lady
 when i did first impart my love to you
 i freely told you all the wealth i had
 ran in my veins i was a gentleman
 and then i told you true and yet dear lady
 rating myself at nothing you shall see
 how much i was a braggart when i told you
 my state was nothing i should then have told you
 that i was worse than nothing for indeed
 i have engaged myself to a dear friend
 engaged my friend to his mere enemy
 to feed my means here is a letter lady
 the paper as the body of my friend
 and every word in it a gaping wound
 issuing lifeblood but is it true salerio
 have all his ventures fail'd what not one hit
 from tripolis from mexico and england
 from lisbon barbary and india
 and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
 of merchantmarring rocks
salerio not one my lord
 besides it should appear that if he had
 the present money to discharge the jew
 he would not take it never did i know
 a creature that did bear the shape of man
 so keen and greedy to confound a man
 he plies the duke at morning and at night
 and doth impeach the freedom of the state
 if they deny him justice twenty merchants
 the duke himself and the magnificoes
 of greatest port have all persuaded with him
 but none can drive him from the envious plea
 of forfeiture of justice and his bond
jessica when i was with him i have heard him swear
 to tubal and to chus his countrymen
 that he would rather have antonio's flesh
 than twenty times the value of the sum
 that he did owe him and i know my lord
 if law authority and power deny not
 it will go hard with poor antonio
portia is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
bassanio the dearest friend to me the kindest man
 the bestcondition'd and unwearied spirit
 in doing courtesies and one in whom
 the ancient roman honour more appears
 than any that draws breath in italy
portia what sum owes he the jew
bassanio for me three thousand ducats

shylock gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy
 this is the fool that lent out money gratis
 gaoler look to him
antonio hear me yet good shylock
shylock i'll have my bond speak not against my bond
 i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond
 thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause
 but since i am a dog beware my fangs
 the duke shall grant me justice i do wonder
 thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
 to come abroad with him at his request
antonio i pray thee hear me speak
shylock i'll have my bond i will not hear thee speak
 i'll have my bond and therefore speak no more
 i'll not be made a soft and dulleyed fool
 to shake the head relent and sigh and yield
 to christian intercessors follow not
 i'll have no speaking i will have my bond
 exit
salarino it is the most impenetrable cur
 that ever kept with men
antonio let him alone
 i'll follow him no more with bootless prayers
 he seeks my life his reason well i know
 i oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
 many that have at times made moan to me
 therefore he hates me
salarino i am sure the duke
 will never grant this forfeiture to hold
antonio the duke cannot deny the course of law
 for the commodity that strangers have
 with us in venice if it be denied
 will much impeach the justice of his state
 since that the trade and profit of the city
 consisteth of all nations therefore go
 these griefs and losses have so bated me
 that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
 tomorrow to my bloody creditor
 well gaoler on pray god bassanio come
 to see me pay his debt and then i care not

scene iv belmont a room in portia's house
 enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and
 balthasar
lorenzo madam although i speak it in your presence
 you have a noble and a true conceit
 of godlike amity which appears most strongly
 in bearing thus the absence of your lord
 but if you knew to whom you show this honour
 how true a gentleman you send relief
 how dear a lover of my lord your husband
 i know you would be prouder of the work
 than customary bounty can enforce you
portia i never did repent for doing good
 nor shall not now for in companions
 that do converse and waste the time together
 whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
 there must be needs a like proportion
 of lineaments of manners and of spirit
 which makes me think that this antonio
 being the bosom lover of my lord
 must needs be like my lord if it be so
 how little is the cost i have bestow'd
 in purchasing the semblance of my soul
 from out the state of hellish misery
 this comes too near the praising of myself
 therefore no more of it hear other things
 lorenzo i commit into your hands
 the husbandry and manage of my house
 until my lord's return for mine own part
 i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
 to live in prayer and contemplation
 only attended by nerissa here
 until her husband and my lord's return
 there is a monastery two miles off
 and there will we abide i do desire you
 not to deny this imposition
 the which my love and some necessity
 now lays upon you
lorenzo madam with all my heart
 i shall obey you in all fair commands
portia my people do already know my mind
 and will acknowledge you and jessica
 in place of lord bassanio and myself
 and so farewell till we shall meet again
lorenzo fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
jessica i wish your ladyship all heart's content
portia i thank you for your wish and am well pleased
 to wish it back on you fare you well jessica
 exeunt jessica and lorenzo
 now balthasar
 as i have ever found thee honesttrue
 so let me find thee still take this same letter
 and use thou all the endeavour of a man
 in speed to padua see thou render this
 into my cousin's hand doctor bellario
 and look what notes and garments he doth give thee
 bring them i pray thee with imagined speed
 unto the tranect to the common ferry
 which trades to venice waste no time in words
 but get thee gone i shall be there before thee
balthasar madam i go with all convenient speed
 exit
portia come on nerissa i have work in hand
 that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands
 before they think of us
nerissa shall they see us
portia they shall nerissa but in such a habit
 that they shall think we are accomplished
 with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager
 when we are both accoutred like young men
 i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two
 and wear my dagger with the braver grace
 and speak between the change of man and boy
 with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
 into a manly stride and speak of frays
 like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
 how honourable ladies sought my love
 which i denying they fell sick and died
 i could not do withal then i'll repent
 and wish for all that that i had not killed them
 and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell
 that men shall swear i have discontinued school
 above a twelvemonth i have within my mind
 a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks
 which i will practise
nerissa why shall we turn to men
portia fie what a question's that
 if thou wert near a lewd interpreter
 but come i'll tell thee all my whole device
 when i am in my coach which stays for us
 at the park gate and therefore haste away
 for we must measure twenty miles today

 enter launcelot and jessica
launcelot yes truly for look you the sins of the father
 are to be laid upon the children therefore i
 promise ye i fear you i was always plain with
 you and so now i speak my agitation of the matter
 therefore be of good cheer for truly i think you
 are damned there is but one hope in it that can do
 you any good and that is but a kind of bastard
 hope neither
jessica and what hope is that i pray thee
launcelot marry you may partly hope that your father got you
 not that you are not the jew's daughter
jessica that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the
 sins of my mother should be visited upon me
launcelot truly then i fear you are damned both by father and
 mother thus when i shun scylla your father i
 fall into charybdis your mother well you are
 gone both ways
jessica i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a
 christian
launcelot truly the more to blame he we were christians
 enow before e'en as many as could well live one by
 another this making christians will raise the
 price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we
 shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
 enter lorenzo
jessica i'll tell my husband launcelot what you say here he comes
lorenzo i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if
 you thus get my wife into corners
jessica nay you need not fear us lorenzo launcelot and i
 are out he tells me flatly there is no mercy for
 me in heaven because i am a jew's daughter and he
 says you are no good member of the commonwealth
 for in converting jews to christians you raise the
 price of pork
lorenzo i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
 you can the getting up of the negro's belly the
 moor is with child by you launcelot
launcelot it is much that the moor should be more than reason
 but if she be less than an honest woman she is
 indeed more than i took her for
lorenzo how every fool can play upon the word i think the
 best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence
 and discourse grow commendable in none only but
 parrots go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner
launcelot that is done sir they have all stomachs
lorenzo goodly lord what a witsnapper are you then bid
 them prepare dinner
launcelot that is done too sir only cover is the word
lorenzo will you cover then sir
launcelot not so sir neither i know my duty
lorenzo yet more quarrelling with occasion wilt thou show
 the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant i pray
 tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning
 go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve
 in the meat and we will come in to dinner
launcelot for the table sir it shall be served in for the
 meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in
 to dinner sir why let it be as humours and
 conceits shall govern
 exit
lorenzo o dear discretion how his words are suited
 the fool hath planted in his memory
 an army of good words and i do know
 a many fools that stand in better place
 garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word
 defy the matter how cheerest thou jessica
 and now good sweet say thy opinion
 how dost thou like the lord bassanio's wife
jessica past all expressing it is very meet
 the lord bassanio live an upright life
 for having such a blessing in his lady
 he finds the joys of heaven here on earth
 and if on earth he do not mean it then
 in reason he should never come to heaven
 why if two gods should play some heavenly match
 and on the wager lay two earthly women
 and portia one there must be something else
 pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world
 hath not her fellow
lorenzo even such a husband
 hast thou of me as she is for a wife
jessica nay but ask my opinion too of that
lorenzo i will anon first let us go to dinner
jessica nay let me praise you while i have a stomach
lorenzo no pray thee let it serve for tabletalk
 then howso'er thou speak'st mong other things

act iv
scene i venice a court of justice
 enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio
 gratiano salerio and others
duke what is antonio here
antonio ready so please your grace
duke i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
 a stony adversary an inhuman wretch
 uncapable of pity void and empty
 from any dram of mercy
antonio i have heard
 your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
 his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
 and that no lawful means can carry me
 out of his envy's reach i do oppose
 my patience to his fury and am arm'd
 to suffer with a quietness of spirit
 the very tyranny and rage of his
duke go one and call the jew into the court
salerio he is ready at the door he comes my lord
 enter shylock
duke make room and let him stand before our face
 shylock the world thinks and i think so too
 that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
 to the last hour of act and then tis thought
 thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
 than is thy strange apparent cruelty
 and where thou now exact'st the penalty
 which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh
 thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
 but touch'd with human gentleness and love
 forgive a moiety of the principal
 glancing an eye of pity on his losses
 that have of late so huddled on his back
 enow to press a royal merchant down
 and pluck commiseration of his state
 from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
 from stubborn turks and tartars never train'd
 to offices of tender courtesy
 we all expect a gentle answer jew
shylock i have possess'd your grace of what i purpose
 and by our holy sabbath have i sworn
 to have the due and forfeit of my bond
 if you deny it let the danger light
 upon your charter and your city's freedom
 you'll ask me why i rather choose to have
 a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
 three thousand ducats i'll not answer that
 but say it is my humour is it answer'd
 what if my house be troubled with a rat
 and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
 to have it baned what are you answer'd yet
 some men there are love not a gaping pig
 some that are mad if they behold a cat
 and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose
 cannot contain their urine for affection
 mistress of passion sways it to the mood
 of what it likes or loathes now for your answer
 as there is no firm reason to be render'd
 why he cannot abide a gaping pig
 why he a harmless necessary cat
 why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
 must yield to such inevitable shame
 as to offend himself being offended
 so can i give no reason nor i will not
 more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
 i bear antonio that i follow thus
 a losing suit against him are you answer'd
bassanio this is no answer thou unfeeling man
 to excuse the current of thy cruelty
shylock i am not bound to please thee with my answers
bassanio do all men kill the things they do not love
shylock hates any man the thing he would not kill
bassanio every offence is not a hate at first
shylock what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
antonio i pray you think you question with the jew
 you may as well go stand upon the beach
 and bid the main flood bate his usual height
 you may as well use question with the wolf
 why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
 you may as well forbid the mountain pines
 to wag their high tops and to make no noise
 when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
 you may as well do anything most hard
 as seek to soften thatthan which what's harder
 his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you
 make no more offers use no farther means
 but with all brief and plain conveniency
 let me have judgment and the jew his will
bassanio for thy three thousand ducats here is six
shylock what judgment shall i dread doing
 were in six parts and every part a ducat
 i would not draw them i would have my bond
duke how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
shylock what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong
 you have among you many a purchased slave
 which like your asses and your dogs and mules
 you use in abject and in slavish parts
 because you bought them shall i say to you
 let them be free marry them to your heirs
 why sweat they under burthens let their beds
 be made as soft as yours and let their palates
 be season'd with such viands you will answer
 the slaves are ours so do i answer you
 the pound of flesh which i demand of him
 is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it
 if you deny me fie upon your law
 there is no force in the decrees of venice
 i stand for judgment answer shall i have it
duke upon my power i may dismiss this court
 unless bellario a learned doctor
 whom i have sent for to determine this
 come here today
salerio my lord here stays without
 a messenger with letters from the doctor
 new come from padua
duke bring us the letter call the messenger
bassanio good cheer antonio what man courage yet
 the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
 ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
antonio i am a tainted wether of the flock
 meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
 drops earliest to the ground and so let me
 you cannot better be employ'd bassanio
 than to live still and write mine epitaph
 enter nerissa dressed like a lawyer's clerk
duke came you from padua from bellario
nerissa from both my lord bellario greets your grace
 presenting a letter
bassanio why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
shylock to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
gratiano not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew
 thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can
 no not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness
 of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee
shylock no none that thou hast wit enough to make
gratiano o be thou damn'd inexecrable dog
 and for thy life let justice be accused
 thou almost makest me waver in my faith
 to hold opinion with pythagoras
 that souls of animals infuse themselves
 into the trunks of men thy currish spirit
 govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter
 even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
 and whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam
 infused itself in thee for thy desires
 are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous
shylock till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
 thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
 repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
 to cureless ruin i stand here for law
duke this letter from bellario doth commend
 a young and learned doctor to our court
 where is he
nerissa he attendeth here hard by
 to know your answer whether you'll admit him
duke with all my heart some three or four of you
 go give him courteous conduct to this place
 meantime the court shall hear bellario's letter
clerk reads
 your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
 your letter i am very sick but in the instant that
 your messenger came in loving visitation was with
 me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar i
 acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
 the jew and antonio the merchant we turned o'er
 many books together he is furnished with my
 opinion which bettered with his own learning the
 greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes
 with him at my importunity to fill up your grace's
 request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of
 years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
 estimation for i never knew so young a body with so
 old a head i leave him to your gracious
 acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
 commendation
duke you hear the learn'd bellario what he writes
 and here i take it is the doctor come
 enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws
 give me your hand come you from old bellario
portia i did my lord
duke you are welcome take your place
 are you acquainted with the difference
 that holds this present question in the court
portia i am informed thoroughly of the cause
 which is the merchant here and which the jew
duke antonio and old shylock both stand forth
portia is your name shylock
shylock shylock is my name
portia of a strange nature is the suit you follow
 yet in such rule that the venetian law
 cannot impugn you as you do proceed
 you stand within his danger do you not
antonio ay so he says
portia do you confess the bond
antonio i do
portia then must the jew be merciful
shylock on what compulsion must i tell me that
portia the quality of mercy is not strain'd
 it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 upon the place beneath it is twice blest
 it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
 tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
 the throned monarch better than his crown
 his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
 the attribute to awe and majesty
 wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
 but mercy is above this sceptred sway
 it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
 it is an attribute to god himself
 and earthly power doth then show likest god's
 when mercy seasons justice therefore jew
 though justice be thy plea consider this
 that in the course of justice none of us
 should see salvation we do pray for mercy
 and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
 the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much
 to mitigate the justice of thy plea
 which if thou follow this strict court of venice
 must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there
shylock my deeds upon my head i crave the law
 the penalty and forfeit of my bond
portia is he not able to discharge the money
bassanio yes here i tender it for him in the court
 yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
 i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er
 on forfeit of my hands my head my heart
 if this will not suffice it must appear
 that malice bears down truth and i beseech you
 wrest once the law to your authority
 to do a great right do a little wrong
 and curb this cruel devil of his will
portia it must not be there is no power in venice
 can alter a decree established
 twill be recorded for a precedent
 and many an error by the same example
 will rush into the state it cannot be
shylock a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel
 o wise young judge how i do honour thee
portia i pray you let me look upon the bond
shylock here tis most reverend doctor here it is
portia shylock there's thrice thy money offer'd thee
shylock an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven
 shall i lay perjury upon my soul
 no not for venice
portia why this bond is forfeit
 and lawfully by this the jew may claim
 a pound of flesh to be by him cut off
 nearest the merchant's heart be merciful
 take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
shylock when it is paid according to the tenor
 it doth appear you are a worthy judge
 you know the law your exposition
 hath been most sound i charge you by the law
 whereof you are a welldeserving pillar
 proceed to judgment by my soul i swear
 there is no power in the tongue of man
 to alter me i stay here on my bond
antonio most heartily i do beseech the court
 to give the judgment
portia why then thus it is
 you must prepare your bosom for his knife
shylock o noble judge o excellent young man
portia for the intent and purpose of the law
 hath full relation to the penalty
 which here appeareth due upon the bond
shylock tis very true o wise and upright judge
 how much more elder art thou than thy looks
portia therefore lay bare your bosom
shylock ay his breast
 so says the bond doth it not noble judge
 nearest his heart those are the very words
portia it is so are there balance here to weigh
 the flesh
shylock i have them ready
portia have by some surgeon shylock on your charge
 to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
shylock is it so nominated in the bond
portia it is not so express'd but what of that
 twere good you do so much for charity
shylock i cannot find it tis not in the bond
portia you merchant have you any thing to say
antonio but little i am arm'd and well prepared
 give me your hand bassanio fare you well
 grieve not that i am fallen to this for you
 for herein fortune shows herself more kind
 than is her custom it is still her use
 to let the wretched man outlive his wealth
 to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
 an age of poverty from which lingering penance
 of such misery doth she cut me off
 commend me to your honourable wife
 tell her the process of antonio's end
 say how i loved you speak me fair in death
 and when the tale is told bid her be judge
 whether bassanio had not once a love
 repent but you that you shall lose your friend
 and he repents not that he pays your debt
 for if the jew do cut but deep enough
 i'll pay it presently with all my heart
bassanio antonio i am married to a wife
 which is as dear to me as life itself
 but life itself my wife and all the world
 are not with me esteem'd above thy life
 i would lose all ay sacrifice them all
 here to this devil to deliver you
portia your wife would give you little thanks for that
 if she were by to hear you make the offer
gratiano i have a wife whom i protest i love
 i would she were in heaven so she could
 entreat some power to change this currish jew
nerissa tis well you offer it behind her back
 the wish would make else an unquiet house
shylock these be the christian husbands i have a daughter
 would any of the stock of barrabas
 had been her husband rather than a christian
 aside
 we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence
portia a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine
 the court awards it and the law doth give it
shylock most rightful judge
portia and you must cut this flesh from off his breast
 the law allows it and the court awards it
shylock most learned judge a sentence come prepare
portia tarry a little there is something else
 this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
 the words expressly are a pound of flesh'
 take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
 but in the cutting it if thou dost shed
 one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods
 are by the laws of venice confiscate
 unto the state of venice
gratiano o upright judge mark jew o learned judge
shylock is that the law
portia thyself shalt see the act
 for as thou urgest justice be assured
 thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
gratiano o learned judge mark jew a learned judge
shylock i take this offer then pay the bond thrice
 and let the christian go
bassanio here is the money
portia soft
 the jew shall have all justice soft no haste
 he shall have nothing but the penalty
gratiano o jew an upright judge a learned judge
portia therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
 shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
 but just a pound of flesh if thou cut'st more
 or less than a just pound be it but so much
 as makes it light or heavy in the substance
 or the division of the twentieth part
 of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
 but in the estimation of a hair
 thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
gratiano a second daniel a daniel jew
 now infidel i have you on the hip
portia why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture
shylock give me my principal and let me go
bassanio i have it ready for thee here it is
portia he hath refused it in the open court
 he shall have merely justice and his bond
gratiano a daniel still say i a second daniel
 i thank thee jew for teaching me that word
shylock shall i not have barely my principal
portia thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
 to be so taken at thy peril jew
shylock why then the devil give him good of it
 i'll stay no longer question
portia tarry jew
 the law hath yet another hold on you
 it is enacted in the laws of venice
 if it be proved against an alien
 that by direct or indirect attempts
 he seek the life of any citizen
 the party gainst the which he doth contrive
 shall seize one half his goods the other half
 comes to the privy coffer of the state
 and the offender's life lies in the mercy
 of the duke only gainst all other voice
 in which predicament i say thou stand'st
 for it appears by manifest proceeding
 that indirectly and directly too
 thou hast contrived against the very life
 of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd
 the danger formerly by me rehearsed
 down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
gratiano beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
 and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
 thou hast not left the value of a cord
 therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge
duke that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits
 i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
 for half thy wealth it is antonio's
 the other half comes to the general state
 which humbleness may drive unto a fine
portia ay for the state not for antonio
shylock nay take my life and all pardon not that
 you take my house when you do take the prop
 that doth sustain my house you take my life
 when you do take the means whereby i live
portia what mercy can you render him antonio
gratiano a halter gratis nothing else for god's sake
antonio so please my lord the duke and all the court
 to quit the fine for one half of his goods
 i am content so he will let me have
 the other half in use to render it
 upon his death unto the gentleman
 that lately stole his daughter
 two things provided more that for this favour
 he presently become a christian
 the other that he do record a gift
 here in the court of all he dies possess'd
 unto his son lorenzo and his daughter
duke he shall do this or else i do recant
 the pardon that i late pronounced here
portia art thou contented jew what dost thou say
shylock i am content
portia clerk draw a deed of gift
shylock i pray you give me leave to go from hence
 i am not well send the deed after me
 and i will sign it
duke get thee gone but do it
gratiano in christening shalt thou have two godfathers
 had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
 to bring thee to the gallows not the font
 exit shylock
duke sir i entreat you home with me to dinner
portia i humbly do desire your grace of pardon
 i must away this night toward padua

 have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
 of grievous penalties in lieu whereof
 three thousand ducats due unto the jew
 we freely cope your courteous pains withal

portia he is well paid that is well satisfied
 and i delivering you am satisfied

 and you in love shall not deny me this
bassanio this ring good sir alas it is a trifle

 the dearest ring in venice will i give you
 and find it out by proclamation
 only for this i pray you pardon me

 the merchant of venice
act v
scene i belmont avenue to portia's house
 enter lorenzo and jessica
lorenzo the moon shines bright in such a night as this
 when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
 and they did make no noise in such a night
 troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls
 and sigh'd his soul toward the grecian tents
 where cressid lay that night
jessica in such a night
 did thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
 and saw the lion's shadow ere himself
 and ran dismay'd away
lorenzo in such a night
 stood dido with a willow in her hand
 upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
 to come again to carthage
jessica in such a night
 medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
 that did renew old aeson
lorenzo in such a night
 did jessica steal from the wealthy jew
 and with an unthrift love did run from venice
 as far as belmont
jessica in such a night
 did young lorenzo swear he loved her well
 stealing her soul with many vows of faith
 and ne'er a true one
lorenzo in such a night
 did pretty jessica like a little shrew
 slander her love and he forgave it her
jessica i would outnight you did no body come
 but hark i hear the footing of a man
 enter stephano
lorenzo who comes so fast in silence of the night
stephano a friend
lorenzo a friend what friend your name i pray you friend
stephano stephano is my name and i bring word
 my mistress will before the break of day
 be here at belmont she doth stray about
 by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
 for happy wedlock hours
lorenzo who comes with her
stephano none but a holy hermit and her maid
 i pray you is my master yet return'd
lorenzo he is not nor we have not heard from him
 but go we in i pray thee jessica
 and ceremoniously let us prepare
 some welcome for the mistress of the house
 enter launcelot
launcelot sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
lorenzo who calls
launcelot sola did you see master lorenzo
 master lorenzo sola sola
lorenzo leave hollaing man here
launcelot sola where where
lorenzo here
launcelot tell him there's a post come from my master with
 his horn full of good news my master will be here
 ere morning
 exit
lorenzo sweet soul let's in and there expect their coming
 and yet no matter why should we go in
 my friend stephano signify i pray you
 within the house your mistress is at hand
 and bring your music forth into the air
 exit stephano
 how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
 here will we sit and let the sounds of music
 creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
 become the touches of sweet harmony
 sit jessica look how the floor of heaven
 is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
 there's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
 but in his motion like an angel sings
 still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins
 such harmony is in immortal souls
 but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
 doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
 enter musicians
 come ho and wake diana with a hymn
 with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear
 and draw her home with music
 music
jessica i am never merry when i hear sweet music
lorenzo the reason is your spirits are attentive
 for do but note a wild and wanton herd
 or race of youthful and unhandled colts
 fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
 which is the hot condition of their blood
 if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
 or any air of music touch their ears
 you shall perceive them make a mutual stand
 their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
 by the sweet power of music therefore the poet
 did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods
 since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
 but music for the time doth change his nature
 the man that hath no music in himself
 nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds
 is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
 the motions of his spirit are dull as night
 and his affections dark as erebus
 let no such man be trusted mark the music
 enter portia and nerissa
portia that light we see is burning in my hall
 how far that little candle throws his beams
 so shines a good deed in a naughty world
nerissa when the moon shone we did not see the candle
portia so doth the greater glory dim the less
 a substitute shines brightly as a king
 unto the king be by and then his state
 empties itself as doth an inland brook
 into the main of waters music hark
nerissa it is your music madam of the house
portia nothing is good i see without respect
 methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
nerissa silence bestows that virtue on it madam
portia the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
 when neither is attended and i think
 the nightingale if she should sing by day
 when every goose is cackling would be thought
 no better a musician than the wren
 how many things by season season'd are
 to their right praise and true perfection
 peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion
 and would not be awaked
 music ceases
lorenzo that is the voice
 or i am much deceived of portia
portia he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
 by the bad voice
lorenzo dear lady welcome home
portia we have been praying for our husbands healths
 which speed we hope the better for our words
 are they return'd
lorenzo madam they are not yet
 but there is come a messenger before
 to signify their coming
portia go in nerissa
 give order to my servants that they take
 no note at all of our being absent hence
 nor you lorenzo jessica nor you
 a tucket sounds
lorenzo your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet
 we are no telltales madam fear you not
portia this night methinks is but the daylight sick
 it looks a little paler tis a day
 such as the day is when the sun is hid
 enter bassanio antonio gratiano and
 their followers
bassanio we should hold day with the antipodes
 if you would walk in absence of the sun
portia let me give light but let me not be light
 for a light wife doth make a heavy husband
 and never be bassanio so for me
 but god sort all you are welcome home my lord
bassanio i thank you madam give welcome to my friend
 this is the man this is antonio
 to whom i am so infinitely bound
portia you should in all sense be much bound to him
 for as i hear he was much bound for you
antonio no more than i am well acquitted of
portia sir you are very welcome to our house
 it must appear in other ways than words
 therefore i scant this breathing courtesy
gratiano to nerissa by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong
 in faith i gave it to the judge's clerk
 would he were gelt that had it for my part
 since you do take it love so much at heart
portia a quarrel ho already what's the matter
gratiano about a hoop of gold a paltry ring
 that she did give me whose posy was
 for all the world like cutler's poetry
 upon a knife love me and leave me not'
nerissa what talk you of the posy or the value
 you swore to me when i did give it you
 that you would wear it till your hour of death
 and that it should lie with you in your grave
 though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
 you should have been respective and have kept it
 gave it a judge's clerk no god's my judge
 the clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it
gratiano he will an if he live to be a man
nerissa ay if a woman live to be a man
gratiano now by this hand i gave it to a youth
 a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
 no higher than thyself the judge's clerk
 a prating boy that begg'd it as a fee
 i could not for my heart deny it him
portia you were to blame i must be plain with you
 to part so slightly with your wife's first gift
 a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
 and so riveted with faith unto your flesh
 i gave my love a ring and made him swear
 never to part with it and here he stands
 i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
 nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
 that the world masters now in faith gratiano
 you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
 an twere to me i should be mad at it
bassanio aside why i were best to cut my left hand off
 and swear i lost the ring defending it
gratiano my lord bassanio gave his ring away
 unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
 deserved it too and then the boy his clerk
 that took some pains in writing he begg'd mine
 and neither man nor master would take aught
 but the two rings
portia what ring gave you my lord
 not that i hope which you received of me
bassanio if i could add a lie unto a fault
 i would deny it but you see my finger
 hath not the ring upon it it is gone
portia even so void is your false heart of truth
 by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed
 until i see the ring
nerissa nor i in yours
 till i again see mine
bassanio sweet portia
 if you did know to whom i gave the ring
 if you did know for whom i gave the ring
 and would conceive for what i gave the ring
 and how unwillingly i left the ring
 when nought would be accepted but the ring
 you would abate the strength of your displeasure
portia if you had known the virtue of the ring
 or half her worthiness that gave the ring
 or your own honour to contain the ring
 you would not then have parted with the ring
 what man is there so much unreasonable
 if you had pleased to have defended it
 with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
 to urge the thing held as a ceremony
 nerissa teaches me what to believe
 i'll die for't but some woman had the ring
bassanio no by my honour madam by my soul
 no woman had it but a civil doctor
 which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
 and begg'd the ring the which i did deny him
 and suffer'd him to go displeased away
 even he that did uphold the very life
 of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady
 i was enforced to send it after him
 i was beset with shame and courtesy
 my honour would not let ingratitude
 so much besmear it pardon me good lady
 for by these blessed candles of the night
 had you been there i think you would have begg'd
 the ring of me to give the worthy doctor
portia let not that doctor e'er come near my house
 since he hath got the jewel that i loved
 and that which you did swear to keep for me
 i will become as liberal as you
 i'll not deny him any thing i have
 no not my body nor my husband's bed
 know him i shall i am well sure of it
 lie not a night from home watch me like argus
 if you do not if i be left alone
 now by mine honour which is yet mine own
 i'll have that doctor for my bedfellow
nerissa and i his clerk therefore be well advised
 how you do leave me to mine own protection
gratiano well do you so let not me take him then
 for if i do i'll mar the young clerk's pen
antonio i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
portia sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
bassanio portia forgive me this enforced wrong
 and in the hearing of these many friends
 i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
 wherein i see myself
portia mark you but that
 in both my eyes he doubly sees himself
 in each eye one swear by your double self
 and there's an oath of credit
bassanio nay but hear me
 pardon this fault and by my soul i swear
 i never more will break an oath with thee
antonio i once did lend my body for his wealth
 which but for him that had your husband's ring
 had quite miscarried i dare be bound again
 my soul upon the forfeit that your lord
 will never more break faith advisedly
portia then you shall be his surety give him this
 and bid him keep it better than the other
antonio here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring
bassanio by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor
portia i had it of him pardon me bassanio
 for by this ring the doctor lay with me
nerissa and pardon me my gentle gratiano
 for that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk
 in lieu of this last night did lie with me
gratiano why this is like the mending of highways
 in summer where the ways are fair enough
 what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
portia speak not so grossly you are all amazed
 here is a letter read it at your leisure
 it comes from padua from bellario
 there you shall find that portia was the doctor
 nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here
 shall witness i set forth as soon as you
 and even but now return'd i have not yet
 enter'd my house antonio you are welcome
 and i have better news in store for you
 than you expect unseal this letter soon
 there you shall find three of your argosies
 are richly come to harbour suddenly
 you shall not know by what strange accident
 i chanced on this letter
antonio i am dumb
bassanio were you the doctor and i knew you not
gratiano were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
nerissa ay but the clerk that never means to do it
 unless he live until he be a man
bassanio sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
 when i am absent then lie with my wife
antonio sweet lady you have given me life and living
 for here i read for certain that my ships
 are safely come to road
portia how now lorenzo
 my clerk hath some good comforts too for you
nerissa ay and i'll give them him without a fee
 there do i give to you and jessica
 from the rich jew a special deed of gift
 after his death of all he dies possess'd of
lorenzo fair ladies you drop manna in the way
 of starved people
portia it is almost morning
 and yet i am sure you are not satisfied
 of these events at full let us go in
 and charge us there upon inter'gatories
 and we will answer all things faithfully
gratiano let it be so the first inter'gatory
 that my nerissa shall be sworn on is
 whether till the next night she had rather stay
 or go to bed now being two hours to day
 but were the day come i should wish it dark
 that i were couching with the doctor's clerk
 well while i live i'll fear no other thing
 so sore as keeping safe nerissa's ring

 belly ashore at windsor how shall i be revenged

 your servant
ford sir i hear you are a scholari will be brief
 with youand you have been a man long known to me
 though i had never so good means as desire to make
 myself acquainted with you i shall discover a
 thing to you wherein i must very much lay open mine
 own imperfection but good sir john as you have
 one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded
 turn another into the register of your own that i
 may pass with a reproof the easier sith you
 yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender
falstaff very well sir proceed
ford there is a gentlewoman in this town her husband's
 name is ford
falstaff well sir
ford i have long loved her and i protest to you
 bestowed much on her followed her with a doting
 observance engrossed opportunities to meet her
 fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
 give me sight of her not only bought many presents
 to give her but have given largely to many to know
 what she would have given briefly i have pursued
 her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the
 wing of all occasions but whatsoever i have
 merited either in my mind or in my means meed
 i am sure i have received none unless experience
 be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite
 rate and that hath taught me to say this
 love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
 pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues'
falstaff have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands
ford never
falstaff have you importuned her to such a purpose
ford never
falstaff of what quality was your love then
ford like a fair house built on another man's ground so
 that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
 where i erected it
falstaff to what purpose have you unfolded this to me
ford when i have told you that i have told you all
 some say that though she appear honest to me yet in
 other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
 there is shrewd construction made of her now sir
 john here is the heart of my purpose you are a
 gentleman of excellent breeding admirable
 discourse of great admittance authentic in your
 place and person generally allowed for your many
 warlike courtlike and learned preparations
falstaff o sir
ford believe it for you know it there is money spend
 it spend it spend more spend all i have only
 give me so much of your time in exchange of it as
 to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
 ford's wife use your art of wooing win her to
 consent to you if any man may you may as soon as
 any
falstaff would it apply well to the vehemency of your
 affection that i should win what you would enjoy
 methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously
ford o understand my drift she dwells so securely on
 the excellency of her honour that the folly of my
 soul dares not present itself she is too bright to
 be looked against now could i could come to her
 with any detection in my hand my desires had
 instance and argument to commend themselves i
 could drive her then from the ward of her purity
 her reputation her marriagevow and a thousand
 other her defences which now are too too strongly
 embattled against me what say you to't sir john
falstaff master brook i will first make bold with your
 money next give me your hand and last as i am a
 gentleman you shall if you will enjoy ford's wife
ford o good sir
falstaff i say you shall
ford want no money sir john you shall want none
falstaff want no mistress ford master brook you shall want
 none i shall be with her i may tell you by her
 own appointment even as you came in to me her

ford that indeed sir john is my business
falstaff master brook i will not lie to you i was at her
 house the hour she appointed me
ford and sped you sir
falstaff very illfavoredly master brook
ford how so sir did she change her determination
falstaff no master brook but the peaking cornuto her
 husband master brook dwelling in a continual
 larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our
 encounter after we had embraced kissed protested
 and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy
 and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither
 provoked and instigated by his distemper and
 forsooth to search his house for his wife's love
ford what while you were there
falstaff while i was there
ford and did he search for you and could not find you
falstaff you shall hear as good luck would have it comes
 in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford's
 approach and in her invention and ford's wife's
 distraction they conveyed me into a buckbasket
ford a buckbasket
falstaff by the lord a buckbasket rammed me in with foul
 shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy
 napkins that master brook there was the rankest
 compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril
ford and how long lay you there
falstaff nay you shall hear master brook what i have
 suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good
 being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford's
 knaves his hinds were called forth by their
 mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
 datchetlane they took me on their shoulders met
 the jealous knave their master in the door who
 asked them once or twice what they had in their
 basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave
 would have searched it but fate ordaining he
 should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he
 for a search and away went i for foul clothes but
 mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs
 of three several deaths first an intolerable
 fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
 bellwether next to be compassed like a good
 bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to
 point heel to head and then to be stopped in
 like a strong distillation with stinking clothes
 that fretted in their own grease think of thata
 man of my kidneythink of thatthat am as subject
 to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution
 and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation
 and in the height of this bath when i was more than
 half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be
 thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot
 in that surge like a horseshoe think of
 thathissing hotthink of that master brook
ford in good sadness i am sorry that for my sake you
 have sufferd all this my suit then is desperate
 you'll undertake her no more
falstaff master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have
 been into thames ere i will leave her thus her
 husband is this morning gone abirding i have
 received from her another embassy of meeting twixt
 eight and nine is the hour master brook
ford tis past eight already sir
falstaff is it i will then address me to my appointment
 come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall
 know how i speed and the conclusion shall be
 crowned with your enjoying her adieu you shall
 have her master brook master brook you shall

 let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
 with some diffused song upon their sight
 we two in great amazedness will fly
 then let them all encircle him about

 and ask him why that hour of fairy revel
 in their so sacred paths he dares to tread
 in shape profane
mistress ford and till he tell the truth
 let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
 and burn him with their tapers
mistress page the truth being known
 we'll all present ourselves dishorn the spirit
 and mock him home to windsor

 that he shall likewise shuffle her away
 while other sports are tasking of their minds
 and at the deanery where a priest attends
 straight marry her to this her mother's plot
 she seemingly obedient likewise hath
 made promise to the doctor now thus it rests
 her father means she shall be all in white
 and in that habit when slender sees his time
 to take her by the hand and bid her go
 she shall go with him her mother hath intended
 the better to denote her to the doctor
 for they must all be mask'd and vizarded
 that quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed
 with ribands pendent flaring bout her head
 and when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
 to pinch her by the hand and on that token
 the maid hath given consent to go with him
host which means she to deceive father or mother
fenton both my good host to go along with me
 and here it rests that you'll procure the vicar
 to stay for me at church twixt twelve and one
 and in the lawful name of marrying

 bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest

falstaff seese and putter have i lived to stand at the
 taunt of one that makes fritters of english this

 virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders

 you would have married her most shamefully
 where there was no proportion held in love
 the truth is she and i long since contracted
 are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
 the offence is holy that she hath committed
 and this deceit loses the name of craft
 of disobedience or unduteous title
 since therein she doth evitate and shun
 a thousand irreligious cursed hours
 which forced marriage would have brought upon her
ford stand not amazed here is no remedy
 in love the heavens themselves do guide the state
 money buys lands and wives are sold by fate
falstaff i am glad though you have ta'en a special stand to
 strike at me that your arrow hath glanced

 what cannot be eschew'd must be embraced
falstaff when nightdogs run all sorts of deer are chased

scene i athens the palace of theseus
 enter theseus hippolyta philostrate and
 attendants
theseus now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour
 draws on apace four happy days bring in
 another moon but o methinks how slow
 this old moon wanes she lingers my desires
 like to a stepdame or a dowager
 long withering out a young man revenue
hippolyta four days will quickly steep themselves in night
 four nights will quickly dream away the time
 and then the moon like to a silver bow
 newbent in heaven shall behold the night
 of our solemnities
theseus go philostrate
 stir up the athenian youth to merriments
 awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
 turn melancholy forth to funerals
 the pale companion is not for our pomp
 exit philostrate
 hippolyta i woo'd thee with my sword
 and won thy love doing thee injuries
 but i will wed thee in another key
 with pomp with triumph and with revelling
 enter egeus hermia lysander and demetrius
egeus happy be theseus our renowned duke
theseus thanks good egeus what's the news with thee
egeus full of vexation come i with complaint
 against my child my daughter hermia
 stand forth demetrius my noble lord
 this man hath my consent to marry her
 stand forth lysander and my gracious duke
 this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child
 thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes
 and interchanged lovetokens with my child
 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
 with feigning voice verses of feigning love
 and stolen the impression of her fantasy
 with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
 knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
 of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth
 with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart
 turn'd her obedience which is due to me
 to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke
 be it so she will not here before your grace
 consent to marry with demetrius
 i beg the ancient privilege of athens
 as she is mine i may dispose of her
 which shall be either to this gentleman
 or to her death according to our law
 immediately provided in that case
theseus what say you hermia be advised fair maid
 to you your father should be as a god
 one that composed your beauties yea and one
 to whom you are but as a form in wax
 by him imprinted and within his power
 to leave the figure or disfigure it
 demetrius is a worthy gentleman
hermia so is lysander
theseus in himself he is
 but in this kind wanting your father's voice
 the other must be held the worthier
hermia i would my father look'd but with my eyes
theseus rather your eyes must with his judgment look
hermia i do entreat your grace to pardon me
 i know not by what power i am made bold
 nor how it may concern my modesty
 in such a presence here to plead my thoughts
 but i beseech your grace that i may know
 the worst that may befall me in this case
 if i refuse to wed demetrius
theseus either to die the death or to abjure
 for ever the society of men
 therefore fair hermia question your desires
 know of your youth examine well your blood
 whether if you yield not to your father's choice
 you can endure the livery of a nun
 for aye to be in shady cloister mew'd
 to live a barren sister all your life
 chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
 thriceblessed they that master so their blood
 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage
 but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
 than that which withering on the virgin thorn
 grows lives and dies in single blessedness
hermia so will i grow so live so die my lord
 ere i will my virgin patent up
 unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
 my soul consents not to give sovereignty
theseus take time to pause and by the nest new moon
 the sealingday betwixt my love and me
 for everlasting bond of fellowship
 upon that day either prepare to die
 for disobedience to your father's will
 or else to wed demetrius as he would
 or on diana's altar to protest
 for aye austerity and single life
demetrius relent sweet hermia and lysander yield
 thy crazed title to my certain right
lysander you have her father's love demetrius
 let me have hermia's do you marry him
egeus scornful lysander true he hath my love
 and what is mine my love shall render him
 and she is mine and all my right of her
 i do estate unto demetrius
lysander i am my lord as well derived as he
 as well possess'd my love is more than his
 my fortunes every way as fairly rank'd
 if not with vantage as demetrius'
 and which is more than all these boasts can be
 i am beloved of beauteous hermia
 why should not i then prosecute my right
 demetrius i'll avouch it to his head
 made love to nedar's daughter helena
 and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
 devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
 upon this spotted and inconstant man
theseus i must confess that i have heard so much
 and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
 but being overfull of selfaffairs
 my mind did lose it but demetrius come
 and come egeus you shall go with me
 i have some private schooling for you both
 for you fair hermia look you arm yourself
 to fit your fancies to your father's will
 or else the law of athens yields you up
 which by no means we may extenuate
 to death or to a vow of single life
 come my hippolyta what cheer my love
 demetrius and egeus go along
 i must employ you in some business
 against our nuptial and confer with you
 of something nearly that concerns yourselves
egeus with duty and desire we follow you
 exeunt all but lysander and hermia
lysander how now my love why is your cheek so pale
 how chance the roses there do fade so fast
hermia belike for want of rain which i could well
 beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
lysander ay me for aught that i could ever read
 could ever hear by tale or history
 the course of true love never did run smooth
 but either it was different in blood
hermia o cross too high to be enthrall'd to low
lysander or else misgraffed in respect of years
hermia o spite too old to be engaged to young
lysander or else it stood upon the choice of friends
hermia o hell to choose love by another's eyes
lysander or if there were a sympathy in choice
 war death or sickness did lay siege to it
 making it momentany as a sound
 swift as a shadow short as any dream
 brief as the lightning in the collied night
 that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
 and ere a man hath power to say behold'
 the jaws of darkness do devour it up
 so quick bright things come to confusion
hermia if then true lovers have been ever cross'd
 it stands as an edict in destiny
 then let us teach our trial patience
 because it is a customary cross
 as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
 wishes and tears poor fancy's followers
lysander a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia
 i have a widow aunt a dowager
 of great revenue and she hath no child
 from athens is her house remote seven leagues
 and she respects me as her only son
 there gentle hermia may i marry thee
 and to that place the sharp athenian law
 cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then
 steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night
 and in the wood a league without the town
 where i did meet thee once with helena
 to do observance to a morn of may
 there will i stay for thee
hermia my good lysander
 i swear to thee by cupid's strongest bow
 by his best arrow with the golden head
 by the simplicity of venus doves
 by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
 and by that fire which burn'd the carthage queen
 when the false troyan under sail was seen
 by all the vows that ever men have broke
 in number more than ever women spoke
 in that same place thou hast appointed me
 tomorrow truly will i meet with thee
lysander keep promise love look here comes helena
 enter helena
hermia god speed fair helena whither away
helena call you me fair that fair again unsay
 demetrius loves your fair o happy fair
 your eyes are lodestars and your tongue's sweet air
 more tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear
 when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
 sickness is catching o were favour so
 yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go
 my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
 my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody
 were the world mine demetrius being bated
 the rest i'd give to be to you translated
 o teach me how you look and with what art
 you sway the motion of demetrius heart
hermia i frown upon him yet he loves me still
helena o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
hermia i give him curses yet he gives me love
helena o that my prayers could such affection move
hermia the more i hate the more he follows me
helena the more i love the more he hateth me
hermia his folly helena is no fault of mine
helena none but your beauty would that fault were mine
hermia take comfort he no more shall see my face
 lysander and myself will fly this place
 before the time i did lysander see
 seem'd athens as a paradise to me
 o then what graces in my love do dwell
 that he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell
lysander helen to you our minds we will unfold
 tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold
 her silver visage in the watery glass
 decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
 a time that lovers flights doth still conceal
 through athens gates have we devised to steal
hermia and in the wood where often you and i
 upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie
 emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
 there my lysander and myself shall meet
 and thence from athens turn away our eyes
 to seek new friends and stranger companies
 farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
 and good luck grant thee thy demetrius
 keep word lysander we must starve our sight
 from lovers food till morrow deep midnight
lysander i will my hermia
 exit hermia
 helena adieu
 as you on him demetrius dote on you
 exit
helena how happy some o'er other some can be
 through athens i am thought as fair as she
 but what of that demetrius thinks not so
 he will not know what all but he do know
 and as he errs doting on hermia's eyes
 so i admiring of his qualities
 things base and vile folding no quantity
 love can transpose to form and dignity
 love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
 and therefore is wing'd cupid painted blind
 nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste
 wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
 and therefore is love said to be a child
 because in choice he is so oft beguiled
 as waggish boys in game themselves forswear
 so the boy love is perjured every where
 for ere demetrius look'd on hermia's eyne
 he hail'd down oaths that he was only mine
 and when this hail some heat from hermia felt
 so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt
 i will go tell him of fair hermia's flight
 then to the wood will he tomorrow night
 pursue her and for this intelligence
 if i have thanks it is a dear expense
 but herein mean i to enrich my pain
 to have his sight thither and back again

quince is all our company here

 thought fit through all athens to play in our
 interlude before the duke and the duchess on his
 weddingday at night
bottom first good peter quince say what the play treats

 to a point
quince marry our play is the most lamentable comedy and

 merry now good peter quince call forth your
 actors by the scroll masters spread yourselves
quince answer as i call you nick bottom the weaver
bottom ready name what part i am for and proceed

quince a lover that kills himself most gallant for love
bottom that will ask some tears in the true performing of
 it if i do it let the audience look to their
 eyes i will move storms i will condole in some
 measure to the rest yet my chief humour is for a
 tyrant i could play ercles rarely or a part to
 tear a cat in to make all split
 the raging rocks
 and shivering shocks
 shall break the locks
 of prison gates
 and phibbus car
 shall shine from far
 and make and mar
 the foolish fates
 this was lofty now name the rest of the players
 this is ercles vein a tyrant's vein a lover is
 more condoling

quince an you should do it too terribly you would fright
 the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek
 and that were enough to hang us all
all that would hang us every mother's son
bottom i grant you friends if that you should fright the
 ladies out of their wits they would have no more
 discretion but to hang us but i will aggravate my
 voice so that i will roar you as gently as any
 sucking dove i will roar you an twere any
 nightingale
quince you can play no part but pyramus for pyramus is a
 sweetfaced man a proper man as one shall see in a
 summer's day a most lovely gentlemanlike man

 obscenely and courageously take pains be perfect adieu

 a midsummer night's dream
act ii
scene i a wood near athens
 enter from opposite sides a fairy and puck
puck how now spirit whither wander you
fairy over hill over dale
 thorough bush thorough brier
 over park over pale
 thorough flood thorough fire
 i do wander everywhere
 swifter than the moon's sphere
 and i serve the fairy queen
 to dew her orbs upon the green
 the cowslips tall her pensioners be
 in their gold coats spots you see
 those be rubies fairy favours
 in those freckles live their savours
 i must go seek some dewdrops here
 and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear
 farewell thou lob of spirits i'll be gone
 our queen and all our elves come here anon
puck the king doth keep his revels here tonight
 take heed the queen come not within his sight
 for oberon is passing fell and wrath
 because that she as her attendant hath
 a lovely boy stolen from an indian king
 she never had so sweet a changeling
 and jealous oberon would have the child
 knight of his train to trace the forests wild
 but she perforce withholds the loved boy
 crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
 and now they never meet in grove or green
 by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
 but they do square that all their elves for fear
 creep into acorncups and hide them there
fairy either i mistake your shape and making quite
 or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
 call'd robin goodfellow are not you he
 that frights the maidens of the villagery
 skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
 and bootless make the breathless housewife churn
 and sometime make the drink to bear no barm
 mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm
 those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck
 you do their work and they shall have good luck
 are not you he
puck thou speak'st aright
 i am that merry wanderer of the night
 i jest to oberon and make him smile
 when i a fat and beanfed horse beguile
 neighing in likeness of a filly foal
 and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl
 in very likeness of a roasted crab
 and when she drinks against her lips i bob
 and on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale
 the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
 sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me
 then slip i from her bum down topples she
 and tailor cries and falls into a cough
 and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
 and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
 a merrier hour was never wasted there
 but room fairy here comes oberon
fairy and here my mistress would that he were gone
 enter from one side oberon with his train
 from the other titania with hers
oberon ill met by moonlight proud titania
titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence
 i have forsworn his bed and company
oberon tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord
titania then i must be thy lady but i know
 when thou hast stolen away from fairy land
 and in the shape of corin sat all day
 playing on pipes of corn and versing love
 to amorous phillida why art thou here
 come from the farthest steppe of india
 but that forsooth the bouncing amazon
 your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love
 to theseus must be wedded and you come
 to give their bed joy and prosperity
oberon how canst thou thus for shame titania
 glance at my credit with hippolyta
 knowing i know thy love to theseus
 didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
 from perigenia whom he ravished
 and make him with fair aegle break his faith
 with ariadne and antiopa
titania these are the forgeries of jealousy
 and never since the middle summer's spring
 met we on hill in dale forest or mead
 by paved fountain or by rushy brook
 or in the beached margent of the sea
 to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
 but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport
 therefore the winds piping to us in vain
 as in revenge have suck'd up from the sea
 contagious fogs which falling in the land
 have every pelting river made so proud
 that they have overborne their continents
 the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain
 the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
 hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard
 the fold stands empty in the drowned field
 and crows are fatted with the murrion flock
 the nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud
 and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
 for lack of tread are undistinguishable
 the human mortals want their winter here
 no night is now with hymn or carol blest
 therefore the moon the governess of floods
 pale in her anger washes all the air
 that rheumatic diseases do abound
 and thorough this distemperature we see
 the seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts
 far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
 and on old hiems thin and icy crown
 an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
 is as in mockery set the spring the summer
 the childing autumn angry winter change
 their wonted liveries and the mazed world
 by their increase now knows not which is which
 and this same progeny of evils comes
 from our debate from our dissension
 we are their parents and original
oberon do you amend it then it lies in you
 why should titania cross her oberon
 i do but beg a little changeling boy
 to be my henchman
titania set your heart at rest
 the fairy land buys not the child of me
 his mother was a votaress of my order
 and in the spiced indian air by night
 full often hath she gossip'd by my side
 and sat with me on neptune's yellow sands
 marking the embarked traders on the flood
 when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
 and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
 which she with pretty and with swimming gait
 followingher womb then rich with my young squire
 would imitate and sail upon the land
 to fetch me trifles and return again
 as from a voyage rich with merchandise
 but she being mortal of that boy did die
 and for her sake do i rear up her boy
 and for her sake i will not part with him
oberon how long within this wood intend you stay
titania perchance till after theseus weddingday
 if you will patiently dance in our round
 and see our moonlight revels go with us
 if not shun me and i will spare your haunts
oberon give me that boy and i will go with thee
titania not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away
 we shall chide downright if i longer stay
 exit titania with her train
oberon well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
 till i torment thee for this injury
 my gentle puck come hither thou rememberest
 since once i sat upon a promontory
 and heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
 uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
 that the rude sea grew civil at her song
 and certain stars shot madly from their spheres
 to hear the seamaid's music
puck i remember
oberon that very time i saw but thou couldst not
 flying between the cold moon and the earth
 cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took
 at a fair vestal throned by the west
 and loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow
 as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
 but i might see young cupid's fiery shaft
 quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon
 and the imperial votaress passed on
 in maiden meditation fancyfree
 yet mark'd i where the bolt of cupid fell
 it fell upon a little western flower
 before milkwhite now purple with love's wound
 and maidens call it loveinidleness
 fetch me that flower the herb i shew'd thee once
 the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
 will make or man or woman madly dote
 upon the next live creature that it sees
 fetch me this herb and be thou here again
 ere the leviathan can swim a league
puck i'll put a girdle round about the earth
 in forty minutes
 exit
oberon having once this juice
 i'll watch titania when she is asleep
 and drop the liquor of it in her eyes
 the next thing then she waking looks upon
 be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
 on meddling monkey or on busy ape
 she shall pursue it with the soul of love
 and ere i take this charm from off her sight
 as i can take it with another herb
 i'll make her render up her page to me
 but who comes here i am invisible
 and i will overhear their conference
 enter demetrius helena following him
demetrius i love thee not therefore pursue me not
 where is lysander and fair hermia
 the one i'll slay the other slayeth me
 thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood
 and here am i and wode within this wood
 because i cannot meet my hermia
 hence get thee gone and follow me no more
helena you draw me you hardhearted adamant
 but yet you draw not iron for my heart
 is true as steel leave you your power to draw
 and i shall have no power to follow you
demetrius do i entice you do i speak you fair
 or rather do i not in plainest truth
 tell you i do not nor i cannot love you
helena and even for that do i love you the more
 i am your spaniel and demetrius
 the more you beat me i will fawn on you
 use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
 neglect me lose me only give me leave
 unworthy as i am to follow you
 what worser place can i beg in your love
 and yet a place of high respect with me
 than to be used as you use your dog
demetrius tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
 for i am sick when i do look on thee
helena and i am sick when i look not on you
demetrius you do impeach your modesty too much
 to leave the city and commit yourself
 into the hands of one that loves you not
 to trust the opportunity of night
 and the ill counsel of a desert place
 with the rich worth of your virginity
helena your virtue is my privilege for that
 it is not night when i do see your face
 therefore i think i am not in the night
 nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
 for you in my respect are all the world
 then how can it be said i am alone
 when all the world is here to look on me
demetrius i'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
 and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
helena the wildest hath not such a heart as you
 run when you will the story shall be changed
 apollo flies and daphne holds the chase
 the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
 makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
 when cowardice pursues and valour flies
demetrius i will not stay thy questions let me go
 or if thou follow me do not believe
 but i shall do thee mischief in the wood
helena ay in the temple in the town the field
 you do me mischief fie demetrius
 your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
 we cannot fight for love as men may do
 we should be wood and were not made to woo
 exit demetrius
 i'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
 to die upon the hand i love so well
 exit
oberon fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
 thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
 reenter puck
 hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer
puck ay there it is
oberon i pray thee give it me
 i know a bank where the wild thyme blows
 where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
 quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine
 with sweet muskroses and with eglantine
 there sleeps titania sometime of the night
 lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight
 and there the snake throws her enamell'd skin
 weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
 and with the juice of this i'll streak her eyes
 and make her full of hateful fantasies
 take thou some of it and seek through this grove
 a sweet athenian lady is in love
 with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
 but do it when the next thing he espies
 may be the lady thou shalt know the man
 by the athenian garments he hath on
 effect it with some care that he may prove
 more fond on her than she upon her love
 and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
puck fear not my lord your servant shall do so

scene ii another part of the wood
 enter titania with her train
titania come now a roundel and a fairy song
 then for the third part of a minute hence
 some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds
 some war with reremice for their leathern wings
 to make my small elves coats and some keep back
 the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
 at our quaint spirits sing me now asleep
 then to your offices and let me rest
 the fairies sing
 you spotted snakes with double tongue
 thorny hedgehogs be not seen
 newts and blindworms do no wrong
 come not near our fairy queen
 philomel with melody
 sing in our sweet lullaby
 lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
 never harm
 nor spell nor charm
 come our lovely lady nigh
 so good night with lullaby
 weaving spiders come not here
 hence you longlegg'd spinners hence
 beetles black approach not near
 worm nor snail do no offence
 philomel with melody &c
fairy hence away now all is well
 one aloof stand sentinel
 exeunt fairies titania sleeps
 enter oberon and squeezes the flower on titania's eyelids
oberon what thou seest when thou dost wake
 do it for thy truelove take
 love and languish for his sake
 be it ounce or cat or bear
 pard or boar with bristled hair
 in thy eye that shall appear
 when thou wakest it is thy dear
 wake when some vile thing is near
 exit
 enter lysander and hermia
lysander fair love you faint with wandering in the wood
 and to speak troth i have forgot our way
 we'll rest us hermia if you think it good
 and tarry for the comfort of the day
hermia be it so lysander find you out a bed
 for i upon this bank will rest my head
lysander one turf shall serve as pillow for us both
 one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
hermia nay good lysander for my sake my dear
 lie further off yet do not lie so near
lysander o take the sense sweet of my innocence
 love takes the meaning in love's conference
 i mean that my heart unto yours is knit
 so that but one heart we can make of it
 two bosoms interchained with an oath
 so then two bosoms and a single troth
 then by your side no bedroom me deny
 for lying so hermia i do not lie
hermia lysander riddles very prettily
 now much beshrew my manners and my pride
 if hermia meant to say lysander lied
 but gentle friend for love and courtesy
 lie further off in human modesty
 such separation as may well be said
 becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
 so far be distant and good night sweet friend
 thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
lysander amen amen to that fair prayer say i
 and then end life when i end loyalty
 here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
hermia with half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd
 they sleep
 enter puck
puck through the forest have i gone
 but athenian found i none
 on whose eyes i might approve
 this flower's force in stirring love
 night and silencewho is here
 weeds of athens he doth wear
 this is he my master said
 despised the athenian maid
 and here the maiden sleeping sound
 on the dank and dirty ground
 pretty soul she durst not lie
 near this lacklove this killcourtesy
 churl upon thy eyes i throw
 all the power this charm doth owe
 when thou wakest let love forbid
 sleep his seat on thy eyelid
 so awake when i am gone
 for i must now to oberon
 exit
 enter demetrius and helena running
helena stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius
demetrius i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
helena o wilt thou darkling leave me do not so
demetrius stay on thy peril i alone will go
 exit
helena o i am out of breath in this fond chase
 the more my prayer the lesser is my grace
 happy is hermia wheresoe'er she lies
 for she hath blessed and attractive eyes
 how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears
 if so my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers
 no no i am as ugly as a bear
 for beasts that meet me run away for fear
 therefore no marvel though demetrius
 do as a monster fly my presence thus
 what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
 made me compare with hermia's sphery eyne
 but who is here lysander on the ground
 dead or asleep i see no blood no wound
 lysander if you live good sir awake
lysander awaking and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake
 transparent helena nature shows art
 that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
 where is demetrius o how fit a word
 is that vile name to perish on my sword
helena do not say so lysander say not so
 what though he love your hermia lord what though
 yet hermia still loves you then be content
lysander content with hermia no i do repent
 the tedious minutes i with her have spent
 not hermia but helena i love
 who will not change a raven for a dove
 the will of man is by his reason sway'd
 and reason says you are the worthier maid
 things growing are not ripe until their season
 so i being young till now ripe not to reason
 and touching now the point of human skill
 reason becomes the marshal to my will
 and leads me to your eyes where i o'erlook
 love's stories written in love's richest book
helena wherefore was i to this keen mockery born
 when at your hands did i deserve this scorn
 is't not enough is't not enough young man
 that i did never no nor never can
 deserve a sweet look from demetrius eye
 but you must flout my insufficiency
 good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
 in such disdainful manner me to woo
 but fare you well perforce i must confess
 i thought you lord of more true gentleness
 o that a lady of one man refused
 should of another therefore be abused
 exit
lysander she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there
 and never mayst thou come lysander near
 for as a surfeit of the sweetest things
 the deepest loathing to the stomach brings
 or as tie heresies that men do leave
 are hated most of those they did deceive
 so thou my surfeit and my heresy
 of all be hated but the most of me
 and all my powers address your love and might
 to honour helen and to be her knight
 exit
hermia awaking help me lysander help me do thy best
 to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
 ay me for pity what a dream was here
 lysander look how i do quake with fear
 methought a serpent eat my heart away
 and you sat smiling at his cruel pray
 lysander what removed lysander lord
 what out of hearing gone no sound no word
 alack where are you speak an if you hear
 speak of all loves i swoon almost with fear
 no then i well perceive you all not nigh
 either death or you i'll find immediately

bottom not a whit i have a device to make all well
 write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to
 say we will do no harm with our swords and that
 pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more
 better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not
 pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them
 out of fear

bottom nay you must name his name and half his face must
 be seen through the lion's neck and he himself

bottom a calendar a calendar look in the almanac find
 out moonshine find out moonshine
quince yes it doth shine that night
bottom why then may you leave a casement of the great
 chamber window where we play open and the moon
 may shine in at the casement
quince ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
 and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to
 present the person of moonshine then there is
 another thing we must have a wall in the great
 chamber for pyramus and thisby says the story did
 talk through the chink of a wall
snout you can never bring in a wall what say you bottom
bottom some man or other must present wall and let him
 have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast
 about him to signify wall and let him hold his
 fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus
 and thisby whisper
quince if that may be then all is well come sit down
 every mother's son and rehearse your parts

 speech enter into that brake and so every one
 according to his cue

titania i pray thee gentle mortal sing again
 mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note
 so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
 and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
 on the first view to say to swear i love thee
bottom methinks mistress you should have little reason
 for that and yet to say the truth reason and
 love keep little company together nowadays the
 more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
 make them friends nay i can gleek upon occasion
titania thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
bottom not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out
 of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn
titania out of this wood do not desire to go
 thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
 i am a spirit of no common rate
 the summer still doth tend upon my state
 and i do love thee therefore go with me
 i'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
 and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
 and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep

act iii
scene ii another part of the wood
 enter oberon
oberon i wonder if titania be awaked
 then what it was that next came in her eye
 which she must dote on in extremity
 enter puck
 here comes my messenger
 how now mad spirit
 what nightrule now about this haunted grove
puck my mistress with a monster is in love
 near to her close and consecrated bower
 while she was in her dull and sleeping hour
 a crew of patches rude mechanicals
 that work for bread upon athenian stalls
 were met together to rehearse a play
 intended for great theseus nuptialday
 the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
 who pyramus presented in their sport
 forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
 when i did him at this advantage take
 an ass's nole i fixed on his head
 anon his thisbe must be answered
 and forth my mimic comes when they him spy
 as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
 or russetpated choughs many in sort
 rising and cawing at the gun's report
 sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
 so at his sight away his fellows fly
 and at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls
 he murder cries and help from athens calls
 their sense thus weak lost with their fears
 thus strong
 made senseless things begin to do them wrong
 for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
 some sleeves some hats from yielders all
 things catch
 i led them on in this distracted fear
 and left sweet pyramus translated there
 when in that moment so it came to pass
 titania waked and straightway loved an ass
oberon this falls out better than i could devise
 but hast thou yet latch'd the athenian's eyes
 with the lovejuice as i did bid thee do
puck i took him sleepingthat is finish'd too
 and the athenian woman by his side
 that when he waked of force she must be eyed
 enter hermia and demetrius
oberon stand close this is the same athenian
puck this is the woman but not this the man
demetrius o why rebuke you him that loves you so
 lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
hermia now i but chide but i should use thee worse
 for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse
 if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep
 being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep
 and kill me too
 the sun was not so true unto the day
 as he to me would he have stolen away
 from sleeping hermia i'll believe as soon
 this whole earth may be bored and that the moon
 may through the centre creep and so displease
 her brother's noontide with antipodes
 it cannot be but thou hast murder'd him
 so should a murderer look so dead so grim
demetrius so should the murder'd look and so should i
 pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
 yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
 as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere
hermia what's this to my lysander where is he
 ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me
demetrius i had rather give his carcass to my hounds
hermia out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds
 of maiden's patience hast thou slain him then
 henceforth be never number'd among men
 o once tell true tell true even for my sake
 durst thou have look'd upon him being awake
 and hast thou kill'd him sleeping o brave touch
 could not a worm an adder do so much
 an adder did it for with doubler tongue
 than thine thou serpent never adder stung
demetrius you spend your passion on a misprised mood
 i am not guilty of lysander's blood
 nor is he dead for aught that i can tell
hermia i pray thee tell me then that he is well
demetrius an if i could what should i get therefore
hermia a privilege never to see me more
 and from thy hated presence part i so
 see me no more whether he be dead or no
 exit
demetrius there is no following her in this fierce vein
 here therefore for a while i will remain
 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
 for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
 which now in some slight measure it will pay
 if for his tender here i make some stay
 lies down and sleeps
oberon what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
 and laid the lovejuice on some truelove's sight
 of thy misprision must perforce ensue
 some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true
puck then fate o'errules that one man holding troth
 a million fail confounding oath on oath
oberon about the wood go swifter than the wind
 and helena of athens look thou find
 all fancysick she is and pale of cheer
 with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
 by some illusion see thou bring her here
 i'll charm his eyes against she do appear
puck i go i go look how i go
 swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow
 exit
oberon flower of this purple dye
 hit with cupid's archery
 sink in apple of his eye
 when his love he doth espy
 let her shine as gloriously
 as the venus of the sky
 when thou wakest if she be by
 beg of her for remedy
 reenter puck
puck captain of our fairy band
 helena is here at hand
 and the youth mistook by me
 pleading for a lover's fee
 shall we their fond pageant see
 lord what fools these mortals be
oberon stand aside the noise they make
 will cause demetrius to awake
puck then will two at once woo one
 that must needs be sport alone
 and those things do best please me
 that befal preposterously
 enter lysander and helena
lysander why should you think that i should woo in scorn
 scorn and derision never come in tears
 look when i vow i weep and vows so born
 in their nativity all truth appears
 how can these things in me seem scorn to you
 bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
helena you do advance your cunning more and more
 when truth kills truth o devilishholy fray
 these vows are hermia's will you give her o'er
 weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
 your vows to her and me put in two scales
 will even weigh and both as light as tales
lysander i had no judgment when to her i swore
helena nor none in my mind now you give her o'er
lysander demetrius loves her and he loves not you
demetrius awaking o helena goddess nymph perfect divine
 to what my love shall i compare thine eyne
 crystal is muddy o how ripe in show
 thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
 that pure congealed white high taurus snow
 fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
 when thou hold'st up thy hand o let me kiss
 this princess of pure white this seal of bliss
helena o spite o hell i see you all are bent
 to set against me for your merriment
 if you we re civil and knew courtesy
 you would not do me thus much injury
 can you not hate me as i know you do
 but you must join in souls to mock me too
 if you were men as men you are in show
 you would not use a gentle lady so
 to vow and swear and superpraise my parts
 when i am sure you hate me with your hearts
 you both are rivals and love hermia
 and now both rivals to mock helena
 a trim exploit a manly enterprise
 to conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
 with your derision none of noble sort
 would so offend a virgin and extort
 a poor soul's patience all to make you sport
lysander you are unkind demetrius be not so
 for you love hermia this you know i know
 and here with all good will with all my heart
 in hermia's love i yield you up my part
 and yours of helena to me bequeath
 whom i do love and will do till my death
helena never did mockers waste more idle breath
demetrius lysander keep thy hermia i will none
 if e'er i loved her all that love is gone
 my heart to her but as guestwise sojourn'd
 and now to helen is it home return'd
 there to remain
lysander helen it is not so
demetrius disparage not the faith thou dost not know
 lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
 look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
 reenter hermia
hermia dark night that from the eye his function takes
 the ear more quick of apprehension makes
 wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
 it pays the hearing double recompense
 thou art not by mine eye lysander found
 mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound
 but why unkindly didst thou leave me so
lysander why should he stay whom love doth press to go
hermia what love could press lysander from my side
lysander lysander's love that would not let him bide
 fair helena who more engilds the night
 than all you fiery oes and eyes of light
 why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know
 the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so
hermia you speak not as you think it cannot be
helena lo she is one of this confederacy
 now i perceive they have conjoin'd all three
 to fashion this false sport in spite of me
 injurious hermia most ungrateful maid
 have you conspired have you with these contrived
 to bait me with this foul derision
 is all the counsel that we two have shared
 the sisters vows the hours that we have spent
 when we have chid the hastyfooted time
 for parting uso is it all forgot
 all schooldays friendship childhood innocence
 we hermia like two artificial gods
 have with our needles created both one flower
 both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
 both warbling of one song both in one key
 as if our hands our sides voices and minds
 had been incorporate so we grow together
 like to a double cherry seeming parted
 but yet an union in partition
 two lovely berries moulded on one stem
 so with two seeming bodies but one heart
 two of the first like coats in heraldry
 due but to one and crowned with one crest
 and will you rent our ancient love asunder
 to join with men in scorning your poor friend
 it is not friendly tis not maidenly
 our sex as well as i may chide you for it
 though i alone do feel the injury
hermia i am amazed at your passionate words
 i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
helena have you not set lysander as in scorn
 to follow me and praise my eyes and face
 and made your other love demetrius
 who even but now did spurn me with his foot
 to call me goddess nymph divine and rare
 precious celestial wherefore speaks he this
 to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander
 deny your love so rich within his soul
 and tender me forsooth affection
 but by your setting on by your consent
 what thought i be not so in grace as you
 so hung upon with love so fortunate
 but miserable most to love unloved
 this you should pity rather than despise
hernia i understand not what you mean by this
helena ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
 make mouths upon me when i turn my back
 wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
 this sport well carried shall be chronicled
 if you have any pity grace or manners
 you would not make me such an argument
 but fare ye well tis partly my own fault
 which death or absence soon shall remedy
lysander stay gentle helena hear my excuse
 my love my life my soul fair helena
helena o excellent
hermia sweet do not scorn her so
demetrius if she cannot entreat i can compel
lysander thou canst compel no more than she entreat
 thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
 helen i love thee by my life i do
 i swear by that which i will lose for thee
 to prove him false that says i love thee not
demetrius i say i love thee more than he can do
lysander if thou say so withdraw and prove it too
demetrius quick come
hermia lysander whereto tends all this
lysander away you ethiope
demetrius no no he'll 
 seem to break loose take on as you would follow
 but yet come not you are a tame man go
lysander hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
 or i will shake thee from me like a serpent
hermia why are you grown so rude what change is this
 sweet love
lysander thy love out tawny tartar out
 out loathed medicine hated potion hence
hermia do you not jest
helena yes sooth and so do you
lysander demetrius i will keep my word with thee
demetrius i would i had your bond for i perceive
 a weak bond holds you i'll not trust your word
lysander what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead
 although i hate her i'll not harm her so
hermia what can you do me greater harm than hate
 hate me wherefore o me what news my love
 am not i hermia are not you lysander
 i am as fair now as i was erewhile
 since night you loved me yet since night you left
 me
 why then you left meo the gods forbid
 in earnest shall i say
lysander ay by my life
 and never did desire to see thee more
 therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
 be certain nothing truer tis no jest
 that i do hate thee and love helena
hermia o me you juggler you cankerblossom
 you thief of love what have you come by night
 and stolen my love's heart from him
helena fine i'faith
 have you no modesty no maiden shame
 no touch of bashfulness what will you tear
 impatient answers from my gentle tongue
 fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
hermia puppet why so ay that way goes the game
 now i perceive that she hath made compare
 between our statures she hath urged her height
 and with her personage her tall personage
 her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him
 and are you grown so high in his esteem
 because i am so dwarfish and so low
 how low am i thou painted maypole speak
 how low am i i am not yet so low
 but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
helena i pray you though you mock me gentlemen
 let her not hurt me i was never curst
 i have no gift at all in shrewishness
 i am a right maid for my cowardice
 let her not strike me you perhaps may think
 because she is something lower than myself
 that i can match her
hermia lower hark again
helena good hermia do not be so bitter with me
 i evermore did love you hermia
 did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you
 save that in love unto demetrius
 i told him of your stealth unto this wood
 he follow'd you for love i follow'd him
 but he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
 to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
 and now so you will let me quiet go
 to athens will i bear my folly back
 and follow you no further let me go
 you see how simple and how fond i am
hermia why get you gone who is't that hinders you
helena a foolish heart that i leave here behind
hermia what with lysander
helena with demetrius
lysander be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena
demetrius no sir she shall not though you take her part
helena o when she's angry she is keen and shrewd
 she was a vixen when she went to school
 and though she be but little she is fierce
hermia little again nothing but low and little'
 why will you suffer her to flout me thus
 let me come to her
lysander get you gone you dwarf
 you minimus of hindering knotgrass made
 you bead you acorn
demetrius you are too officious
 in her behalf that scorns your services
 let her alone speak not of helena
 take not her part for if thou dost intend
 never so little show of love to her
 thou shalt aby it
lysander now she holds me not
 now follow if thou darest to try whose right
 of thine or mine is most in helena
demetrius follow nay i'll go with thee cheek by jole
 exeunt lysander and demetrius
hermia you mistress all this coil is long of you
 nay go not back
helena i will not trust you i
 nor longer stay in your curst company
 your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
 my legs are longer though to run away
 exit
hermia i am amazed and know not what to say
 exit
oberon this is thy negligence still thou mistakest
 or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully
puck believe me king of shadows i mistook
 did not you tell me i should know the man
 by the athenian garment be had on
 and so far blameless proves my enterprise
 that i have nointed an athenian's eyes
 and so far am i glad it so did sort
 as this their jangling i esteem a sport
oberon thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight
 hie therefore robin overcast the night
 the starry welkin cover thou anon
 with drooping fog as black as acheron
 and lead these testy rivals so astray
 as one come not within another's way
 like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue
 then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong
 and sometime rail thou like demetrius
 and from each other look thou lead them thus
 till o'er their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep
 with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
 then crush this herb into lysander's eye
 whose liquor hath this virtuous property
 to take from thence all error with his might
 and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
 when they next wake all this derision
 shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
 and back to athens shall the lovers wend
 with league whose date till death shall never end
 whiles i in this affair do thee employ
 i'll to my queen and beg her indian boy
 and then i will her charmed eye release
 from monster's view and all things shall be peace
puck my fairy lord this must be done with haste
 for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger
 at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
 troop home to churchyards damned spirits all
 that in crossways and floods have burial
 already to their wormy beds are gone
 for fear lest day should look their shames upon
 they willfully themselves exile from light
 and must for aye consort with blackbrow'd night
oberon but we are spirits of another sort
 i with the morning's love have oft made sport
 and like a forester the groves may tread
 even till the eastern gate all fieryred
 opening on neptune with fair blessed beams
 turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
 but notwithstanding haste make no delay
 we may effect this business yet ere day
 exit
puck up and down up and down
 i will lead them up and down
 i am fear'd in field and town
 goblin lead them up and down
 here comes one
 reenter lysander
lysander where art thou proud demetrius speak thou now

puck thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
 telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars
 and wilt not come come recreant come thou child

 for if but once thou show me thy grey light
 i'll find demetrius and revenge this spite

 thou runn'st before me shifting every place
 and darest not stand nor look me in the face
 where art thou now
puck come hither i am here
demetrius nay then thou mock'st me thou shalt buy this dear
 if ever i thy face by daylight see
 now go thy way faintness constraineth me
 to measure out my length on this cold bed
 by day's approach look to be visited
 lies down and sleeps
 reenter helena
helena o weary night o long and tedious night
 abate thy hour shine comforts from the east
 that i may back to athens by daylight
 from these that my poor company detest
 and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye
 steal me awhile from mine own company
 lies down and sleeps
puck yet but three come one more
 two of both kinds make up four
 here she comes curst and sad
 cupid is a knavish lad
 thus to make poor females mad
 reenter hermia
hermia never so weary never so in woe
 bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
 i can no further crawl no further go
 my legs can keep no pace with my desires
 here will i rest me till the break of day
 heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray
 lies down and sleeps
puck on the ground
 sleep sound
 i'll apply
 to your eye
 gentle lover remedy
 squeezing the juice on lysander's eyes
 when thou wakest
 thou takest
 true delight
 in the sight
 of thy former lady's eye
 and the country proverb known
 that every man should take his own
 in your waking shall be shown
 jack shall have jill
 nought shall go ill
 the man shall have his mare again and all shall be well

 enter puck
oberon advancing welcome good robin
 see'st thou this sweet sight
 her dotage now i do begin to pity
 for meeting her of late behind the wood
 seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool
 i did upbraid her and fall out with her
 for she his hairy temples then had rounded
 with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
 and that same dew which sometime on the buds
 was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
 stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes
 like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
 when i had at my pleasure taunted her
 and she in mild terms begg'd my patience
 i then did ask of her her changeling child
 which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
 to bear him to my bower in fairy land
 and now i have the boy i will undo
 this hateful imperfection of her eyes
 and gentle puck take this transformed scalp
 from off the head of this athenian swain
 that he awaking when the other do
 may all to athens back again repair
 and think no more of this night's accidents
 but as the fierce vexation of a dream
 but first i will release the fairy queen
 be as thou wast wont to be
 see as thou wast wont to see
 dian's bud o'er cupid's flower
 hath such force and blessed power
 now my titania wake you my sweet queen
titania my oberon what visions have i seen
 methought i was enamour'd of an ass
oberon there lies your love
titania how came these things to pass
 o how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
oberon silence awhile robin take off this head
 titania music call and strike more dead
 than common sleep of all these five the sense
titania music ho music such as charmeth sleep
 music still
puck now when thou wakest with thine
 own fool's eyes peep
oberon sound music come my queen take hands with me
 and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
 now thou and i are new in amity
 and will tomorrow midnight solemnly
 dance in duke theseus house triumphantly
 and bless it to all fair prosperity
 there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
 wedded with theseus all in jollity
puck fairy king attend and mark
 i do hear the morning lark
oberon then my queen in silence sad
 trip we after the night's shade
 we the globe can compass soon
 swifter than the wandering moon
titania come my lord and in our flight
 tell me how it came this night
 that i sleeping here was found
 with these mortals on the ground
 exeunt
 horns winded within
 enter theseus hippolyta egeus and train
theseus go one of you find out the forester
 for now our observation is perform'd
 and since we have the vaward of the day
 my love shall hear the music of my hounds
 uncouple in the western valley let them go
 dispatch i say and find the forester
 exit an attendant
 we will fair queen up to the mountain's top
 and mark the musical confusion
 of hounds and echo in conjunction
hippolyta i was with hercules and cadmus once
 when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear
 with hounds of sparta never did i hear
 such gallant chiding for besides the groves
 the skies the fountains every region near
 seem'd all one mutual cry i never heard
 so musical a discord such sweet thunder
theseus my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind
 so flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung
 with ears that sweep away the morning dew
 crookknee'd and dewlapp'd like thessalian bulls
 slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells
 each under each a cry more tuneable
 was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn
 in crete in sparta nor in thessaly
 judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these
egeus my lord this is my daughter here asleep
 and this lysander this demetrius is
 this helena old nedar's helena
 i wonder of their being here together
theseus no doubt they rose up early to observe
 the rite of may and hearing our intent
 came here in grace our solemnity
 but speak egeus is not this the day
 that hermia should give answer of her choice
egeus it is my lord
theseus go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
 horns and shout within lysander demetrius
 helena and hermia wake and start up
 good morrow friends saint valentine is past
 begin these woodbirds but to couple now
lysander pardon my lord
theseus i pray you all stand up
 i know you two are rival enemies
 how comes this gentle concord in the world
 that hatred is so far from jealousy
 to sleep by hate and fear no enmity
lysander my lord i shall reply amazedly
 half sleep half waking but as yet i swear
 i cannot truly say how i came here
 but as i thinkfor truly would i speak
 and now do i bethink me so it is
 i came with hermia hither our intent
 was to be gone from athens where we might
 without the peril of the athenian law
egeus enough enough my lord you have enough
 i beg the law the law upon his head
 they would have stolen away they would demetrius
 thereby to have defeated you and me
 you of your wife and me of my consent
 of my consent that she should be your wife
demetrius my lord fair helen told me of their stealth
 of this their purpose hither to this wood
 and i in fury hither follow'd them
 fair helena in fancy following me
 but my good lord i wot not by what power
 but by some power it ismy love to hermia
 melted as the snow seems to me now
 as the remembrance of an idle gaud
 which in my childhood i did dote upon
 and all the faith the virtue of my heart
 the object and the pleasure of mine eye
 is only helena to her my lord
 was i betroth'd ere i saw hermia
 but like in sickness did i loathe this food
 but as in health come to my natural taste
 now i do wish it love it long for it
 and will for evermore be true to it
theseus fair lovers you are fortunately met
 of this discourse we more will hear anon
 egeus i will overbear your will
 for in the temple by and by with us
 these couples shall eternally be knit
 and for the morning now is something worn
 our purposed hunting shall be set aside
 away with us to athens three and three
 we'll hold a feast in great solemnity
 come hippolyta
 exeunt theseus hippolyta egeus and train
demetrius these things seem small and undistinguishable
hermia methinks i see these things with parted eye
 when every thing seems double
helena so methinks
 and i have found demetrius like a jewel
 mine own and not mine own
demetrius are you sure
 that we are awake it seems to me
 that yet we sleep we dream do not you think
 the duke was here and bid us follow him
hermia yea and my father
helena and hippolyta
lysander and he did bid us follow to the temple
demetrius why then we are awake let's follow him
 and by the way let us recount our dreams

 he will offer to say what methought i had the eye

 seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue
 to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream
 was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of
 this dream it shall be called bottom's dream

 latter end of a play before the duke

quince have you sent to bottom's house is he come home yet
starveling he cannot be heard of out of doubt he is
 transported
flute if he come not then the play is marred it goes
 not forward doth it
quince it is not possible you have not a man in all
 athens able to discharge pyramus but he
flute no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
 man in athens
quince yea and the best person too and he is a very
 paramour for a sweet voice
flute you must say paragon a paramour is god bless us
 a thing of naught

 comedy no more words away go away
 exeunt
 a midsummer night's dream
act v
scene i athens the palace of theseus
 enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and
 attendants
hippolyta tis strange my theseus that these
 lovers speak of
theseus more strange than true i never may believe
 these antique fables nor these fairy toys
 lovers and madmen have such seething brains
 such shaping fantasies that apprehend
 more than cool reason ever comprehends
 the lunatic the lover and the poet
 are of imagination all compact
 one sees more devils than vast hell can hold
 that is the madman the lover all as frantic
 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt
 the poet's eye in fine frenzy rolling
 doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
 and as imagination bodies forth
 the forms of things unknown the poet's pen
 turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
 a local habitation and a name
 such tricks hath strong imagination
 that if it would but apprehend some joy
 it comprehends some bringer of that joy
 or in the night imagining some fear
 how easy is a bush supposed a bear
hippolyta but all the story of the night told over
 and all their minds transfigured so together
 more witnesseth than fancy's images
 and grows to something of great constancy
 but howsoever strange and admirable
theseus here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
 enter lysander demetrius hermia and helena
 joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
 accompany your hearts
lysander more than to us
 wait in your royal walks your board your bed
theseus come now what masques what dances shall we have
 to wear away this long age of three hours
 between our aftersupper and bedtime
 where is our usual manager of mirth
 what revels are in hand is there no play
 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
 call philostrate
philostrate here mighty theseus
theseus say what abridgement have you for this evening
 what masque what music how shall we beguile
 the lazy time if not with some delight
philostrate there is a brief how many sports are ripe
 make choice of which your highness will see first
 giving a paper
theseus reads the battle with the centaurs to be sung
 by an athenian eunuch to the harp'
 we'll none of that that have i told my love
 in glory of my kinsman hercules
 reads
 the riot of the tipsy bacchanals
 tearing the thracian singer in their rage'
 that is an old device and it was play'd
 when i from thebes came last a conqueror
 reads
 the thrice three muses mourning for the death
 of learning late deceased in beggary'
 that is some satire keen and critical
 not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
 reads
 a tedious brief scene of young pyramus
 and his love thisbe very tragical mirth'
 merry and tragical tedious and brief
 that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
 how shall we find the concord of this discord
philostrate a play there is my lord some ten words long
 which is as brief as i have known a play
 but by ten words my lord it is too long
 which makes it tedious for in all the play
 there is not one word apt one player fitted
 and tragical my noble lord it is
 for pyramus therein doth kill himself
 which when i saw rehearsed i must confess
 made mine eyes water but more merry tears
 the passion of loud laughter never shed
theseus what are they that do play it
philostrate hardhanded men that work in athens here
 which never labour'd in their minds till now
 and now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
 with this same play against your nuptial
theseus and we will hear it
philostrate no my noble lord
 it is not for you i have heard it over
 and it is nothing nothing in the world
 unless you can find sport in their intents
 extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain
 to do you service
theseus i will hear that play
 for never anything can be amiss
 when simpleness and duty tender it
 go bring them in and take your places ladies
 exit philostrate
hippolyta i love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
 and duty in his service perishing
theseus why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
hippolyta he says they can do nothing in this kind
theseus the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
 our sport shall be to take what they mistake
 and what poor duty cannot do noble respect
 takes it in might not merit
 where i have come great clerks have purposed
 to greet me with premeditated welcomes
 where i have seen them shiver and look pale
 make periods in the midst of sentences
 throttle their practised accent in their fears
 and in conclusion dumbly have broke off
 not paying me a welcome trust me sweet
 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome
 and in the modesty of fearful duty
 i read as much as from the rattling tongue
 of saucy and audacious eloquence
 love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
 in least speak most to my capacity
 reenter philostrate
philostrate so please your grace the prologue is address'd
theseus let him approach
 flourish of trumpets
 enter quince for the prologue
prologue if we offend it is with our good will
 that you should think we come not to offend
 but with good will to show our simple skill
 that is the true beginning of our end
 consider then we come but in despite
 we do not come as minding to contest you
 our true intent is all for your delight
 we are not here that you should here repent you
 the actors are at hand and by their show
 you shall know all that you are like to know
theseus this fellow doth not stand upon points
lysander he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows
 not the stop a good moral my lord it is not
 enough to speak but to speak true
hippolyta indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
 on a recorder a sound but not in government
theseus his speech was like a tangled chain nothing
 impaired but all disordered who is next
 enter pyramus and thisbe wall moonshine and lion
prologue gentles perchance you wonder at this show
 but wonder on till truth make all things plain
 this man is pyramus if you would know
 this beauteous lady thisby is certain
 this man with lime and roughcast doth present
 wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder
 and through wall's chink poor souls they are content
 to whisper at the which let no man wonder
 this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
 presenteth moonshine for if you will know
 by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
 to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo
 this grisly beast which lion hight by name
 the trusty thisby coming first by night
 did scare away or rather did affright
 and as she fled her mantle she did fall
 which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
 anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall
 and finds his trusty thisby's mantle slain
 whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
 he bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast
 and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
 his dagger drew and died for all the rest
 let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain
 at large discourse while here they do remain
 exeunt prologue thisbe lion and moonshine
theseus i wonder if the lion be to speak
demetrius no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
wall in this same interlude it doth befall
 that i one snout by name present a wall
 and such a wall as i would have you think
 that had in it a crannied hole or chink
 through which the lovers pyramus and thisby
 did whisper often very secretly
 this loam this roughcast and this stone doth show
 that i am that same wall the truth is so
 and this the cranny is right and sinister
 through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
theseus would you desire lime and hair to speak better
demetrius it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard
 discourse my lord
 enter pyramus
theseus pyramus draws near the wall silence
pyramus o grimlook'd night o night with hue so black
 o night which ever art when day is not
 o night o night alack alack alack
 i fear my thisby's promise is forgot
 and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall
 that stand'st between her father's ground and mine
 thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall
 show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
 wall holds up his fingers
 thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this
 but what see i no thisby do i see
 o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss
 cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
theseus the wall methinks being sensible should curse again
pyramus no in truth sir he should not deceiving me'
 is thisby's cue she is to enter now and i am to
 spy her through the wall you shall see it will
 fall pat as i told you yonder she comes
 enter thisbe
thisbe o wall full often hast thou heard my moans
 for parting my fair pyramus and me
 my cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones
 thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
pyramus i see a voice now will i to the chink
 to spy an i can hear my thisby's face thisby
thisbe my love thou art my love i think
pyramus think what thou wilt i am thy lover's grace
 and like limander am i trusty still
thisbe and i like helen till the fates me kill
pyramus not shafalus to procrus was so true
thisbe as shafalus to procrus i to you
pyramus o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
thisbe i kiss the wall's hole not your lips at all
pyramus wilt thou at ninny's tomb meet me straightway
thisbe tide life tide death i come without delay
 exeunt pyramus and thisbe
wall thus have i wall my part discharged so
 and being done thus wall away doth go
 exit
theseus now is the mural down between the two neighbours
demetrius no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
 without warning
hippolyta this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard
theseus the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst
 are no worse if imagination amend them
hippolyta it must be your imagination then and not theirs
theseus if we imagine no worse of them than they of
 themselves they may pass for excellent men here
 come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
 enter lion and moonshine
lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
 the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
 may now perchance both quake and tremble here
 when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
 then know that i one snug the joiner am
 a lionfell nor else no lion's dam
 for if i should as lion come in strife
 into this place twere pity on my life
theseus a very gentle beast of a good conscience
demetrius the very best at a beast my lord that e'er i saw
lysander this lion is a very fox for his valour
theseus true and a goose for his discretion
demetrius not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his
 discretion and the fox carries the goose
theseus his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour
 for the goose carries not the fox it is well
 leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
demetrius he should have worn the horns on his head
theseus he is no crescent and his horns are
 invisible within the circumference
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
 myself the man i the moon do seem to be
theseus this is the greatest error of all the rest the man
 should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the
 man i the moon
demetrius he dares not come there for the candle for you
 see it is already in snuff
hippolyta i am aweary of this moon would he would change
theseus it appears by his small light of discretion that
 he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all
 reason we must stay the time
lysander proceed moon
moonshine all that i have to say is to tell you that the
 lanthorn is the moon i the man in the moon this
 thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog
demetrius why all these should be in the lanthorn for all
 these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe
 enter thisbe
thisbe this is old ninny's tomb where is my love
lion roaring oh
 thisbe runs off
demetrius well roared lion
theseus well run thisbe
hippolyta well shone moon truly the moon shines with a
 good grace
 the lion shakes thisbe's mantle and exit
theseus well moused lion
lysander and so the lion vanished
demetrius and then came pyramus
 enter pyramus
pyramus sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams
 i thank thee moon for shining now so bright
 for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
 i trust to take of truest thisby sight
 but stay o spite
 but mark poor knight
 what dreadful dole is here
 eyes do you see
 how can it be
 o dainty duck o dear
 thy mantle good
 what stain'd with blood
 approach ye furies fell
 o fates come come
 cut thread and thrum
 quail crush conclude and quell
theseus this passion and the death of a dear friend would
 go near to make a man look sad
hippolyta beshrew my heart but i pity the man
pyramus o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame
 since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear
 which isno nowhich was the fairest dame
 that lived that loved that liked that look'd
 with cheer
 come tears confound
 out sword and wound
 the pap of pyramus
 ay that left pap
 where heart doth hop
 stabs himself
 thus die i thus thus thus
 now am i dead
 now am i fled
 my soul is in the sky
 tongue lose thy light
 moon take thy flight
 exit moonshine
 now die die die die die
 dies
demetrius no die but an ace for him for he is but one
lysander less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
theseus with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and
 prove an ass
hippolyta how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes
 back and finds her lover
theseus she will find him by starlight here she comes and
 her passion ends the play
 reenter thisbe
hippolyta methinks she should not use a long one for such a
 pyramus i hope she will be brief
demetrius a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which
 thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us
 she for a woman god bless us
lysander she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
demetrius and thus she means videlicet
thisbe asleep my love
 what dead my dove
 o pyramus arise
 speak speak quite dumb
 dead dead a tomb
 must cover thy sweet eyes
 these my lips
 this cherry nose
 these yellow cowslip cheeks
 are gone are gone
 lovers make moan
 his eyes were green as leeks
 o sisters three
 come come to me
 with hands as pale as milk
 lay them in gore
 since you have shore
 with shears his thread of silk
 tongue not a word
 come trusty sword
 come blade my breast imbrue
 stabs herself
 and farewell friends
 thus thisby ends
 adieu adieu adieu
 dies
theseus moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead
demetrius ay and wall too
bottom starting up no assure you the wall is down that
 parted their fathers will it please you to see the
 epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two
 of our company
theseus no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no
 excuse never excuse for when the players are all
 dead there needs none to be blamed marry if he
 that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself
 in thisbe's garter it would have been a fine
 tragedy and so it is truly and very notably
 discharged but come your bergomask let your
 epilogue alone
 a dance
 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
 lovers to bed tis almost fairy time
 i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
 as much as we this night have overwatch'd
 this palpablegross play hath well beguiled
 the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed
 a fortnight hold we this solemnity
 in nightly revels and new jollity
 exeunt
 enter puck
puck now the hungry lion roars
 and the wolf behowls the moon
 whilst the heavy ploughman snores
 all with weary task fordone
 now the wasted brands do glow
 whilst the screechowl screeching loud
 puts the wretch that lies in woe
 in remembrance of a shroud
 now it is the time of night
 that the graves all gaping wide
 every one lets forth his sprite
 in the churchway paths to glide
 and we fairies that do run
 by the triple hecate's team
 from the presence of the sun
 following darkness like a dream
 now are frolic not a mouse
 shall disturb this hallow'd house
 i am sent with broom before
 to sweep the dust behind the door
 enter oberon and titania with their train
oberon through the house give gathering light
 by the dead and drowsy fire
 every elf and fairy sprite
 hop as light as bird from brier
 and this ditty after me
 sing and dance it trippingly
titania first rehearse your song by rote
 to each word a warbling note
 hand in hand with fairy grace
 will we sing and bless this place
 song and dance
oberon now until the break of day
 through this house each fairy stray
 to the best bridebed will we
 which by us shall blessed be
 and the issue there create
 ever shall be fortunate
 so shall all the couples three
 ever true in loving be
 and the blots of nature's hand
 shall not in their issue stand
 never mole hare lip nor scar
 nor mark prodigious such as are
 despised in nativity
 shall upon their children be
 with this fielddew consecrate
 every fairy take his gait
 and each several chamber bless
 through this palace with sweet peace
 and the owner of it blest
 ever shall in safety rest
 trip away make no stay
 meet me all by break of day
 exeunt oberon titania and train
puck if we shadows have offended
 think but this and all is mended
 that you have but slumber'd here
 while these visions did appear
 and this weak and idle theme
 no more yielding but a dream
 gentles do not reprehend
 if you pardon we will mend
 and as i am an honest puck
 if we have unearned luck
 now to scape the serpent's tongue
 we will make amends ere long
 else the puck a liar call
 so good night unto you all
 give me your hands if we be friends
 and robin shall restore amends

 much ado about nothing
act i
scene i before leonato's house
 enter leonato hero and beatrice with a
 messenger
leonato i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon
 comes this night to messina
messenger he is very near by this he was not three leagues off
 when i left him
leonato how many gentlemen have you lost in this action
messenger but few of any sort and none of name
leonato a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
 home full numbers i find here that don peter hath
 bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio
messenger much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
 don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the
 promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb
 the feats of a lion he hath indeed better
 bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
 tell you how
leonato he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much
 glad of it
messenger i have already delivered him letters and there
 appears much joy in him even so much that joy could
 not show itself modest enough without a badge of
 bitterness
leonato did he break out into tears
messenger in great measure
leonato a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces
 truer than those that are so washed how much
 better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping
beatrice i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the
 wars or no
messenger i know none of that name lady there was none such
 in the army of any sort
leonato what is he that you ask for niece
hero my cousin means signior benedick of padua
messenger o he's returned and as pleasant as ever he was
beatrice he set up his bills here in messina and challenged
 cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading
 the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged
 him at the birdbolt i pray you how many hath he
 killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath
 he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing
leonato faith niece you tax signior benedick too much
 but he'll be meet with you i doubt it not
messenger he hath done good service lady in these wars
beatrice you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it
 he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an
 excellent stomach
messenger and a good soldier too lady
beatrice and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord
messenger a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all
 honourable virtues
beatrice it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man
 but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal
leonato you must not sir mistake my niece there is a
 kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her
 they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
 between them
beatrice alas he gets nothing by that in our last
 conflict four of his five wits went halting off and
 now is the whole man governed with one so that if
 he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him
 bear it for a difference between himself and his
 horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left
 to be known a reasonable creature who is his
 companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother
messenger is't possible
beatrice very easily possible he wears his faith but as
 the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the
 next block
messenger i see lady the gentleman is not in your books
beatrice no an he were i would burn my study but i pray
 you who is his companion is there no young
 squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil
messenger he is most in the company of the right noble claudio
beatrice o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he
 is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker
 runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if
 he have caught the benedick it will cost him a
 thousand pound ere a be cured
messenger i will hold friends with you lady
beatrice do good friend
leonato you will never run mad niece
beatrice no not till a hot january
messenger don pedro is approached
 enter don pedro don john claudio benedick
 and balthasar
don pedro good signior leonato you are come to meet your
 trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid
 cost and you encounter it
leonato never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
 your grace for trouble being gone comfort should
 remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides
 and happiness takes his leave
don pedro you embrace your charge too willingly i think this
 is your daughter
leonato her mother hath many times told me so
benedick were you in doubt sir that you asked her
leonato signior benedick no for then were you a child
don pedro you have it full benedick we may guess by this
 what you are being a man truly the lady fathers
 herself be happy lady for you are like an
 honourable father
benedick if signior leonato be her father she would not
 have his head on her shoulders for all messina as
 like him as she is
beatrice i wonder that you will still be talking signior
 benedick nobody marks you
benedick what my dear lady disdain are you yet living
beatrice is it possible disdain should die while she hath
 such meet food to feed it as signior benedick
 courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come
 in her presence
benedick then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i
 am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i
 would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard
 heart for truly i love none
beatrice a dear happiness to women they would else have
 been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god
 and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i
 had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
 swear he loves me
benedick god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some
 gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
 scratched face
beatrice scratching could not make it worse an twere such
 a face as yours were
benedick well you are a rare parrotteacher
beatrice a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
benedick i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and
 so good a continuer but keep your way i god's
 name i have done
beatrice you always end with a jade's trick i know you of old
don pedro that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio
 and signior benedick my dear friend leonato hath
 invited you all i tell him we shall stay here at
 the least a month and he heartily prays some
 occasion may detain us longer i dare swear he is no
 hypocrite but prays from his heart
leonato if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn
 to don john
 let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to
 the prince your brother i owe you all duty
don john i thank you i am not of many words but i thank
 you
leonato please it your grace lead on
don pedro your hand leonato we will go together
 exeunt all except benedick and claudio
claudio benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato
benedick i noted her not but i looked on her
claudio is she not a modest young lady
benedick do you question me as an honest man should do for
 my simple true judgment or would you have me speak
 after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex
claudio no i pray thee speak in sober judgment
benedick why i faith methinks she's too low for a high
 praise too brown for a fair praise and too little
 for a great praise only this commendation i can
 afford her that were she other than she is she
 were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i
 do not like her
claudio thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me
 truly how thou likest her
benedick would you buy her that you inquire after her
claudio can the world buy such a jewel
benedick yea and a case to put it into but speak you this
 with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack
 to tell us cupid is a good harefinder and vulcan a
 rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take
 you to go in the song
claudio in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i
 looked on
benedick i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such
 matter there's her cousin an she were not
 possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty
 as the first of may doth the last of december but i
 hope you have no intent to turn husband have you
claudio i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the
 contrary if hero would be my wife
benedick is't come to this in faith hath not the world
 one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion
 shall i never see a bachelor of threescore again
 go to i faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
 into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away
 sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you
 reenter don pedro
don pedro what secret hath held you here that you followed
 not to leonato's
benedick i would your grace would constrain me to tell
don pedro i charge thee on thy allegiance
benedick you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb
 man i would have you think so but on my
 allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is
 in love with who now that is your grace's part
 mark how short his answer iswith hero leonato's
 short daughter
claudio if this were so so were it uttered
benedick like the old tale my lord it is not so nor
 twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be
 so'
claudio if my passion change not shortly god forbid it
 should be otherwise
don pedro amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
claudio you speak this to fetch me in my lord
don pedro by my troth i speak my thought
claudio and in faith my lord i spoke mine
benedick and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine
claudio that i love her i feel
don pedro that she is worthy i know
benedick that i neither feel how she should be loved nor
 know how she should be worthy is the opinion that
 fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake
don pedro thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
 of beauty
claudio and never could maintain his part but in the force
 of his will
benedick that a woman conceived me i thank her that she
 brought me up i likewise give her most humble
 thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my
 forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick
 all women shall pardon me because i will not do
 them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the
 right to trust none and the fine is for the which
 i may go the finer i will live a bachelor
don pedro i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love
benedick with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord
 not with love prove that ever i lose more blood
 with love than i will get again with drinking pick
 out mine eyes with a balladmaker's pen and hang me
 up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of
 blind cupid
don pedro well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou
 wilt prove a notable argument
benedick if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
 at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on
 the shoulder and called adam
don pedro well as time shall try in time the savage bull
 doth bear the yoke'
benedick the savage bull may but if ever the sensible
 benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set
 them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted
 and in such great letters as they write here is
 good horse to hire let them signify under my sign
 here you may see benedick the married man'
claudio if this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad
don pedro nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in
 venice thou wilt quake for this shortly
benedick i look for an earthquake too then
don pedro well you temporize with the hours in the
 meantime good signior benedick repair to
 leonato's commend me to him and tell him i will
 not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made
 great preparation
benedick i have almost matter enough in me for such an
 embassage and so i commit you
claudio to the tuition of god from my house if i had it
don pedro the sixth of july your loving friend benedick
benedick nay mock not mock not the body of your
 discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and
 the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere
 you flout old ends any further examine your
 conscience and so i leave you
 exit
claudio my liege your highness now may do me good
don pedro my love is thine to teach teach it but how
 and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
 any hard lesson that may do thee good
claudio hath leonato any son my lord
don pedro no child but hero she's his only heir
 dost thou affect her claudio
claudio o my lord
 when you went onward on this ended action
 i look'd upon her with a soldier's eye
 that liked but had a rougher task in hand
 than to drive liking to the name of love
 but now i am return'd and that warthoughts
 have left their places vacant in their rooms
 come thronging soft and delicate desires
 all prompting me how fair young hero is
 saying i liked her ere i went to wars
don pedro thou wilt be like a lover presently
 and tire the hearer with a book of words
 if thou dost love fair hero cherish it
 and i will break with her and with her father
 and thou shalt have her was't not to this end
 that thou began'st to twist so fine a story
claudio how sweetly you do minister to love
 that know love's grief by his complexion
 but lest my liking might too sudden seem
 i would have salved it with a longer treatise
don pedro what need the bridge much broader than the flood
 the fairest grant is the necessity
 look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest
 and i will fit thee with the remedy
 i know we shall have revelling tonight
 i will assume thy part in some disguise
 and tell fair hero i am claudio
 and in her bosom i'll unclasp my heart
 and take her hearing prisoner with the force
 and strong encounter of my amorous tale
 then after to her father will i break
 and the conclusion is she shall be thine
 in practise let us put it presently

scene ii a room in leonato's house
 enter leonato and antonio meeting
leonato how now brother where is my cousin your son
 hath he provided this music
antonio he is very busy about it but brother i can tell
 you strange news that you yet dreamt not of
leonato are they good

 cover they show well outward the prince and count
 claudio walking in a thickpleached alley in mine
 orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine
 the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my
 niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
 this night in a dance and if he found her
 accordant he meant to take the present time by the
 top and instantly break with you of it
leonato hath the fellow any wit that told you this
antonio a good sharp fellow i will send for him and
 question him yourself
leonato no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear

scene iii the same
 enter don john and conrade
conrade what the goodyear my lord why are you thus out
 of measure sad
don john there is no measure in the occasion that breeds
 therefore the sadness is without limit
conrade you should hear reason
don john and when i have heard it what blessing brings it
conrade if not a present remedy at least a patient
 sufferance
don john i wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art
 born under saturn goest about to apply a moral
 medicine to a mortifying mischief i cannot hide
 what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile
 at no man's jests eat when i have stomach and wait
 for no man's leisure sleep when i am drowsy and
 tend on no man's business laugh when i am merry and
 claw no man in his humour
conrade yea but you must not make the full show of this
 till you may do it without controlment you have of
 late stood out against your brother and he hath
 ta'en you newly into his grace where it is
 impossible you should take true root but by the
 fair weather that you make yourself it is needful
 that you frame the season for your own harvest
don john i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
 his grace and it better fits my blood to be
 disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
 love from any in this though i cannot be said to
 be a flattering honest man it must not be denied
 but i am a plaindealing villain i am trusted with
 a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i
 have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my
 mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do
 my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and
 seek not to alter me
conrade can you make no use of your discontent
don john i make all use of it for i use it only
 who comes here
 enter borachio
 what news borachio
borachio i came yonder from a great supper the prince your
 brother is royally entertained by leonato and i
 can give you intelligence of an intended marriage
don john will it serve for any model to build mischief on
 what is he for a fool that betroths himself to
 unquietness
borachio marry it is your brother's right hand
don john who the most exquisite claudio
borachio even he
don john a proper squire and who and who which way looks
 he
borachio marry on hero the daughter and heir of leonato
don john a very forward marchchick how came you to this
borachio being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a
 musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand
 in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the
 arras and there heard it agreed upon that the
 prince should woo hero for himself and having
 obtained her give her to count claudio
don john come come let us thither this may prove food to
 my displeasure that young startup hath all the
 glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i
 bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me

don john let us to the great supper their cheer is the
 greater that i am subdued would the cook were of
 my mind shall we go prove what's to be done

 much ado about nothing
act ii
scene i a hall in leonato's house
 enter leonato antonio hero beatrice and others
leonato was not count john here at supper
antonio i saw him not
beatrice how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see
 him but i am heartburned an hour after
hero he is of a very melancholy disposition
beatrice he were an excellent man that were made just in the
 midway between him and benedick the one is too
 like an image and says nothing and the other too
 like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling
leonato then half signior benedick's tongue in count john's
 mouth and half count john's melancholy in signior
 benedick's face
beatrice with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money
 enough in his purse such a man would win any woman
 in the world if a could get her goodwill
leonato by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a
 husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
antonio in faith she's too curst
beatrice too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god's
 sending that way for it is said god sends a curst
 cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none
leonato so by being too curst god will send you no horns
beatrice just if he send me no husband for the which
 blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and
 evening lord i could not endure a husband with a
 beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen
leonato you may light on a husband that hath no beard
beatrice what should i do with him dress him in my apparel
 and make him my waitinggentlewoman he that hath a
 beard is more than a youth and he that hath no
 beard is less than a man and he that is more than
 a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
 man i am not for him therefore i will even take
 sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his
 apes into hell
leonato well then go you into hell
beatrice no but to the gate and there will the devil meet
 me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and
 say get you to heaven beatrice get you to
 heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver
 i up my apes and away to saint peter for the
 heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and
 there live we as merry as the day is long
antonio to hero well niece i trust you will be ruled
 by your father
beatrice yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
 and say father as it please you but yet for all
 that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else
 make another curtsy and say father as it please
 me'
leonato well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband
beatrice not till god make men of some other metal than
 earth would it not grieve a woman to be
 overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make
 an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
 no uncle i'll none adam's sons are my brethren
 and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred
leonato daughter remember what i told you if the prince
 do solicit you in that kind you know your answer
beatrice the fault will be in the music cousin if you be
 not wooed in good time if the prince be too
 important tell him there is measure in every thing
 and so dance out the answer for hear me hero
 wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig
 a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot
 and hasty like a scotch jig and full as
 fantastical the wedding mannerlymodest as a
 measure full of state and ancientry and then comes
 repentance and with his bad legs falls into the
 cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave
leonato cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly
beatrice i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight
leonato the revellers are entering brother make good room
 all put on their masks
 enter don pedro claudio benedick balthasar
 don john borachio margaret ursula and others masked
don pedro lady will you walk about with your friend
hero so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing
 i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away
don pedro with me in your company
hero i may say so when i please
don pedro and when please you to say so
hero when i like your favour for god defend the lute
 should be like the case
don pedro my visor is philemon's roof within the house is jove
hero why then your visor should be thatched
don pedro speak low if you speak love
 drawing her aside
balthasar well i would you did like me
margaret so would not i for your own sake for i have many
 illqualities
balthasar which is one
margaret i say my prayers aloud
balthasar i love you the better the hearers may cry amen
margaret god match me with a good dancer
balthasar amen
margaret and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is
 done answer clerk
balthasar no more words the clerk is answered
ursula i know you well enough you are signior antonio
antonio at a word i am not
ursula i know you by the waggling of your head
antonio to tell you true i counterfeit him
ursula you could never do him so illwell unless you were
 the very man here's his dry hand up and down you
 are he you are he
antonio at a word i am not
ursula come come do you think i do not know you by your
 excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to
 mum you are he graces will appear and there's an
 end
beatrice will you not tell me who told you so
benedick no you shall pardon me
beatrice nor will you not tell me who you are
benedick not now
beatrice that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit
 out of the hundred merry tales'well this was
 signior benedick that said so
benedick what's he
beatrice i am sure you know him well enough
benedick not i believe me
beatrice did he never make you laugh
benedick i pray you what is he
beatrice why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool
 only his gift is in devising impossible slanders
 none but libertines delight in him and the
 commendation is not in his wit but in his villany
 for he both pleases men and angers them and then
 they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in
 the fleet i would he had boarded me
benedick when i know the gentleman i'll tell him what you say
beatrice do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me
 which peradventure not marked or not laughed at
 strikes him into melancholy and then there's a
 partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no
 supper that night
 music
 we must follow the leaders
benedick in every good thing
beatrice nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at
 the next turning
 dance then exeunt all except don john borachio
 and claudio
don john sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath
 withdrawn her father to break with him about it
 the ladies follow her and but one visor remains
borachio and that is claudio i know him by his bearing
don john are not you signior benedick
claudio you know me well i am he
don john signior you are very near my brother in his love
 he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him
 from her she is no equal for his birth you may
 do the part of an honest man in it
claudio how know you he loves her
don john i heard him swear his affection
borachio so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight
don john come let us to the banquet
 exeunt don john and borachio
claudio thus answer i in the name of benedick
 but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio
 tis certain so the prince wooes for himself
 friendship is constant in all other things
 save in the office and affairs of love
 therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
 let every eye negotiate for itself
 and trust no agent for beauty is a witch
 against whose charms faith melteth into blood
 this is an accident of hourly proof
 which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero
 reenter benedick
benedick count claudio
claudio yea the same
benedick come will you go with me
claudio whither
benedick even to the next willow about your own business
 county what fashion will you wear the garland of
 about your neck like an usurer's chain or under
 your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you must wear
 it one way for the prince hath got your hero
claudio i wish him joy of her
benedick why that's spoken like an honest drovier so they
 sell bullocks but did you think the prince would
 have served you thus
claudio i pray you leave me
benedick ho now you strike like the blind man twas the
 boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post
claudio if it will not be i'll leave you
 exit
benedick alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges
 but that my lady beatrice should know me and not
 know me the prince's fool ha it may be i go
 under that title because i am merry yea but so i
 am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it
 is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice
 that puts the world into her person and so gives me
 out well i'll be revenged as i may
 reenter don pedro
don pedro now signior where's the count did you see him
benedick troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame
 i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
 warren i told him and i think i told him true
 that your grace had got the good will of this young
 lady and i offered him my company to a willowtree
 either to make him a garland as being forsaken or
 to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped
don pedro to be whipped what's his fault
benedick the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being
 overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his
 companion and he steals it
don pedro wilt thou make a trust a transgression the
 transgression is in the stealer
benedick yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made
 and the garland too for the garland he might have
 worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on
 you who as i take it have stolen his birds nest
don pedro i will but teach them to sing and restore them to
 the owner
benedick if their singing answer your saying by my faith
 you say honestly
don pedro the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the
 gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
 wronged by you
benedick o she misused me past the endurance of a block
 an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
 answered her my very visor began to assume life and
 scold with her she told me not thinking i had been
 myself that i was the prince's jester that i was
 duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest
 with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood
 like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at
 me she speaks poniards and every word stabs
 if her breath were as terrible as her terminations
 there were no living near her she would infect to
 the north star i would not marry her though she
 were endowed with all that adam bad left him before
 he transgressed she would have made hercules have
 turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make
 the fire too come talk not of her you shall find
 her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god
 some scholar would conjure her for certainly while
 she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
 sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they
 would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror
 and perturbation follows her
don pedro look here she comes
 enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato
benedick will your grace command me any service to the
 world's end i will go on the slightest errand now
 to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on
 i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the
 furthest inch of asia bring you the length of
 prester john's foot fetch you a hair off the great
 cham's beard do you any embassage to the pigmies
 rather than hold three words conference with this
 harpy you have no employment for me
don pedro none but to desire your good company
benedick o god sir here's a dish i love not i cannot
 endure my lady tongue
 exit
don pedro come lady come you have lost the heart of
 signior benedick
beatrice indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave
 him use for it a double heart for his single one
 marry once before he won it of me with false dice
 therefore your grace may well say i have lost it
don pedro you have put him down lady you have put him down
beatrice so i would not he should do me my lord lest i
 should prove the mother of fools i have brought
 count claudio whom you sent me to seek
don pedro why how now count wherefore are you sad
claudio not sad my lord
don pedro how then sick
claudio neither my lord
beatrice the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor
 well but civil count civil as an orange and
 something of that jealous complexion
don pedro i faith lady i think your blazon to be true
 though i'll be sworn if he be so his conceit is
 false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and
 fair hero is won i have broke with her father
 and his good will obtained name the day of
 marriage and god give thee joy
leonato count take of me my daughter and with her my
 fortunes his grace hath made the match and an
 grace say amen to it
beatrice speak count tis your cue
claudio silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were
 but little happy if i could say how much lady as
 you are mine i am yours i give away myself for
 you and dote upon the exchange
beatrice speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth
 with a kiss and let not him speak neither
don pedro in faith lady you have a merry heart
beatrice yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on
 the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his
 ear that he is in her heart
claudio and so she doth cousin
beatrice good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the
 world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a
 corner and cry heighho for a husband
don pedro lady beatrice i will get you one
beatrice i would rather have one of your father's getting
 hath your grace ne'er a brother like you your
 father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them
don pedro will you have me lady
beatrice no my lord unless i might have another for
 workingdays your grace is too costly to wear
 every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i
 was born to speak all mirth and no matter
don pedro your silence most offends me and to be merry best
 becomes you for out of question you were born in
 a merry hour
beatrice no sure my lord my mother cried but then there
 was a star danced and under that was i born
 cousins god give you joy
leonato niece will you look to those things i told you of
beatrice i cry you mercy uncle by your grace's pardon
 exit
don pedro by my troth a pleasantspirited lady
leonato there's little of the melancholy element in her my
 lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and
 not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say
 she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
 herself with laughing
don pedro she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
leonato o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit
don pedro she were an excellent wife for benedict
leonato o lord my lord if they were but a week married
 they would talk themselves mad
don pedro county claudio when mean you to go to church
claudio tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love
 have all his rites
leonato not till monday my dear son which is hence a just
 sevennight and a time too brief too to have all
 things answer my mind
don pedro come you shake the head at so long a breathing
 but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go
 dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of
 hercules labours which is to bring signior
 benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of
 affection the one with the other i would fain have
 it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if
 you three will but minister such assistance as i
 shall give you direction
leonato my lord i am for you though it cost me ten
 nights watchings
claudio and i my lord
don pedro and you too gentle hero
hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my
 cousin to a good husband
don pedro and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
 i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble
 strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty i
 will teach you how to humour your cousin that she
 shall fall in love with benedick and i with your
 two helps will so practise on benedick that in
 despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he
 shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this
 cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be
 ours for we are the only lovegods go in with me
 and i will tell you my drift
 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act ii
scene ii the same
 enter don john and borachio
don john it is so the count claudio shall marry the
 daughter of leonato
borachio yea my lord but i can cross it
don john any bar any cross any impediment will be
 medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him
 and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
 evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage
borachio not honestly my lord but so covertly that no
 dishonesty shall appear in me
don john show me briefly how
borachio i think i told your lordship a year since how much
 i am in the favour of margaret the waiting
 gentlewoman to hero
don john i remember
borachio i can at any unseasonable instant of the night
 appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window
don john what life is in that to be the death of this marriage
borachio the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to
 the prince your brother spare not to tell him that
 he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
 claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold
 upto a contaminated stale such a one as hero
don john what proof shall i make of that
borachio proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio
 to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any
 other issue
don john only to despite them i will endeavour any thing
borachio go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and
 the count claudio alone tell them that you know
 that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the
 prince and claudio asin love of your brother's
 honour who hath made this match and his friend's
 reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the
 semblance of a maidthat you have discovered
 thus they will scarcely believe this without trial
 offer them instances which shall bear no less
 likelihood than to see me at her chamberwindow
 hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me
 claudio and bring them to see this the very night
 before the intended weddingfor in the meantime i
 will so fashion the matter that hero shall be
 absentand there shall appear such seeming truth
 of hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
 assurance and all the preparation overthrown
don john grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put
 it in practise be cunning in the working this and
 thy fee is a thousand ducats
borachio be you constant in the accusation and my cunning
 shall not shame me
don john i will presently go learn their day of marriage
 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act ii
scene iii leonato's orchard
 enter benedick
benedick boy
 enter boy
boy signior
benedick in my chamberwindow lies a book bring it hither
 to me in the orchard
boy i am here already sir
benedick i know that but i would have thee hence and here again
 exit boy
 i do much wonder that one man seeing how much
 another man is a fool when he dedicates his
 behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at
 such shallow follies in others become the argument
 of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man
 is claudio i have known when there was no music
 with him but the drum and the fife and now had he
 rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known
 when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a
 good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake
 carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to
 speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man
 and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his
 words are a very fantastical banquet just so many
 strange dishes may i be so converted and see with
 these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not
 be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but
 i'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster
 of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman
 is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am
 well another virtuous yet i am well but till all
 graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in
 my grace rich she shall be that's certain wise
 or i'll none virtuous or i'll never cheapen her
 fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not
 near me noble or not i for an angel of good
 discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall
 be of what colour it please god ha the prince and
 monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour
 withdraws
 enter don pedro claudio and leonato
don pedro come shall we hear this music
claudio yea my good lord how still the evening is
 as hush'd on purpose to grace harmony
don pedro see you where benedick hath hid himself
claudio o very well my lord the music ended
 we'll fit the kidfox with a pennyworth
 enter balthasar with music
don pedro come balthasar we'll hear that song again
balthasar o good my lord tax not so bad a voice
 to slander music any more than once
don pedro it is the witness still of excellency
 to put a strange face on his own perfection
 i pray thee sing and let me woo no more
balthasar because you talk of wooing i will sing
 since many a wooer doth commence his suit
 to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes
 yet will he swear he loves
don pedro now pray thee come
 or if thou wilt hold longer argument
 do it in notes
balthasar note this before my notes
 there's not a note of mine that's worth the noting
don pedro why these are very crotchets that he speaks
 note notes forsooth and nothing
 air
benedick now divine air now is his soul ravished is it
 not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out
 of men's bodies well a horn for my money when
 all's done
 the song
balthasar sigh no more ladies sigh no more
 men were deceivers ever
 one foot in sea and one on shore
 to one thing constant never
 then sigh not so but let them go
 and be you blithe and bonny
 converting all your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny nonny
 sing no more ditties sing no moe
 of dumps so dull and heavy
 the fraud of men was ever so
 since summer first was leafy
 then sigh not so &c
don pedro by my troth a good song
balthasar and an ill singer my lord
don pedro ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift
benedick an he had been a dog that should have howled thus
 they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad
 voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the
 nightraven come what plague could have come after
 it
don pedro yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee
 get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we
 would have it at the lady hero's chamberwindow
balthasar the best i can my lord
don pedro do so farewell
 exit balthasar
 come hither leonato what was it you told me of
 today that your niece beatrice was in love with
 signior benedick
claudio o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did
 never think that lady would have loved any man
leonato no nor i neither but most wonderful that she
 should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in
 all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor
benedick is't possible sits the wind in that corner
leonato by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think
 of it but that she loves him with an enraged
 affection it is past the infinite of thought
don pedro may be she doth but counterfeit
claudio faith like enough
leonato o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of
 passion came so near the life of passion as she
 discovers it
don pedro why what effects of passion shows she
claudio bait the hook well this fish will bite
leonato what effects my lord she will sit you you heard
 my daughter tell you how
claudio she did indeed
don pedro how how pray you you amaze me i would have i
 thought her spirit had been invincible against all
 assaults of affection
leonato i would have sworn it had my lord especially
 against benedick
benedick i should think this a gull but that the
 whitebearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot
 sure hide himself in such reverence
claudio he hath ta'en the infection hold it up
don pedro hath she made her affection known to benedick
leonato no and swears she never will that's her torment
claudio tis true indeed so your daughter says shall
 i says she that have so oft encountered him
 with scorn write to him that i love him'
leonato this says she now when she is beginning to write to
 him for she'll be up twenty times a night and
 there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
 sheet of paper my daughter tells us all
claudio now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a
 pretty jest your daughter told us of
leonato o when she had writ it and was reading it over she
 found benedick and beatrice between the sheet
claudio that
leonato o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence
 railed at herself that she should be so immodest
 to write to one that she knew would flout her i
 measure him says she by my own spirit for i
 should flout him if he writ to me yea though i
 love him i should'
claudio then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs
 beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o
 sweet benedick god give me patience'
leonato she doth indeed my daughter says so and the
 ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
 is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
 to herself it is very true
don pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some
 other if she will not discover it
claudio to what end he would make but a sport of it and
 torment the poor lady worse
don pedro an he should it were an alms to hang him she's an
 excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion
 she is virtuous
claudio and she is exceeding wise
don pedro in every thing but in loving benedick
leonato o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender
 a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
 the victory i am sorry for her as i have just
 cause being her uncle and her guardian
don pedro i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would
 have daffed all other respects and made her half
 myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear
 what a will say
leonato were it good think you
claudio hero thinks surely she will die for she says she
 will die if he love her not and she will die ere
 she make her love known and she will die if he woo
 her rather than she will bate one breath of her
 accustomed crossness
don pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her
 love tis very possible he'll scorn it for the
 man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit
claudio he is a very proper man
don pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness
claudio before god and in my mind very wise
don pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
claudio and i take him to be valiant
don pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of
 quarrels you may say he is wise for either he
 avoids them with great discretion or undertakes
 them with a most christianlike fear
leonato if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace
 if he break the peace he ought to enter into a
 quarrel with fear and trembling
don pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god
 howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
 he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall
 we go seek benedick and tell him of her love
claudio never tell him my lord let her wear it out with
 good counsel
leonato nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first
don pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter
 let it cool the while i love benedick well and i
 could wish he would modestly examine himself to see
 how much he is unworthy so good a lady
leonato my lord will you walk dinner is ready
claudio if he do not dote on her upon this i will never
 trust my expectation
don pedro let there be the same net spread for her and that
 must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the
 sport will be when they hold one an opinion of
 another's dotage and no such matter that's the
 scene that i would see which will be merely a
 dumbshow let us send her to call him in to dinner
 exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato
benedick coming forward this can be no trick the
 conference was sadly borne they have the truth of
 this from hero they seem to pity the lady it
 seems her affections have their full bent love me
 why it must be requited i hear how i am censured
 they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive
 the love come from her they say too that she will
 rather die than give any sign of affection i did
 never think to marry i must not seem proud happy
 are they that hear their detractions and can put
 them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a
 truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis
 so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving
 me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor
 no great argument of her folly for i will be
 horribly in love with her i may chance have some
 odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me
 because i have railed so long against marriage but
 doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat
 in his youth that he cannot endure in his age
 shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
 the brain awe a man from the career of his humour
 no the world must be peopled when i said i would
 die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i
 were married here comes beatrice by this day
 she's a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in
 her
 enter beatrice
beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner
benedick fair beatrice i thank you for your pains
beatrice i took no more pains for those thanks than you take
 pains to thank me if it had been painful i would
 not have come
benedick you take pleasure then in the message
beatrice yea just so much as you may take upon a knife's
 point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach
 signior fare you well
 exit
benedick ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in
 to dinner there's a double meaning in that i took
 no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
 to thank me that's as much as to say any pains
 that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do
 not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not
 love her i am a jew i will go get her picture
 exit
 much ado about nothing
act iii
scene i leonato's garden
 enter hero margaret and ursula
hero good margaret run thee to the parlor
 there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice
 proposing with the prince and claudio
 whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula
 walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
 is all of her say that thou overheard'st us
 and bid her steal into the pleached bower
 where honeysuckles ripen'd by the sun
 forbid the sun to enter like favourites
 made proud by princes that advance their pride
 against that power that bred it there will she hide her
 to listen our purpose this is thy office
 bear thee well in it and leave us alone
margaret i'll make her come i warrant you presently
 exit
hero now ursula when beatrice doth come
 as we do trace this alley up and down
 our talk must only be of benedick
 when i do name him let it be thy part
 to praise him more than ever man did merit
 my talk to thee must be how benedick
 is sick in love with beatrice of this matter
 is little cupid's crafty arrow made
 that only wounds by hearsay
 enter beatrice behind
 now begin
 for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs
 close by the ground to hear our conference
ursula the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
 cut with her golden oars the silver stream
 and greedily devour the treacherous bait
 so angle we for beatrice who even now
 is couched in the woodbine coverture
 fear you not my part of the dialogue
hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
 of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
 approaching the bower
 no truly ursula she is too disdainful
 i know her spirits are as coy and wild
 as haggerds of the rock
ursula but are you sure
 that benedick loves beatrice so entirely
hero so says the prince and my newtrothed lord
ursula and did they bid you tell her of it madam
hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it
 but i persuaded them if they loved benedick
 to wish him wrestle with affection
 and never to let beatrice know of it
ursula why did you so doth not the gentleman
 deserve as full as fortunate a bed
 as ever beatrice shall couch upon
hero o god of love i know he doth deserve
 as much as may be yielded to a man
 but nature never framed a woman's heart
 of prouder stuff than that of beatrice
 disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
 misprising what they look on and her wit
 values itself so highly that to her
 all matter else seems weak she cannot love
 nor take no shape nor project of affection
 she is so selfendeared
ursula sure i think so
 and therefore certainly it were not good
 she knew his love lest she make sport at it
hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man
 how wise how noble young how rarely featured
 but she would spell him backward if fairfaced
 she would swear the gentleman should be her sister
 if black why nature drawing of an antique
 made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded
 if low an agate very vilely cut
 if speaking why a vane blown with all winds
 if silent why a block moved with none
 so turns she every man the wrong side out
 and never gives to truth and virtue that
 which simpleness and merit purchaseth
ursula sure sure such carping is not commendable
hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions
 as beatrice is cannot be commendable
 but who dare tell her so if i should speak
 she would mock me into air o she would laugh me
 out of myself press me to death with wit
 therefore let benedick like cover'd fire
 consume away in sighs waste inwardly
 it were a better death than die with mocks
 which is as bad as die with tickling
ursula yet tell her of it hear what she will say
hero no rather i will go to benedick
 and counsel him to fight against his passion
 and truly i'll devise some honest slanders
 to stain my cousin with one doth not know
 how much an ill word may empoison liking
ursula o do not do your cousin such a wrong
 she cannot be so much without true judgment
 having so swift and excellent a wit
 as she is prized to haveas to refuse
 so rare a gentleman as signior benedick
hero he is the only man of italy
 always excepted my dear claudio
ursula i pray you be not angry with me madam
 speaking my fancy signior benedick
 for shape for bearing argument and valour
 goes foremost in report through italy
hero indeed he hath an excellent good name
ursula his excellence did earn it ere he had it
 when are you married madam
hero why every day tomorrow come go in
 i'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel
 which is the best to furnish me tomorrow
ursula she's limed i warrant you we have caught her madam
hero if it proves so then loving goes by haps
 some cupid kills with arrows some with traps
 exeunt hero and ursula
beatrice coming forward
 what fire is in mine ears can this be true
 stand i condemn'd for pride and scorn so much
 contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
 no glory lives behind the back of such
 and benedick love on i will requite thee
 taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
 if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
 to bind our loves up in a holy band
 for others say thou dost deserve and i
 believe it better than reportingly

scene ii a room in leonato's house
 enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato
don pedro i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and
 then go i toward arragon
claudio i'll bring you thither my lord if you'll
 vouchsafe me
don pedro nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
 of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
 and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold
 with benedick for his company for from the crown
 of his head to the sole of his foot he is all
 mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid's
 bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at
 him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
 tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his
 tongue speaks
benedick gallants i am not as i have been
leonato so say i methinks you are sadder
claudio i hope he be in love
don pedro hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in
 him to be truly touched with love if he be sad
 he wants money
benedick i have the toothache
don pedro draw it
benedick hang it
claudio you must hang it first and draw it afterwards
don pedro what sigh for the toothache
leonato where is but a humour or a worm
benedick well every one can master a grief but he that has
 it
claudio yet say i he is in love
don pedro there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be
 a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be
 a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the
 shape of two countries at once as a german from
 the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from
 the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy
 to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no
 fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is
claudio if he be not in love with some woman there is no
 believing old signs a brushes his hat o'
 mornings what should that bode
don pedro hath any man seen him at the barber's
claudio no but the barber's man hath been seen with him
 and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
 stuffed tennisballs
leonato indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard
don pedro nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him
 out by that
claudio that's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love
don pedro the greatest note of it is his melancholy
claudio and when was he wont to wash his face
don pedro yea or to paint himself for the which i hear
 what they say of him
claudio nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into
 a lutestring and now governed by stops
don pedro indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude
 conclude he is in love
claudio nay but i know who loves him
don pedro that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not
claudio yes and his ill conditions and in despite of
 all dies for him
don pedro she shall be buried with her face upwards
benedick yet is this no charm for the toothache old
 signior walk aside with me i have studied eight
 or nine wise words to speak to you which these
 hobbyhorses must not hear
 exeunt benedick and leonato
don pedro for my life to break with him about beatrice
claudio tis even so hero and margaret have by this
 played their parts with beatrice and then the two
 bears will not bite one another when they meet
 enter don john
don john my lord and brother god save you
don pedro good den brother
don john if your leisure served i would speak with you
don pedro in private
don john if it please you yet count claudio may hear for
 what i would speak of concerns him
don pedro what's the matter
don john to claudio means your lordship to be married
 tomorrow
don pedro you know he does
don john i know not that when he knows what i know
claudio if there be any impediment i pray you discover it
don john you may think i love you not let that appear
 hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will
 manifest for my brother i think he holds you
 well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
 your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and
 labour ill bestowed
don pedro why what's the matter
don john i came hither to tell you and circumstances
 shortened for she has been too long a talking of
 the lady is disloyal
claudio who hero
don pedro even she leonato's hero your hero every man's hero
claudio disloyal
don john the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i
 could say she were worse think you of a worse
 title and i will fit her to it wonder not till
 further warrant go but with me tonight you shall
 see her chamberwindow entered even the night
 before her weddingday if you love her then
 tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour
 to change your mind
claudio may this be so
don pedro i will not think it
don john if you dare not trust that you see confess not
 that you know if you will follow me i will show
 you enough and when you have seen more and heard
 more proceed accordingly
claudio if i see any thing tonight why i should not marry
 her tomorrow in the congregation where i should
 wed there will i shame her
don pedro and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join
 with thee to disgrace her
don john i will disparage her no farther till you are my
 witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and
 let the issue show itself
don pedro o day untowardly turned
claudio o mischief strangely thwarting
don john o plague right well prevented so will you say when
 you have seen the sequel

scene iii a street
 enter dogberry and verges with the watch
dogberry are you good men and true
verges yea or else it were pity but they should suffer
 salvation body and soul
dogberry nay that were a punishment too good for them if
 they should have any allegiance in them being
 chosen for the prince's watch
verges well give them their charge neighbour dogberry
dogberry first who think you the most desertless man to be
 constable
first watchman hugh otecake sir or george seacole for they can
 write and read
dogberry come hither neighbour seacole god hath blessed
 you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is
 the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature
second watchman both which master constable
dogberry you have i knew it would be your answer well
 for your favour sir why give god thanks and make
 no boast of it and for your writing and reading
 let that appear when there is no need of such
 vanity you are thought here to be the most
 senseless and fit man for the constable of the
 watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your
 charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are
 to bid any man stand in the prince's name
second watchman how if a will not stand
dogberry why then take no note of him but let him go and
 presently call the rest of the watch together and
 thank god you are rid of a knave
verges if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none
 of the prince's subjects
dogberry true and they are to meddle with none but the
 prince's subjects you shall also make no noise in
 the streets for for the watch to babble and to
 talk is most tolerable and not to be endured
watchman we will rather sleep than talk we know what
 belongs to a watch
dogberry why you speak like an ancient and most quiet
 watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should
 offend only have a care that your bills be not
 stolen well you are to call at all the
 alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
watchman how if they will not
dogberry why then let them alone till they are sober if
 they make you not then the better answer you may
 say they are not the men you took them for
watchman well sir
dogberry if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue
 of your office to be no true man and for such
 kind of men the less you meddle or make with them
 why the more is for your honesty
watchman if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay
 hands on him
dogberry truly by your office you may but i think they
 that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable
 way for you if you do take a thief is to let him
 show himself what he is and steal out of your company
verges you have been always called a merciful man partner
dogberry truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more
 a man who hath any honesty in him
verges if you hear a child cry in the night you must call
 to the nurse and bid her still it
watchman how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
dogberry why then depart in peace and let the child wake
 her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her
 lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats
verges tis very true
dogberry this is the end of the chargeyou constable are
 to present the prince's own person if you meet the
 prince in the night you may stay him
verges nay by'r our lady that i think a cannot
dogberry five shillings to one on't with any man that knows
 the statutes he may stay him marry not without
 the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought
 to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a
 man against his will
verges by'r lady i think it be so
dogberry ha ha ha well masters good night an there be
 any matter of weight chances call up me keep your
 fellows counsels and your own and good night
 come neighbour
watchman well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here
 upon the churchbench till two and then all to bed
dogberry one word more honest neighbours i pray you watch
 about signior leonato's door for the wedding being
 there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight
 adieu be vigitant i beseech you
 exeunt dogberry and verges
 enter borachio and conrade
borachio what conrade
watchman aside peace stir not
borachio conrade i say
conrade here man i am at thy elbow
borachio mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a
 scab follow
conrade i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward
 with thy tale
borachio stand thee close then under this penthouse for
 it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard
 utter all to thee
watchman aside some treason masters yet stand close
borachio therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats
conrade is it possible that any villany should be so dear
borachio thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
 villany should be so rich for when rich villains
 have need of poor ones poor ones may make what
 price they will
conrade i wonder at it
borachio that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that
 the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is
 nothing to a man
conrade yes it is apparel
borachio i mean the fashion
conrade yes the fashion is the fashion
borachio tush i may as well say the fool's the fool but
 seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
 is
watchman aside i know that deformed a has been a vile
 thief this seven year a goes up and down like a
 gentleman i remember his name
borachio didst thou not hear somebody
conrade no twas the vane on the house
borachio seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this
 fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot
 bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty
 sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh's soldiers
 in the reeky painting sometime like god bel's
 priests in the old churchwindow sometime like the
 shaven hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry
 where his codpiece seems as massy as his club
conrade all this i see and i see that the fashion wears
 out more apparel than the man but art not thou
 thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast
 shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion
borachio not so neither but know that i have tonight
 wooed margaret the lady hero's gentlewoman by the
 name of hero she leans me out at her mistress'
 chamberwindow bids me a thousand times good
 nighti tell this tale vilelyi should first
 tell thee how the prince claudio and my master
 planted and placed and possessed by my master don
 john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter
conrade and thought they margaret was hero
borachio two of them did the prince and claudio but the
 devil my master knew she was margaret and partly
 by his oaths which first possessed them partly by
 the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly
 by my villany which did confirm any slander that
 don john had made away went claudio enraged swore
 he would meet her as he was appointed next morning
 at the temple and there before the whole
 congregation shame her with what he saw o'er night
 and send her home again without a husband
first watchman we charge you in the prince's name stand
second watchman call up the right master constable we have here
 recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
 ever was known in the commonwealth
first watchman and one deformed is one of them i know him a'
 wears a lock
conrade masters masters
second watchman you'll be made bring deformed forth i warrant you
conrade masters
first watchman never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us
borachio we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken
 up of these men's bills
conrade a commodity in question i warrant you come we'll obey you

act iv
scene i a church
 enter don pedro don john leonato friar francis
 claudio benedick hero beatrice and attendants
leonato come friar francis be brief only to the plain
 form of marriage and you shall recount their
 particular duties afterwards
friar francis you come hither my lord to marry this lady
claudio no
leonato to be married to her friar you come to marry her
friar francis lady you come hither to be married to this count
hero i do
friar francis if either of you know any inward impediment why you
 should not be conjoined charge you on your souls
 to utter it
claudio know you any hero
hero none my lord
friar francis know you any count
leonato i dare make his answer none
claudio o what men dare do what men may do what men daily
 do not knowing what they do
benedick how now interjections why then some be of
 laughing as ah ha he
claudio stand thee by friar father by your leave
 will you with free and unconstrained soul
 give me this maid your daughter
leonato as freely son as god did give her me
claudio and what have i to give you back whose worth
 may counterpoise this rich and precious gift
don pedro nothing unless you render her again
claudio sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
 there leonato take her back again
 give not this rotten orange to your friend
 she's but the sign and semblance of her honour
 behold how like a maid she blushes here
 o what authority and show of truth
 can cunning sin cover itself withal
 comes not that blood as modest evidence
 to witness simple virtue would you not swear
 all you that see her that she were a maid
 by these exterior shows but she is none
 she knows the heat of a luxurious bed
 her blush is guiltiness not modesty
leonato what do you mean my lord
claudio not to be married
 not to knit my soul to an approved wanton
leonato dear my lord if you in your own proof
 have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth
 and made defeat of her virginity
claudio i know what you would say if i have known her
 you will say she did embrace me as a husband
 and so extenuate the forehand sin
 no leonato
 i never tempted her with word too large
 but as a brother to his sister show'd
 bashful sincerity and comely love
hero and seem'd i ever otherwise to you
claudio out on thee seeming i will write against it
 you seem to me as dian in her orb
 as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
 but you are more intemperate in your blood
 than venus or those pamper'd animals
 that rage in savage sensuality
hero is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
leonato sweet prince why speak not you
don pedro what should i speak
 i stand dishonour'd that have gone about
 to link my dear friend to a common stale
leonato are these things spoken or do i but dream
don john sir they are spoken and these things are true
benedick this looks not like a nuptial
hero true o god
claudio leonato stand i here
 is this the prince is this the prince's brother
 is this face hero's are our eyes our own
leonato all this is so but what of this my lord
claudio let me but move one question to your daughter
 and by that fatherly and kindly power
 that you have in her bid her answer truly
leonato i charge thee do so as thou art my child
hero o god defend me how am i beset
 what kind of catechising call you this
claudio to make you answer truly to your name
hero is it not hero who can blot that name
 with any just reproach
claudio marry that can hero
 hero itself can blot out hero's virtue
 what man was he talk'd with you yesternight
 out at your window betwixt twelve and one
 now if you are a maid answer to this
hero i talk'd with no man at that hour my lord
don pedro why then are you no maiden leonato
 i am sorry you must hear upon mine honour
 myself my brother and this grieved count
 did see her hear her at that hour last night
 talk with a ruffian at her chamberwindow
 who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
 confess'd the vile encounters they have had
 a thousand times in secret
don john fie fie they are not to be named my lord
 not to be spoke of
 there is not chastity enough in language
 without offence to utter them thus pretty lady
 i am sorry for thy much misgovernment
claudio o hero what a hero hadst thou been
 if half thy outward graces had been placed
 about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
 but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
 thou pure impiety and impious purity
 for thee i'll lock up all the gates of love
 and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
 to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
 and never shall it more be gracious
leonato hath no man's dagger here a point for me
 hero swoons
beatrice why how now cousin wherefore sink you down
don john come let us go these things come thus to light
 smother her spirits up
 exeunt don pedro don john and claudio
benedick how doth the lady
beatrice dead i think help uncle
 hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar
leonato o fate take not away thy heavy hand
 death is the fairest cover for her shame
 that may be wish'd for
beatrice how now cousin hero
friar francis have comfort lady
leonato dost thou look up
friar francis yea wherefore should she not
leonato wherefore why doth not every earthly thing
 cry shame upon her could she here deny
 the story that is printed in her blood
 do not live hero do not ope thine eyes
 for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die
 thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
 myself would on the rearward of reproaches
 strike at thy life grieved i i had but one
 chid i for that at frugal nature's frame
 o one too much by thee why had i one
 why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
 why had i not with charitable hand
 took up a beggar's issue at my gates
 who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy
 i might have said no part of it is mine
 this shame derives itself from unknown loins'
 but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised
 and mine that i was proud on mine so much
 that i myself was to myself not mine
 valuing of herwhy she o she is fallen
 into a pit of ink that the wide sea
 hath drops too few to wash her clean again
 and salt too little which may season give
 to her foultainted flesh
benedick sir sir be patient
 for my part i am so attired in wonder
 i know not what to say
beatrice o on my soul my cousin is belied
benedick lady were you her bedfellow last night
beatrice no truly not although until last night
 i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
leonato confirm'd confirm'd o that is stronger made
 which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron
 would the two princes lie and claudio lie
 who loved her so that speaking of her foulness
 wash'd it with tears hence from her let her die
friar francis hear me a little for i have only been
 silent so long and given way unto
 this course of fortune 
 by noting of the lady i have mark'd
 a thousand blushing apparitions
 to start into her face a thousand innocent shames
 in angel whiteness beat away those blushes
 and in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
 to burn the errors that these princes hold
 against her maiden truth call me a fool
 trust not my reading nor my observations
 which with experimental seal doth warrant
 the tenor of my book trust not my age
 my reverence calling nor divinity
 if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
 under some biting error
leonato friar it cannot be
 thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
 is that she will not add to her damnation
 a sin of perjury she not denies it
 why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
 that which appears in proper nakedness
friar francis lady what man is he you are accused of
hero they know that do accuse me i know none
 if i know more of any man alive
 than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
 let all my sins lack mercy o my father
 prove you that any man with me conversed
 at hours unmeet or that i yesternight
 maintain'd the change of words with any creature
 refuse me hate me torture me to death
friar francis there is some strange misprision in the princes
benedick two of them have the very bent of honour
 and if their wisdoms be misled in this
 the practise of it lives in john the bastard
 whose spirits toil in frame of villanies
leonato i know not if they speak but truth of her
 these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour
 the proudest of them shall well hear of it
 time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
 nor age so eat up my invention
 nor fortune made such havoc of my means
 nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
 but they shall find awaked in such a kind
 both strength of limb and policy of mind
 ability in means and choice of friends
 to quit me of them throughly
friar francis pause awhile
 and let my counsel sway you in this case
 your daughter here the princes left for dead
 let her awhile be secretly kept in
 and publish it that she is dead indeed
 maintain a mourning ostentation
 and on your family's old monument
 hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
 that appertain unto a burial
leonato what shall become of this what will this do
friar francis marry this well carried shall on her behalf
 change slander to remorse that is some good
 but not for that dream i on this strange course
 but on this travail look for greater birth
 she dying as it must so be maintain'd
 upon the instant that she was accused
 shall be lamented pitied and excused
 of every hearer for it so falls out
 that what we have we prize not to the worth
 whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost
 why then we rack the value then we find
 the virtue that possession would not show us
 whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio
 when he shall hear she died upon his words
 the idea of her life shall sweetly creep
 into his study of imagination
 and every lovely organ of her life
 shall come apparell'd in more precious habit
 more movingdelicate and full of life
 into the eye and prospect of his soul
 than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn
 if ever love had interest in his liver
 and wish he had not so accused her
 no though he thought his accusation true
 let this be so and doubt not but success
 will fashion the event in better shape
 than i can lay it down in likelihood
 but if all aim but this be levell'd false
 the supposition of the lady's death
 will quench the wonder of her infamy
 and if it sort not well you may conceal her
 as best befits her wounded reputation
 in some reclusive and religious life
 out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
benedick signior leonato let the friar advise you
 and though you know my inwardness and love
 is very much unto the prince and claudio
 yet by mine honour i will deal in this
 as secretly and justly as your soul
 should with your body
leonato being that i flow in grief
 the smallest twine may lead me
friar francis tis well consented presently away
 for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
 come lady die to live this weddingday
 perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure
 exeunt all but benedick and beatrice
benedick lady beatrice have you wept all this while
beatrice yea and i will weep a while longer
benedick i will not desire that
beatrice you have no reason i do it freely
benedick surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged
beatrice ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her
benedick is there any way to show such friendship
beatrice a very even way but no such friend
benedick may a man do it
beatrice it is a man's office but not yours
benedick i do love nothing in the world so well as you is
 not that strange
beatrice as strange as the thing i know not it were as
 possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as
 you but believe me not and yet i lie not i
 confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin
benedick by my sword beatrice thou lovest me
beatrice do not swear and eat it
benedick i will swear by it that you love me and i will make
 him eat it that says i love not you
beatrice will you not eat your word
benedick with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest
 i love thee
beatrice why then god forgive me
benedick what offence sweet beatrice
beatrice you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to
 protest i loved you
benedick and do it with all thy heart
beatrice i love you with so much of my heart that none is
 left to protest
benedick come bid me do any thing for thee
beatrice kill claudio
benedick ha not for the wide world
beatrice you kill me to deny it farewell
benedick tarry sweet beatrice
beatrice i am gone though i am here there is no love in
 you nay i pray you let me go
benedick beatrice
beatrice in faith i will go
benedick we'll be friends first
beatrice you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy
benedick is claudio thine enemy
beatrice is he not approved in the height a villain that
 hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o
 that i were a man what bear her in hand until they
 come to take hands and then with public
 accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour
 o god that i were a man i would eat his heart
 in the marketplace
benedick hear me beatrice
beatrice talk with a man out at a window a proper saying
benedick nay but beatrice
beatrice sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone
benedick beat
beatrice princes and counties surely a princely testimony
 a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant
 surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i
 had any friend would be a man for my sake but
 manhood is melted into courtesies valour into
 compliment and men are only turned into tongue and
 trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules
 that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a
 man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving
benedick tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee
beatrice use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
benedick think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero
beatrice yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul
benedick enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will
 kiss your hand and so i leave you by this hand
 claudio shall render me a dear account as you
 hear of me so think of me go comfort your
 cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell

 rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that hath

 thing handsome about him bring him away o that

 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act v
scene i before leonato's house
 enter leonato and antonio
antonio if you go on thus you will kill yourself
 and tis not wisdom thus to second grief
 against yourself
leonato i pray thee cease thy counsel
 which falls into mine ears as profitless
 as water in a sieve give not me counsel
 nor let no comforter delight mine ear
 but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
 bring me a father that so loved his child
 whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine
 and bid him speak of patience
 measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
 and let it answer every strain for strain
 as thus for thus and such a grief for such
 in every lineament branch shape and form
 if such a one will smile and stroke his beard
 bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan
 patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
 with candlewasters bring him yet to me
 and i of him will gather patience
 but there is no such man for brother men
 can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
 which they themselves not feel but tasting it
 their counsel turns to passion which before
 would give preceptial medicine to rage
 fetter strong madness in a silken thread
 charm ache with air and agony with words
 no no tis all men's office to speak patience
 to those that wring under the load of sorrow
 but no man's virtue nor sufficiency
 to be so moral when he shall endure
 the like himself therefore give me no counsel
 my griefs cry louder than advertisement
antonio therein do men from children nothing differ
leonato i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood
 for there was never yet philosopher
 that could endure the toothache patiently
 however they have writ the style of gods
 and made a push at chance and sufferance
antonio yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
 make those that do offend you suffer too
leonato there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so
 my soul doth tell me hero is belied
 and that shall claudio know so shall the prince
 and all of them that thus dishonour her
antonio here comes the prince and claudio hastily
 enter don pedro and claudio

leonato marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
 nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword

claudio marry beshrew my hand
 if it should give your age such cause of fear
 in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
leonato tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
 i speak not like a dotard nor a fool
 as under privilege of age to brag
 what i have done being young or what would do
 were i not old know claudio to thy head
 thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
 that i am forced to lay my reverence by
 and with grey hairs and bruise of many days
 do challenge thee to trial of a man
 i say thou hast belied mine innocent child
 thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
 and she lies buried with her ancestors
 o in a tomb where never scandal slept
 save this of hers framed by thy villany
claudio my villany
leonato thine claudio thine i say

 as i dare take a serpent by the tongue
 boys apes braggarts jacks milksops
leonato brother antony
antonio hold you content what man i know them yea
 and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
 scrambling outfacing fashionmonging boys
 that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
 go anticly show outward hideousness
 and speak off half a dozen dangerous words
 how they might hurt their enemies if they durst
 and this is all
leonato but brother antony
antonio come tis no matter
 do not you meddle let me deal in this
don pedro gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
 my heart is sorry for your daughter's death
 but on my honour she was charged with nothing

 highproof melancholy and would fain have it beaten

claudio god bless me from a challenge
benedick aside to claudio you are a villain i jest not

 head and a capon the which if i do not carve most

 a woodcock too
benedick sir your wit ambles well it goes easily
don pedro i'll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the
 other day i said thou hadst a fine wit true'
 said she a fine little one no said i a
 great wit right says she a great gross one'
 nay said i a good wit just said she it
 hurts nobody nay said i the gentleman
 is wise certain said she a wise gentleman'
 nay said i he hath the tongues that i
 believe said she for he swore a thing to me on
 monday night which he forswore on tuesday morning
 there's a double tongue there's two tongues thus
 did she an hour together transshape thy particular
 virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou
 wast the properest man in italy
claudio for the which she wept heartily and said she cared
 not
don pedro yea that she did but yet for all that an if she
 did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly
 the old man's daughter told us all
claudio all all and moreover god saw him when he was
 hid in the garden
don pedro but when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
 the sensible benedick's head
claudio yea and text underneath here dwells benedick the
 married man'
benedick fare you well boy you know my mind i will leave

 exit
don pedro he is in earnest
claudio in most profound earnest and i'll warrant you for
 the love of beatrice
don pedro and hath challenged thee

 doublet and hose and leaves off his wit
claudio he is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a
 doctor to such a man
don pedro but soft you let me be pluck up my heart and
 be sad did he not say my brother was fled
 enter dogberry verges and the watch with conrade

don pedro officers what offence have these men done
dogberry marry sir they have committed false report
 moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily

 belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust
 things and to conclude they are lying knaves
don pedro first i ask thee what they have done thirdly i
 ask thee what's their offence sixth and lastly why
 they are committed and to conclude what you lay
 to their charge
claudio rightly reasoned and in his own division and by
 my troth there's one meaning well suited
don pedro who have you offended masters that you are thus
 bound to your answer this learned constable is
 too cunning to be understood what's your offence
borachio sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer
 do you hear me and let this count kill me i have
 deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms
 could not discover these shallow fools have brought
 to light who in the night overheard me confessing
 to this man how don john your brother incensed me
 to slander the lady hero how you were brought into
 the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero's
 garments how you disgraced her when you should
 marry her my villany they have upon record which
 i had rather seal with my death than repeat over
 to my shame the lady is dead upon mine and my
 master's false accusation and briefly i desire
 nothing but the reward of a villain
don pedro runs not this speech like iron through your blood
claudio i have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it
don pedro but did my brother set thee on to this
borachio yea and paid me richly for the practise of it
don pedro he is composed and framed of treachery
 and fled he is upon this villany
claudio sweet hero now thy image doth appear

 but always hath been just and virtuous
 in any thing that i do know by her
dogberry moreover sir which indeed is not under white and
 black this plaintiff here the offender did call

 punishment and also the watch heard them talk of

benedick pray thee sweet mistress margaret deserve well at
 my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice
margaret will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty
benedick in so high a style margaret that no man living
 shall come over it for in most comely truth thou
 deservest it
margaret to have no man come over me why shall i always
 keep below stairs
benedick thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth it catches
margaret and yours as blunt as the fencer's foils which hit
 but hurt not
benedick a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a
 woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give
 thee the bucklers
margaret give us the swords we have bucklers of our own
benedick if you use them margaret you must put in the
 pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids
margaret well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legs
benedick and therefore will come
 exit margaret
 sings
 the god of love
 that sits above
 and knows me and knows me
 how pitiful i deserve
 i mean in singing but in loving leander the good
 swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and
 a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmangers
 whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
 blank verse why they were never so truly turned
 over and over as my poor self in love marry i
 cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find
 out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent
 rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for
 school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous
 endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet
 nor i cannot woo in festival terms
 enter beatrice
 sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee
beatrice yea signior and depart when you bid me
benedick o stay but till then
beatrice then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere
 i go let me go with that i came which is with
 knowing what hath passed between you and claudio
benedick only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee
beatrice foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but
 foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i
 will depart unkissed
benedick thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense
 so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee
 plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either
 i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe
 him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for
 which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
beatrice for them all together which maintained so politic
 a state of evil that they will not admit any good
 part to intermingle with them but for which of my
 good parts did you first suffer love for me
benedick suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love
 indeed for i love thee against my will
beatrice in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart
 if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for
 yours for i will never love that which my friend hates
benedick thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably
beatrice it appears not in this confession there's not one
 wise man among twenty that will praise himself
benedick an old an old instance beatrice that lived in
 the lime of good neighbours if a man do not erect
 in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live
 no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
 widow weeps
beatrice and how long is that think you
benedick question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in
 rheum therefore is it most expedient for the
 wise if don worm his conscience find no
 impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his
 own virtues as i am to myself so much for
 praising myself who i myself will bear witness is
 praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin
beatrice very ill
benedick and how do you
beatrice very ill too
benedick serve god love me and mend there will i leave
 you too for here comes one in haste
 enter ursula

benedick and i do with an eye of love requite her
leonato the sight whereof i think you had from me
 from claudio and the prince but what's your will
benedick your answer sir is enigmatical
 but for my will my will is your good will

 in the state of honourable marriage
 in which good friar i shall desire your help
leonato my heart is with your liking

 three others

leonato call her forth brother here's the friar ready

don pedro good morrow benedick why what's the matter
 that you have such a february face
 so full of frost of storm and cloudiness
claudio i think he thinks upon the savage bull
 tush fear not man we'll tip thy horns with gold
 and all europa shall rejoice at thee
 as once europa did at lusty jove
 when he would play the noble beast in love
benedick bull jove sir had an amiable low

 and got a calf in that same noble feat
 much like to you for you have just his bleat

 reenter antonio with the ladies masked
 which is the lady i must seize upon
antonio this same is she and i do give you her
claudio why then she's mine sweet let me see your face
leonato no that you shall not till you take her hand
 before this friar and swear to marry her
claudio give me your hand before this holy friar
 i am your husband if you like of me
hero and when i lived i was your other wife
 unmasking
 and when you loved you were my other husband
claudio another hero
hero nothing certainer
 one hero died defiled but i do live
 and surely as i live i am a maid
don pedro the former hero hero that is dead
leonato she died my lord but whiles her slander lived
friar francis all this amazement can i qualify
 when after that the holy rites are ended
 i'll tell you largely of fair hero's death
 meantime let wonder seem familiar
 and to the chapel let us presently
benedick soft and fair friar which is beatrice
beatrice unmasking i answer to that name what is your will
benedick do not you love me
beatrice why no no more than reason
benedick why then your uncle and the prince and claudio
 have been deceived they swore you did
beatrice do not you love me
benedick troth no no more than reason
beatrice why then my cousin margaret and ursula
 are much deceived for they did swear you did
benedick they swore that you were almost sick for me
beatrice they swore that you were wellnigh dead for me
benedick tis no such matter then you do not love me
beatrice no truly but in friendly recompense
leonato come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman
claudio and i'll be sworn upon't that he loves her
 for here's a paper written in his hand
 a halting sonnet of his own pure brain
 fashion'd to beatrice
hero and here's another
 writ in my cousin's hand stolen from her pocket
 containing her affection unto benedick
benedick a miracle here's our own hands against our hearts
 come i will have thee but by this light i take
 thee for pity
beatrice i would not deny you but by this good day i yield
 upon great persuasion and partly to save your life
 for i was told you were in a consumption
benedick peace i will stop your mouth
 kissing her
don pedro how dost thou benedick the married man
benedick i'll tell thee what prince a college of
 witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour dost
 thou think i care for a satire or an epigram no
 if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear
 nothing handsome about him in brief since i do
 purpose to marry i will think nothing to any
 purpose that the world can say against it and
 therefore never flout at me for what i have said
 against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my
 conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to
 have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my
 kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin
claudio i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice
 that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
 life to make thee a doubledealer which out of
 question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look
 exceedingly narrowly to thee
benedick come come we are friends let's have a dance ere
 we are married that we may lighten our own hearts
 and our wives heels
leonato we'll have dancing afterward
benedick first of my word therefore play music prince
 thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife
 there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord your brother john is ta'en in flight
 and brought with armed men back to messina
benedick think not on him till tomorrow
 i'll devise thee brave punishments for him
 strike up pipers

scene dispersedly in various countries
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
 enter gower
 before the palace of antioch
 to sing a song that old was sung
 from ashes ancient gower is come
 assuming man's infirmities
 to glad your ear and please your eyes
 it hath been sung at festivals
 on embereves and holyales
 and lords and ladies in their lives
 have read it for restoratives
 the purchase is to make men glorious
 et bonum quo antiquius eo melius
 if you born in these latter times
 when wit's more ripe accept my rhymes
 and that to hear an old man sing
 may to your wishes pleasure bring
 i life would wish and that i might
 waste it for you like taperlight
 this antioch then antiochus the great
 built up this city for his chiefest seat
 the fairest in all syria
 i tell you what mine authors say
 this king unto him took a fere
 who died and left a female heir
 so buxom blithe and full of face
 as heaven had lent her all his grace
 with whom the father liking took
 and her to incest did provoke
 bad child worse father to entice his own
 to evil should be done by none
 but custom what they did begin
 was with long use account no sin
 the beauty of this sinful dame
 made many princes thither frame
 to seek her as a bedfellow
 in marriagepleasures playfellow
 which to prevent he made a law
 to keep her still and men in awe
 that whoso ask'd her for his wife
 his riddle told not lost his life
 so for her many a wight did die
 as yon grim looks do testify
 what now ensues to the judgment of your eye
 i give my cause who best can justify
 exit
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene i antioch a room in the palace
 enter antiochus prince pericles and followers
antiochus young prince of tyre you have at large received
 the danger of the task you undertake
pericles i have antiochus and with a soul
 embolden'd with the glory of her praise
 think death no hazard in this enterprise
antiochus bring in our daughter clothed like a bride
 for the embracements even of jove himself
 at whose conception till lucina reign'd
 nature this dowry gave to glad her presence
 the senatehouse of planets all did sit
 to knit in her their best perfections
 music enter the daughter of antiochus
pericles see where she comes apparell'd like the spring
 graces her subjects and her thoughts the king
 of every virtue gives renown to men
 her face the book of praises where is read
 nothing but curious pleasures as from thence
 sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
 could never be her mild companion
 you gods that made me man and sway in love
 that have inflamed desire in my breast
 to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree
 or die in the adventure be my helps
 as i am son and servant to your will
 to compass such a boundless happiness
antiochus prince pericles
pericles that would be son to great antiochus
antiochus before thee stands this fair hesperides
 with golden fruit but dangerous to be touch'd
 for deathlike dragons here affright thee hard
 her face like heaven enticeth thee to view
 her countless glory which desert must gain
 and which without desert because thine eye
 presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die
 yon sometimes famous princes like thyself
 drawn by report adventurous by desire
 tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale
 that without covering save yon field of stars
 here they stand martyrs slain in cupid's wars
 and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
 for going on death's net whom none resist
pericles antiochus i thank thee who hath taught
 my frail mortality to know itself
 and by those fearful objects to prepare
 this body like to them to what i must
 for death remember'd should be like a mirror
 who tells us life's but breath to trust it error
 i'll make my will then and as sick men do
 who know the world see heaven but feeling woe
 gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did
 so i bequeath a happy peace to you
 and all good men as every prince should do
 my riches to the earth from whence they came
 but my unspotted fire of love to you
 to the daughter of antiochus
 thus ready for the way of life or death
 i wait the sharpest blow antiochus
antiochus scorning advice read the conclusion then
 which read and not expounded tis decreed
 as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed
daughter of all say'd yet mayst thou prove prosperous
 of all say'd yet i wish thee happiness
pericles like a bold champion i assume the lists
 nor ask advice of any other thought
 but faithfulness and courage
 he reads the riddle
 i am no viper yet i feed
 on mother's flesh which did me breed
 i sought a husband in which labour
 i found that kindness in a father
 he's father son and husband mild
 i mother wife and yet his child
 how they may be and yet in two
 as you will live resolve it you
 sharp physic is the last but o you powers
 that give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts
 why cloud they not their sights perpetually
 if this be true which makes me pale to read it
 fair glass of light i loved you and could still
 takes hold of the hand of the daughter of antiochus
 were not this glorious casket stored with ill
 but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt
 for he's no man on whom perfections wait
 that knowing sin within will touch the gate
 you are a fair viol and your sense the strings
 who finger'd to make man his lawful music
 would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken
 but being play'd upon before your time
 hell only danceth at so harsh a chime
 good sooth i care not for you
antiochus prince pericles touch not upon thy life
 for that's an article within our law
 as dangerous as the rest your time's expired
 either expound now or receive your sentence
pericles great king
 few love to hear the sins they love to act
 twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it
 who has a book of all that monarchs do
 he's more secure to keep it shut than shown
 for vice repeated is like the wandering wind
 blows dust in other's eyes to spread itself
 and yet the end of all is bought thus dear
 the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear
 to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts
 copp'd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throng'd
 by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for't
 kings are earth's gods in vice their law's
 their will
 and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill
 it is enough you know and it is fit
 what being more known grows worse to smother it
 all love the womb that their first being bred
 then give my tongue like leave to love my head
antiochus aside heaven that i had thy head he has found
 the meaning
 but i will gloze with himyoung prince of tyre
 though by the tenor of our strict edict
 your exposition misinterpreting
 we might proceed to cancel of your days
 yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree
 as your fair self doth tune us otherwise
 forty days longer we do respite you
 if by which time our secret be undone
 this mercy shows we'll joy in such a son
 and until then your entertain shall be
 as doth befit our honour and your worth
 exeunt all but pericles
pericles how courtesy would seem to cover sin
 when what is done is like an hypocrite
 the which is good in nothing but in sight
 if it be true that i interpret false
 then were it certain you were not so bad
 as with foul incest to abuse your soul
 where now you're both a father and a son
 by your untimely claspings with your child
 which pleasure fits an husband not a father
 and she an eater of her mother's flesh
 by the defiling of her parent's bed
 and both like serpents are who though they feed
 on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed
 antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men
 blush not in actions blacker than the night
 will shun no course to keep them from the light
 one sin i know another doth provoke
 murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke
 poison and treason are the hands of sin
 ay and the targets to put off the shame
 then lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear
 by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear
 exit
 reenter antiochus
antiochus he hath found the meaning for which we mean
 to have his head
 he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy
 nor tell the world antiochus doth sin
 in such a loathed manner
 and therefore instantly this prince must die
 for by his fall my honour must keep high
 who attends us there
 enter thaliard
thaliard doth your highness call
antiochus thaliard
 you are of our chamber and our mind partakes
 her private actions to your secrecy
 and for your faithfulness we will advance you
 thaliard behold here's poison and here's gold
 we hate the prince of tyre and thou must kill him
 it fits thee not to ask the reason why
 because we bid it say is it done
thaliard my lord
 tis done
antiochus enough
 enter a messenger
 let your breath cool yourself telling your haste
messenger my lord prince pericles is fled
 exit
antiochus as thou
 wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot
 from a wellexperienced archer hits the mark
 his eye doth level at so thou ne'er return
 unless thou say prince pericles is dead'
thaliard my lord
 if i can get him within my pistol's length
 i'll make him sure enough so farewell to your highness
antiochus thaliard adieu
 exit thaliard

 my heart can lend no succor to my head

 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene ii tyre a room in the palace
 enter pericles
pericles to lords without let none disturb uswhy should
 this change of thoughts
 the sad companion dulleyed melancholy
 be my so used a guest as not an hour
 in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night
 the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet
 here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them
 and danger which i fear'd is at antioch
 whose aim seems far too short to hit me here
 yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits
 nor yet the other's distance comfort me
 then it is thus the passions of the mind
 that have their first conception by misdread
 have afternourishment and life by care
 and what was first but fear what might be done
 grows elder now and cares it be not done
 and so with me the great antiochus
 gainst whom i am too little to contend
 since he's so great can make his will his act
 will think me speaking though i swear to silence
 nor boots it me to say i honour him
 if he suspect i may dishonour him
 and what may make him blush in being known
 he'll stop the course by which it might be known
 with hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land
 and with the ostent of war will look so huge
 amazement shall drive courage from the state
 our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist
 and subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence
 which care of them not pity of myself
 who am no more but as the tops of trees
 which fence the roots they grow by and defend them
 makes both my body pine and soul to languish
 and punish that before that he would punish
 enter helicanus with other lords
first lord joy and all comfort in your sacred breast
second lord and keep your mind till you return to us
 peaceful and comfortable
helicanus peace peace and give experience tongue
 they do abuse the king that flatter him
 for flattery is the bellows blows up sin
 the thing which is flatter'd but a spark
 to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing
 whereas reproof obedient and in order
 fits kings as they are men for they may err
 when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace
 he flatters you makes war upon your life
 prince pardon me or strike me if you please
 i cannot be much lower than my knees
pericles all leave us else but let your cares o'erlook
 what shipping and what lading's in our haven
 and then return to us
 exeunt lords
 helicanus thou
 hast moved us what seest thou in our looks
helicanus an angry brow dread lord
pericles if there be such a dart in princes frowns
 how durst thy tongue move anger to our face
helicanus how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence
 they have their nourishment
pericles thou know'st i have power
 to take thy life from thee
helicanus kneeling
 i have ground the axe myself
 do you but strike the blow
pericles rise prithee rise
 sit down thou art no flatterer
 i thank thee for it and heaven forbid
 that kings should let their ears hear their
 faults hid
 fit counsellor and servant for a prince
 who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant
 what wouldst thou have me do
helicanus to bear with patience
 such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself
pericles thou speak'st like a physician helicanus
 that minister'st a potion unto me
 that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself
 attend me then i went to antioch
 where as thou know'st against the face of death
 i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
 from whence an issue i might propagate
 are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects
 her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder
 the resthark in thine earas black as incest
 which by my knowledge found the sinful father
 seem'd not to strike but smooth but thou
 know'st this
 tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss
 such fear so grew in me i hither fled
 under the covering of a careful night
 who seem'd my good protector and being here
 bethought me what was past what might succeed
 i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears
 decrease not but grow faster than the years
 and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth
 that i should open to the listening air
 how many worthy princes bloods were shed
 to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope
 to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms
 and make pretence of wrong that i have done him
 when all for mine if i may call offence
 must feel war's blow who spares not innocence
 which love to all of which thyself art one
 who now reprovest me for it
helicanus alas sir
pericles drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks
 musings into my mind with thousand doubts
 how i might stop this tempest ere it came
 and finding little comfort to relieve them
 i thought it princely charity to grieve them
helicanus well my lord since you have given me leave to speak
 freely will i speak antiochus you fear
 and justly too i think you fear the tyrant
 who either by public war or private treason
 will take away your life
 therefore my lord go travel for a while
 till that his rage and anger be forgot
 or till the destinies do cut his thread of life
 your rule direct to any if to me
 day serves not light more faithful than i'll be
pericles i do not doubt thy faith
 but should he wrong my liberties in my absence
helicanus we'll mingle our bloods together in the earth
 from whence we had our being and our birth
pericles tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus
 intend my travel where i'll hear from thee
 and by whose letters i'll dispose myself
 the care i had and have of subjects good
 on thee i lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it
 i'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath
 who shuns not to break one will sure crack both
 but in our orbs we'll live so round and safe
 that time of both this truth shall ne'er convince
 thou show'dst a subject's shine i a true prince

scene iii tyre an antechamber in the palace
 enter thaliard
thaliard so this is tyre and this the court here must i
 kill king pericles and if i do it not i am sure to
 be hanged at home tis dangerous well i perceive
 he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that
 being bid to ask what he would of the king desired
 he might know none of his secrets now do i see he
 had some reason for't for if a king bid a man be a
 villain he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
 be one hush here come the lords of tyre
 enter helicanus and escanes with other lords of tyre
helicanus you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre
 further to question me of your king's departure
 his seal'd commission left in trust with me
 doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel
thaliard aside how the king gone
helicanus if further yet you will be satisfied
 why as it were unlicensed of your loves
 he would depart i'll give some light unto you
 being at antioch
thaliard aside what from antioch
helicanus royal antiochuson what cause i know not
 took some displeasure at him at least he judged so
 and doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd
 to show his sorrow he'ld correct himself
 so puts himself unto the shipman's toil
 with whom each minute threatens life or death
thaliard aside well i perceive
 i shall not be hang'd now although i would
 but since he's gone the king's seas must please
 he scaped the land to perish at the sea
 i'll present myself peace to the lords of tyre
helicanus lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome
thaliard from him i come
 with message unto princely pericles
 but since my landing i have understood
 your lord has betook himself to unknown travels
 my message must return from whence it came
helicanus we have no reason to desire it
 commended to our master not to us
 yet ere you shall depart this we desire
 as friends to antioch we may feast in tyre

 enter cleon the governor of tarsus with dionyza
 and others
cleon my dionyza shall we rest us here
 and by relating tales of others griefs
 see if twill teach us to forget our own
dionyza that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it
 for who digs hills because they do aspire
 throws down one mountain to cast up a higher
 o my distressed lord even such our griefs are
 here they're but felt and seen with mischief's eyes
 but like to groves being topp'd they higher rise
cleon o dionyza
 who wanteth food and will not say he wants it
 or can conceal his hunger till he famish
 our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
 our woes into the air our eyes do weep
 till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder
 that if heaven slumber while their creatures want
 they may awake their helps to comfort them
 i'll then discourse our woes felt several years
 and wanting breath to speak help me with tears
dionyza i'll do my best sir
cleon this tarsus o'er which i have the government
 a city on whom plenty held full hand
 for riches strew'd herself even in the streets
 whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds
 and strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at
 whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd
 like one another's glass to trim them by
 their tables were stored full to glad the sight
 and not so much to feed on as delight
 all poverty was scorn'd and pride so great
 the name of help grew odious to repeat
dionyza o tis too true
cleon but see what heaven can do by this our change
 these mouths who but of late earth sea and air
 were all too little to content and please
 although they gave their creatures in abundance
 as houses are defiled for want of use
 they are now starved for want of exercise
 those palates who not yet two summers younger
 must have inventions to delight the taste
 would now be glad of bread and beg for it
 those mothers who to nousle up their babes
 thought nought too curious are ready now
 to eat those little darlings whom they loved
 so sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife
 draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life
 here stands a lord and there a lady weeping
 here many sink yet those which see them fall
 have scarce strength left to give them burial
 is not this true
dionyza our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it
cleon o let those cities that of plenty's cup
 and her prosperities so largely taste
 with their superfluous riots hear these tears
 the misery of tarsus may be theirs
 enter a lord
lord where's the lord governor
cleon here
 speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste
 for comfort is too far for us to expect
lord we have descried upon our neighbouring shore
 a portly sail of ships make hitherward
cleon i thought as much
 one sorrow never comes but brings an heir
 that may succeed as his inheritor
 and so in ours some neighbouring nation
 taking advantage of our misery
 hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power
 to beat us down the which are down already
 and make a conquest of unhappy me
 whereas no glory's got to overcome
lord that's the least fear for by the semblance
 of their white flags display'd they bring us peace
 and come to us as favourers not as foes
cleon thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat
 who makes the fairest show means most deceit
 but bring they what they will and what they can
 what need we fear
 the ground's the lowest and we are half way there
 go tell their general we attend him here
 to know for what he comes and whence he comes
 and what he craves
lord i go my lord
 exit
cleon welcome is peace if he on peace consist
 if wars we are unable to resist
 enter pericles with attendants
pericles lord governor for so we hear you are
 let not our ships and number of our men
 be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes
 we have heard your miseries as far as tyre
 and seen the desolation of your streets
 nor come we to add sorrow to your tears
 but to relieve them of their heavy load
 and these our ships you happily may think
 are like the trojan horse was stuff'd within
 with bloody veins expecting overthrow
 are stored with corn to make your needy bread
 and give them life whom hunger starved half dead
all the gods of greece protect you
 and we'll pray for you
pericles arise i pray you rise
 we do not look for reverence but to love
 and harbourage for ourself our ships and men
cleon the which when any shall not gratify
 or pay you with unthankfulness in thought
 be it our wives our children or ourselves
 the curse of heaven and men succeed their evils
 till whenthe which i hope shall ne'er be seen

first fisherman why as men do aland the great ones eat up the
 little ones i can compare our rich misers to
 nothing so fitly as to a whale a plays and
 tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at
 last devours them all at a mouthful such whales
 have i heard on o the land who never leave gaping
 till they've swallowed the whole parish church
 steeple bells and all
pericles aside a pretty moral
third fisherman but master if i had been the sexton i would have
 been that day in the belfry
second fisherman why man
third fisherman because he should have swallowed me too and when i
 had been in his belly i would have kept such a
 jangling of the bells that he should never have
 left till he cast bells steeple church and
 parish up again but if the good king simonides
 were of my mind
pericles aside simonides
third fisherman we would purge the land of these drones that rob
 the bee of her honey
pericles aside how from the finny subject of the sea
 these fishers tell the infirmities of men
 and from their watery empire recollect
 all that may men approve or men detect
 peace be at your labour honest fishermen
second fisherman honest good fellow what's that if it be a day
 fits you search out of the calendar and nobody
 look after it
pericles may see the sea hath cast upon your coast
second fisherman what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
 way
pericles a man whom both the waters and the wind
 in that vast tenniscourt have made the ball
 for them to play upon entreats you pity him
 he asks of you that never used to beg
first fisherman no friend cannot you beg here's them in our
 country greece gets more with begging than we can do
 with working
second fisherman canst thou catch any fishes then
pericles i never practised it
second fisherman nay then thou wilt starve sure for here's nothing
 to be got nowadays unless thou canst fish for't
pericles what i have been i have forgot to know
 but what i am want teaches me to think on
 a man throng'd up with cold my veins are chill
 and have no more of life than may suffice
 to give my tongue that heat to ask your help
 which if you shall refuse when i am dead
 for that i am a man pray see me buried
first fisherman die quotha now gods forbid i have a gown here
 come put it on keep thee warm now afore me a
 handsome fellow come thou shalt go home and
 we'll have flesh for holidays fish for
 fastingdays and moreo'er puddings and flapjacks
 and thou shalt be welcome
pericles i thank you sir
second fisherman hark you my friend you said you could not beg
pericles i did but crave
second fisherman but crave then i'll turn craver too and so i
 shall scape whipping
pericles why are all your beggars whipped then
second fisherman o not all my friend not all for if all your
 beggars were whipped i would wish no better office
 than to be beadle but master i'll go draw up the
 net
 exit with third fisherman
pericles aside how well this honest mirth becomes their labour
first fisherman hark you sir do you know where ye are
pericles not well
first fisherman why i'll tell you this is called pentapolis and
 our king the good simonides
pericles the good king simonides do you call him
first fisherman ay sir and he deserves so to be called for his
 peaceable reign and good government
pericles he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects
 the name of good by his government how far is his
 court distant from this shore
first fisherman marry sir half a day's journey and i'll tell
 you he hath a fair daughter and tomorrow is her
 birthday and there are princes and knights come
 from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love
pericles were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish
 to make one there
first fisherman o sir things must be as they may and what a man
 cannot get he may lawfully deal forhis wife's soul
 reenter second and third fishermen drawing up a net
second fisherman help master help here's a fish hangs in the net
 like a poor man's right in the law twill hardly
 come out ha bots on't tis come at last and
 tis turned to a rusty armour
pericles an armour friends i pray you let me see it
 thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses
 thou givest me somewhat to repair myself
 and though it was mine own part of my heritage
 which my dead father did bequeath to me
 with this strict charge even as he left his life
 keep it my pericles it hath been a shield
 twixt me and death'and pointed to this brace
 for that it saved me keep it in like necessity
 the which the gods protect thee frommay
 defend thee'
 it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it
 till the rough seas that spare not any man
 took it in rage though calm'd have given't again
 i thank thee for't my shipwreck now's no ill
 since i have here my father's gift in's will
first fisherman what mean you sir
pericles to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth
 for it was sometime target to a king
 i know it by this mark he loved me dearly
 and for his sake i wish the having of it
 and that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court
 where with it i may appear a gentleman
 and if that ever my low fortune's better
 i'll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor
first fisherman why wilt thou tourney for the lady
pericles i'll show the virtue i have borne in arms
first fisherman why do e take it and the gods give thee good on't
second fisherman ay but hark you my friend twas we that made up
 this garment through the rough seams of the waters
 there are certain condolements certain vails i
 hope sir if you thrive you'll remember from
 whence you had it
pericles believe t i will
 by your furtherance i am clothed in steel
 and spite of all the rapture of the sea
 this jewel holds his building on my arm
 unto thy value i will mount myself
 upon a courser whose delightful steps
 shall make the gazer joy to see him tread
 only my friend i yet am unprovided
 of a pair of bases
second fisherman we'll sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to
 make thee a pair and i'll bring thee to the court myself
pericles then honour be but a goal to my will
 this day i'll rise or else add ill to ill

 reception of king princess lords &c
 enter simonides thaisa lords and attendants
simonides are the knights ready to begin the triumph
first lord they are my liege
 and stay your coming to present themselves
simonides return them we are ready and our daughter
 in honour of whose birth these triumphs are
 sits here like beauty's child whom nature gat
 for men to see and seeing wonder at
 exit a lord
thaisa it pleaseth you my royal father to express
 my commendations great whose merit's less
simonides it's fit it should be so for princes are
 a model which heaven makes like to itself
 as jewels lose their glory if neglected
 so princes their renowns if not respected
 tis now your honour daughter to explain
 the labour of each knight in his device
thaisa which to preserve mine honour i'll perform
 enter a knight he passes over and his squire
 presents his shield to the princess
simonides who is the first that doth prefer himself
thaisa a knight of sparta my renowned father
 and the device he bears upon his shield
 is a black ethiope reaching at the sun
 the word lux tua vita mihi'
simonides he loves you well that holds his life of you
 the second knight passes over
 who is the second that presents himself
thaisa a prince of macedon my royal father
 and the device he bears upon his shield
 is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady
 the motto thus in spanish piu por dulzura que por fuerza'
 the third knight passes over
simonides and what's the third
thaisa the third of antioch
 and his device a wreath of chivalry
 the word me pompae provexit apex'
 the fourth knight passes over
simonides what is the fourth
thaisa a burning torch that's turned upside down
 the word quod me alit me extinguit'
simonides which shows that beauty hath his power and will
 which can as well inflame as it can kill
 the fifth knight passes over
thaisa the fifth an hand environed with clouds
 holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried
 the motto thus sic spectanda fides'
 the sixth knight pericles passes over
simonides and what's
 the sixth and last the which the knight himself
 with such a graceful courtesy deliver'd
thaisa he seems to be a stranger but his present is
 a wither'd branch that's only green at top
 the motto in hac spe vivo'
simonides a pretty moral
 from the dejected state wherein he is
 he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish
first lord he had need mean better than his outward show
 can any way speak in his just commend
 for by his rusty outside he appears
 to have practised more the whipstock than the lance
second lord he well may be a stranger for he comes
 to an honour'd triumph strangely furnished
third lord and on set purpose let his armour rust
 until this day to scour it in the dust
simonides opinion's but a fool that makes us scan
 the outward habit by the inward man
 but stay the knights are coming we will withdraw
 into the gallery

 knights from tilting
simonides knights
 to say you're welcome were superfluous
 to place upon the volume of your deeds
 as in a titlepage your worth in arms
 were more than you expect or more than's fit
 since every worth in show commends itself
 prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast
 you are princes and my guests
thaisa but you my knight and guest
 to whom this wreath of victory i give
 and crown you king of this day's happiness
pericles tis more by fortune lady than by merit
simonides call it by what you will the day is yours
 and here i hope is none that envies it
 in framing an artist art hath thus decreed
 to make some good but others to exceed
 and you are her labour'd scholar come queen o'
 the feast
 for daughter so you arehere take your place
 marshal the rest as they deserve their grace
knights we are honour'd much by good simonides
simonides your presence glads our days honour we love
 for who hates honour hates the gods above
marshal sir yonder is your place
pericles some other is more fit
first knight contend not sir for we are gentlemen
 that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
 envy the great nor do the low despise
pericles you are right courteous knights
simonides sit sir sit
pericles by jove i wonder that is king of thoughts
 these cates resist me she but thought upon
thaisa by juno that is queen of marriage
 all viands that i eat do seem unsavoury
 wishing him my meat sure he's a gallant gentleman
simonides he's but a country gentleman
 has done no more than other knights have done
 has broken a staff or so so let it pass
thaisa to me he seems like diamond to glass
pericles yon king's to me like to my father's picture
 which tells me in that glory once he was
 had princes sit like stars about his throne
 and he the sun for them to reverence
 none that beheld him but like lesser lights
 did vail their crowns to his supremacy
 where now his son's like a glowworm in the night
 the which hath fire in darkness none in light
 whereby i see that time's the king of men
 he's both their parent and he is their grave
 and gives them what he will not what they crave
simonides what are you merry knights
knights who can be other in this royal presence
simonides here with a cup that's stored unto the brim
 as you do love fill to your mistress lips
 we drink this health to you
knights we thank your grace
simonides yet pause awhile
 yon knight doth sit too melancholy
 as if the entertainment in our court
 had not a show might countervail his worth
 note it not you thaisa
thaisa what is it
 to me my father
simonides o attend my daughter
 princes in this should live like gods above
 who freely give to every one that comes
 to honour them
 and princes not doing so are like to gnats
 which make a sound but kill'd are wonder'd at
 therefore to make his entrance more sweet
 here say we drink this standingbowl of wine to him
thaisa alas my father it befits not me
 unto a stranger knight to be so bold
 he may my proffer take for an offence
 since men take women's gifts for impudence
simonides how
 do as i bid you or you'll move me else
thaisa aside now by the gods he could not please me better
simonides and furthermore tell him we desire to know of him
 of whence he is his name and parentage
thaisa the king my father sir has drunk to you
pericles i thank him
thaisa wishing it so much blood unto your life
pericles i thank both him and you and pledge him freely
thaisa and further he desires to know of you
 of whence you are your name and parentage
pericles a gentleman of tyre my name pericles
 my education been in arts and arms
 who looking for adventures in the world
 was by the rough seas reft of ships and men
 and after shipwreck driven upon this shore
thaisa he thanks your grace names himself pericles
 a gentleman of tyre
 who only by misfortune of the seas
 bereft of ships and men cast on this shore
simonides now by the gods i pity his misfortune
 and will awake him from his melancholy
 come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles
 and waste the time which looks for other revels
 even in your armours as you are address'd
 will very well become a soldier's dance
 i will not have excuse with saying this
 loud music is too harsh for ladies heads
 since they love men in arms as well as beds
 the knights dance
 so this was well ask'd'twas so well perform'd
 come sir
 here is a lady that wants breathing too
 and i have heard you knights of tyre
 are excellent in making ladies trip
 and that their measures are as excellent
pericles in those that practise them they are my lord
simonides o that's as much as you would be denied
 of your fair courtesy
 the knights and ladies dance
 unclasp unclasp
 thanks gentlemen to all all have done well
 to pericles
 but you the best pages and lights to conduct
 these knights unto their several lodgings
 to pericles
 yours sir
 we have given order to be next our own
pericles i am at your grace's pleasure
simonides princes it is too late to talk of love
 and that's the mark i know you level at
 therefore each one betake him to his rest
 tomorrow all for speeding do their best

 due to this heinous capital offence

 when he was seated in a chariot
 of an inestimable value and his daughter with him
 a fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
 their bodies even to loathing for they so stunk
 that all those eyes adored them ere their fall
 scorn now their hand should give them burial
escanes twas very strange
helicanus and yet but justice for though
 this king were great his greatness was no guard
 to bar heaven's shaft but sin had his reward
escanes tis very true
 enter two or three lords
first lord see not a man in private conference
 or council has respect with him but he
second lord it shall no longer grieve without reproof
third lord and cursed be he that will not second it

first lord know that our griefs are risen to the top
 and now at length they overflow their banks
helicanus your griefs for what wrong not your prince you love
first lord wrong not yourself then noble helicane
 but if the prince do live let us salute him
 or know what ground's made happy by his breath
 if in the world he live we'll seek him out
 if in his grave he rest we'll find him there
 and be resolved he lives to govern us
 or dead give's cause to mourn his funeral
 and leave us to our free election
second lord whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure
 and knowing this kingdom is without a head
 like goodly buildings left without a roof
 soon fall to ruinyour noble self
 that best know how to rule and how to reign
 we thus submit untoour sovereign
all live noble helicane
helicanus for honour's cause forbear your suffrages
 if that you love prince pericles forbear
 take i your wish i leap into the seas
 where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease
 a twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to
 forbear the absence of your king
 if in which time expired he not return
 i shall with aged patience bear your yoke
 but if i cannot win you to this love
 go search like nobles like noble subjects
 and in your search spend your adventurous worth
 whom if you find and win unto return
 you shall like diamonds sit about his crown
first lord to wisdom he's a fool that will not yield
 and since lord helicane enjoineth us
 we with our travels will endeavour us
helicanus then you love us we you and we'll clasp hands
 when peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands

pericles all fortune to the good simonides
simonides to you as much sir i am beholding to you
 for your sweet music this last night i do
 protest my ears were never better fed
 with such delightful pleasing harmony
pericles it is your grace's pleasure to commend
 not my desert
simonides sir you are music's master
pericles the worst of all her scholars my good lord
simonides let me ask you one thing
 what do you think of my daughter sir
pericles a most virtuous princess
simonides and she is fair too is she not
pericles as a fair day in summer wondrous fair
simonides sir my daughter thinks very well of you
 ay so well that you must be her master
 and she will be your scholar therefore look to it
pericles i am unworthy for her schoolmaster
simonides she thinks not so peruse this writing else
pericles aside what's here
 a letter that she loves the knight of tyre
 tis the king's subtlety to have my life
 o seek not to entrap me gracious lord
 a stranger and distressed gentleman
 that never aim'd so high to love your daughter
 but bent all offices to honour her
simonides thou hast bewitch'd my daughter and thou art
 a villain
pericles by the gods i have not
 never did thought of mine levy offence
 nor never did my actions yet commence
 a deed might gain her love or your displeasure
simonides traitor thou liest
pericles traitor
simonides ay traitor
pericles even in his throatunless it be the king
 that calls me traitor i return the lie
simonides aside now by the gods i do applaud his courage
pericles my actions are as noble as my thoughts
 that never relish'd of a base descent
 i came unto your court for honour's cause
 and not to be a rebel to her state
 and he that otherwise accounts of me
 this sword shall prove he's honour's enemy
simonides no
 here comes my daughter she can witness it
 enter thaisa
pericles then as you are as virtuous as fair
 resolve your angry father if my tongue
 did ere solicit or my hand subscribe
 to any syllable that made love to you
thaisa why sir say if you had
 who takes offence at that would make me glad
simonides yea mistress are you so peremptory
 aside
 i am glad on't with all my heart
 i'll tame you i'll bring you in subjection
 will you not having my consent
 bestow your love and your affections
 upon a stranger
 aside
 who for aught i know
 may be nor can i think the contrary
 as great in blood as i myself
 therefore hear you mistress either frame
 your will to mineand you sir hear you
 either be ruled by me or i will make you
 man and wife
 nay come your hands and lips must seal it too
 and being join'd i'll thus your hopes destroy
 and for a further griefgod give you joy
 what are you both pleased
thaisa yes if you love me sir
pericles even as my life or blood that fosters it
simonides what are you both agreed
both yes if it please your majesty

 forgot thee utterly nor have i time
 to give thee hallow'd to thy grave but straight

cerimon gentlemen
 why do you stir so early
first gentleman sir
 our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea
 shook as the earth did quake
 the very principals did seem to rend
 and allto topple pure surprise and fear
 made me to quit the house
second gentleman that is the cause we trouble you so early
 tis not our husbandry
cerimon o you say well
first gentleman but i much marvel that your lordship having
 rich tire about you should at these early hours
 shake off the golden slumber of repose
 tis most strange
 nature should be so conversant with pain
 being thereto not compell'd
cerimon i hold it ever
 virtue and cunning were endowments greater
 than nobleness and riches careless heirs
 may the two latter darken and expend
 but immortality attends the former
 making a man a god tis known i ever
 have studied physic through which secret art
 by turning o'er authorities i have
 together with my practise made familiar
 to me and to my aid the blest infusions
 that dwell in vegetives in metals stones
 and i can speak of the disturbances
 that nature works and of her cures which doth give me
 a more content in course of true delight
 than to be thirsty after tottering honour
 or tie my treasure up in silken bags
 to please the fool and death
second gentleman your honour has through ephesus pour'd forth
 your charity and hundreds call themselves
 your creatures who by you have been restored
 and not your knowledge your personal pain but even
 your purse still open hath built lord cerimon
 such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay

 did the sea toss upon our shore this chest
 tis of some wreck

second gentleman tis like a coffin sir
cerimon whate'er it be
 tis wondrous heavy wrench it open straight
 if the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold
 tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us
second gentleman tis so my lord
cerimon how close tis caulk'd and bitumed
 did the sea cast it up
first servant i never saw so huge a billow sir
 as toss'd it upon shore
cerimon wrench it open
 soft it smells most sweetly in my sense
second gentleman a delicate odour
cerimon as ever hit my nostril so up with it
 o you most potent gods what's here a corse
first gentleman most strange
cerimon shrouded in cloth of state balm'd and entreasured
 with full bags of spices a passport too
 apollo perfect me in the characters
 reads from a scroll
 here i give to understand
 if e'er this coffin drive aland
 i king pericles have lost
 this queen worth all our mundane cost
 who finds her give her burying
 she was the daughter of a king
 besides this treasure for a fee
 the gods requite his charity'
 if thou livest pericles thou hast a heart
 that even cracks for woe this chanced tonight
second gentleman most likely sir
cerimon nay certainly tonight
 for look how fresh she looks they were too rough
 that threw her in the sea make a fire within
 fetch hither all my boxes in my closet

 for she was born at sea i have named so here
 i charge your charity withal leaving her
 the infant of your care beseeching you
 to give her princely training that she may be
 manner'd as she is born
cleon fear not my lord but think
 your grace that fed my country with your corn
 for which the people's prayers still fall upon you
 must in your child be thought on if neglection
 should therein make me vile the common body
 by you relieved would force me to my duty
 but if to that my nature need a spur
 the gods revenge it upon me and mine
 to the end of generation
pericles i believe you
 your honour and your goodness teach me to't
 without your vows till she be married madam

 who shall not be more dear to my respect
 than yours my lord
pericles madam my thanks and prayers

 of education all the grace
 which makes her both the heart and place
 of general wonder but alack
 that monster envy oft the wrack
 of earned praise marina's life
 seeks to take off by treason's knife
 and in this kind hath our cleon
 one daughter and a wench full grown
 even ripe for marriagerite this maid
 hight philoten and it is said
 for certain in our story she
 would ever with marina be
 be't when she weaved the sleided silk
 with fingers long small white as milk
 or when she would with sharp needle wound
 the cambric which she made more sound
 by hurting it or when to the lute
 she sung and made the nightbird mute
 that still records with moan or when
 she would with rich and constant pen
 vail to her mistress dian still
 this philoten contends in skill
 with absolute marina so
 with the dove of paphos might the crow
 vie feathers white marina gets
 all praises which are paid as debts
 and not as given this so darks
 in philoten all graceful marks
 that cleon's wife with envy rare
 a present murderer does prepare
 for good marina that her daughter
 might stand peerless by this slaughter

leonine if you require a little space for prayer
 i grant it pray but be not tedious
 for the gods are quick of ear and i am sworn

 now as i can remember by my troth
 i never did her hurt in all my life

 to any living creature believe me la
 i never kill'd a mouse nor hurt a fly
 i trod upon a worm against my will
 but i wept for it how have i offended
 wherein my death might yield her any profit
 or my life imply her any danger
leonine my commission
 is not to reason of the deed but do it
marina you will not do't for all the world i hope
 you are well favour'd and your looks foreshow

 come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the
 sun

 should lodge them with this sign
bawd to marina pray you come hither awhile you
 have fortunes coming upon you mark me you must
 seem to do that fearfully which you commit
 willingly despise profit where you have most gain
 to weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
 lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good
 opinion and that opinion a mere profit
marina i understand you not

 blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise

 bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go

cleon o dionyza such a piece of slaughter
 the sun and moon ne'er look'd upon
dionyza i think
 you'll turn a child again
cleon were i chief lord of all this spacious world
 i'ld give it to undo the deed o lady
 much less in blood than virtue yet a princess
 to equal any single crown o the earth
 i the justice of compare o villain leonine
 whom thou hast poison'd too
 if thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness
 becoming well thy fact what canst thou say
 when noble pericles shall demand his child
dionyza that she is dead nurses are not the fates
 to foster it nor ever to preserve
 she died at night i'll say so who can cross it
 unless you play the pious innocent
 and for an honest attribute cry out
 she died by foul play'
cleon o go to well well
 of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods
 do like this worst
dionyza be one of those that think
 the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence
 and open this to pericles i do shame
 to think of what a noble strain you are
 and of how coward a spirit
cleon to such proceeding
 who ever but his approbation added
 though not his prime consent he did not flow
 from honourable sources
dionyza be it so then
 yet none does know but you how she came dead
 nor none can know leonine being gone
 she did disdain my child and stood between
 her and her fortunes none would look on her
 but cast their gazes on marina's face
 whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
 not worth the time of day it pierced me through
 and though you call my course unnatural
 you not your child well loving yet i find
 it greets me as an enterprise of kindness
 perform'd to your sole daughter
cleon heavens forgive it
dionyza and as for pericles
 what should he say we wept after her hearse
 and yet we mourn her monument
 is almost finish'd and her epitaphs
 in glittering golden characters express
 a general praise to her and care in us
 at whose expense tis done
cleon thou art like the harpy
 which to betray dost with thine angel's face
 seize with thine eagle's talons
dionyza you are like one that superstitiously
 doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies

 where our scenes seem to live i do beseech you
 to learn of me who stand i the gaps to teach you
 the stages of our story pericles
 is now again thwarting the wayward seas
 attended on by many a lord and knight
 to see his daughter all his life's delight
 old escanes whom helicanus late
 advanced in time to great and high estate
 is left to govern bear you it in mind
 old helicanus goes along behind

 see how belief may suffer by foul show
 this borrow'd passion stands for true old woe
 and pericles in sorrow all devour'd
 with sighs shot through and biggest tears
 o'ershower'd
 leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears
 never to wash his face nor cut his hairs
 he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears
 a tempest which his mortal vessel tears
 and yet he rides it out now please you wit
 the epitaph is for marina writ
 by wicked dionyza
 reads the inscription on marina's monument
 the fairest sweet'st and best lies here
 who wither'd in her spring of year
 she was of tyrus the king's daughter
 on whom foul death hath made this slaughter
 marina was she call'd and at her birth
 thetis being proud swallow'd some part o the earth
 therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflow'd
 hath thetis birthchild on the heavens bestow'd
 wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint
 make raging battery upon shores of flint'
 no visor does become black villany
 so well as soft and tender flattery

 serve by indenture to the common hangman
 any of these ways are yet better than this

 that doth frequent your house
boult well i will see what i can do for thee if i can

gower marina thus the brothel scapes and chances
 into an honest house our story says
 she sings like one immortal and she dances
 as goddesslike to her admired lays
 deep clerks she dumbs and with her needle composes
 nature's own shape of bud bird branch or berry
 that even her art sisters the natural roses
 her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry
 that pupils lacks she none of noble race
 who pour their bounty on her and her gain
 she gives the cursed bawd here we her place
 and to her father turn our thoughts again
 where we left him on the sea we there him lost
 whence driven before the winds he is arrived
 here where his daughter dwells and on this coast
 suppose him now at anchor the city strived
 god neptune's annual feast to keep from whence
 lysimachus our tyrian ship espies
 his banners sable trimm'd with rich expense
 and to him in his barge with fervor hies

act v
scene i on board pericles ship off mytilene a close
 pavilion on deck with a curtain before it pericles
 within it reclined on a couch a barge lying
 beside the tyrian vessel
 enter two sailors one belonging to the tyrian
 vessel the other to the barge to them helicanus
tyrian sailor to the sailor of mytilene where is lord helicanus
 he can resolve you
 o here he is
 sir there's a barge put off from mytilene
 and in it is lysimachus the governor
 who craves to come aboard what is your will
helicanus that he have his call up some gentlemen
tyrian sailor ho gentlemen my lord calls
 enter two or three gentlemen
first gentleman doth your lordship call
helicanus gentlemen there's some of worth would come aboard
 i pray ye greet them fairly
 the gentlemen and the two sailors descend and go
 on board the barge
 enter from thence lysimachus and lords with the
 gentlemen and the two sailors
tyrian sailor sir
 this is the man that can in aught you would
 resolve you
lysimachus hail reverend sir the gods preserve you
helicanus and you sir to outlive the age i am
 and die as i would do
lysimachus you wish me well
 being on shore honouring of neptune's triumphs
 seeing this goodly vessel ride before us
 i made to it to know of whence you are
helicanus first what is your place
lysimachus i am the governor of this place you lie before
helicanus sir
 our vessel is of tyre in it the king
 a man who for this three months hath not spoken
 to any one nor taken sustenance
 but to prorogue his grief
lysimachus upon what ground is his distemperature
helicanus twould be too tedious to repeat
 but the main grief springs from the loss
 of a beloved daughter and a wife
lysimachus may we not see him
helicanus you may
 but bootless is your sight he will not speak to any
lysimachus yet let me obtain my wish
helicanus behold him
 pericles discovered
 this was a goodly person
 till the disaster that one mortal night
 drove him to this
lysimachus sir king all hail the gods preserve you
 hail royal sir
helicanus it is in vain he will not speak to you
first lord sir
 we have a maid in mytilene i durst wager
 would win some words of him
lysimachus tis well bethought
 she questionless with her sweet harmony
 and other chosen attractions would allure
 and make a battery through his deafen'd parts
 which now are midway stopp'd
 she is all happy as the fairest of all
 and with her fellow maids is now upon
 the leafy shelter that abuts against
 the island's side
 whispers a lord who goes off in the barge of
 lysimachus
helicanus sure all's effectless yet nothing we'll omit
 that bears recovery's name but since your kindness
 we have stretch'd thus far let us beseech you
 that for our gold we may provision have
 wherein we are not destitute for want
 but weary for the staleness
lysimachus o sir a courtesy
 which if we should deny the most just gods
 for every graff would send a caterpillar
 and so afflict our province yet once more
 let me entreat to know at large the cause
 of your king's sorrow
helicanus sit sir i will recount it to you
 but see i am prevented
 reenter from the barge lord with marina and a
 young lady
lysimachus o here is
 the lady that i sent for welcome fair one
 is't not a goodly presence
helicanus she's a gallant lady
lysimachus she's such a one that were i well assured
 came of a gentle kind and noble stock
 i'ld wish no better choice and think me rarely wed
 fair one all goodness that consists in bounty
 expect even here where is a kingly patient
 if that thy prosperous and artificial feat
 can draw him but to answer thee in aught
 thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
 as thy desires can wish
marina sir i will use
 my utmost skill in his recovery provided
 that none but i and my companion maid
 be suffer'd to come near him
lysimachus come let us leave her
 and the gods make her prosperous
 marina sings
lysimachus mark'd he your music
marina no nor look'd on us
lysimachus see she will speak to him
marina hail sir my lord lend ear
pericles hum ha
marina i am a maid
 my lord that ne'er before invited eyes
 but have been gazed on like a comet she speaks
 my lord that may be hath endured a grief
 might equal yours if both were justly weigh'd
 though wayward fortune did malign my state
 my derivation was from ancestors
 who stood equivalent with mighty kings
 but time hath rooted out my parentage
 and to the world and awkward casualties
 bound me in servitude
 aside
 i will desist
 but there is something glows upon my cheek
 and whispers in mine ear go not till he speak'
pericles my fortunesparentagegood parentage
 to equal minewas it not thus what say you
marina i said my lord if you did know my parentage
 you would not do me violence
pericles i do think so pray you turn your eyes upon me
 you are like something thatwhat countrywoman
 here of these shores
marina no nor of any shores
 yet i was mortally brought forth and am
 no other than i appear
pericles i am great with woe and shall deliver weeping
 my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one
 my daughter might have been my queen's square brows
 her stature to an inch as wandlike straight
 as silvervoiced her eyes as jewellike
 and cased as richly in pace another juno
 who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry
 the more she gives them speech where do you live
marina where i am but a stranger from the deck
 you may discern the place
pericles where were you bred
 and how achieved you these endowments which
 you make more rich to owe
marina if i should tell my history it would seem
 like lies disdain'd in the reporting
pericles prithee speak
 falseness cannot come from thee for thou look'st
 modest as justice and thou seem'st a palace
 for the crown'd truth to dwell in i will
 believe thee
 and make my senses credit thy relation
 to points that seem impossible for thou look'st
 like one i loved indeed what were thy friends
 didst thou not say when i did push thee back
 which was when i perceived theethat thou camest
 from good descending
marina so indeed i did
pericles report thy parentage i think thou said'st
 thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury
 and that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine
 if both were open'd
marina some such thing
 i said and said no more but what my thoughts
 did warrant me was likely
pericles tell thy story
 if thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
 of my endurance thou art a man and i
 have suffer'd like a girl yet thou dost look
 like patience gazing on kings graves and smiling
 extremity out of act what were thy friends
 how lost thou them thy name my most kind virgin
 recount i do beseech thee come sit by me
marina my name is marina
pericles o i am mock'd
 and thou by some incensed god sent hither
 to make the world to laugh at me
marina patience good sir
 or here i'll cease
pericles nay i'll be patient
 thou little know'st how thou dost startle me
 to call thyself marina
marina the name
 was given me by one that had some power
 my father and a king
pericles how a king's daughter
 and call'd marina
marina you said you would believe me
 but not to be a troubler of your peace
 i will end here
pericles but are you flesh and blood
 have you a working pulse and are no fairy
 motion well speak on where were you born
 and wherefore call'd marina
marina call'd marina
 for i was born at sea
pericles at sea what mother
marina my mother was the daughter of a king
 who died the minute i was born
 as my good nurse lychorida hath oft
 deliver'd weeping
pericles o stop there a little
 aside
 this is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
 did mock sad fools withal this cannot be
 my daughter's buried well where were you bred
 i'll hear you more to the bottom of your story
 and never interrupt you
marina you scorn believe me twere best i did give o'er
pericles i will believe you by the syllable
 of what you shall deliver yet give me leave
 how came you in these parts where were you bred
marina the king my father did in tarsus leave me
 till cruel cleon with his wicked wife
 did seek to murder me and having woo'd
 a villain to attempt it who having drawn to do't
 a crew of pirates came and rescued me
 brought me to mytilene but good sir
 whither will you have me why do you weep
 it may be
 you think me an impostor no good faith
 i am the daughter to king pericles
 if good king pericles be
pericles ho helicanus
helicanus calls my lord
pericles thou art a grave and noble counsellor
 most wise in general tell me if thou canst
 what this maid is or what is like to be
 that thus hath made me weep
helicanus i know not but
 here is the regent sir of mytilene
 speaks nobly of her
lysimachus she would never tell
 her parentage being demanded that
 she would sit still and weep
pericles o helicanus strike me honour'd sir
 give me a gash put me to present pain
 lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
 o'erbear the shores of my mortality
 and drown me with their sweetness o come hither
 thou that beget'st him that did thee beget
 thou that wast born at sea buried at tarsus
 and found at sea again o helicanus
 down on thy knees thank the holy gods as loud
 as thunder threatens us this is marina
 what was thy mother's name tell me but that
 for truth can never be confirm'd enough
 though doubts did ever sleep
marina first sir i pray
 what is your title
pericles i am pericles of tyre but tell me now
 my drown'd queen's name as in the rest you said
 thou hast been godlike perfect
 the heir of kingdoms and another like
 to pericles thy father
marina is it no more to be your daughter than
 to say my mother's name was thaisa
 thaisa was my mother who did end
 the minute i began
pericles now blessing on thee rise thou art my child
 give me fresh garments mine own helicanus
 she is not dead at tarsus as she should have been
 by savage cleon she shall tell thee all
 when thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge
 she is thy very princess who is this
helicanus sir tis the governor of mytilene
 who hearing of your melancholy state
 did come to see you
pericles i embrace you
 give me my robes i am wild in my beholding
 o heavens bless my girl but hark what music
 tell helicanus my marina tell him
 o'er point by point for yet he seems to doubt
 how sure you are my daughter but what music
helicanus my lord i hear none
pericles none
 the music of the spheres list my marina
lysimachus it is not good to cross him give him way
pericles rarest sounds do ye not hear
lysimachus my lord i hear
 music
pericles most heavenly music
 it nips me unto listening and thick slumber
 hangs upon mine eyes let me rest
 sleeps
lysimachus a pillow for his head
 so leave him all well my companion friends
 if this but answer to my just belief
 i'll well remember you
 exeunt all but pericles
 diana appears to pericles as in a vision
diana my temple stands in ephesus hie thee thither
 and do upon mine altar sacrifice
 there when my maiden priests are met together
 before the people all
 reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife
 to mourn thy crosses with thy daughter's call
 and give them repetition to the life
 or perform my bidding or thou livest in woe
 do it and happy by my silver bow
 awake and tell thy dream
 disappears
pericles celestial dian goddess argentine
 i will obey thee helicanus

 and give you gold for such provision
 as our intents will need
lysimachus sir

 i have another suit
pericles you shall prevail
 were it to woo my daughter for it seems
 you have been noble towards her

 more a little and then dumb
 this my last boon give me
 for such kindness must relieve me
 that you aptly will suppose
 what pageantry what feats what shows
 what minstrelsy and pretty din
 the regent made in mytilene
 to greet the king so he thrived
 that he is promised to be wived
 to fair marina but in no wise
 till he had done his sacrifice
 as dian bade whereto being bound
 the interim pray you all confound
 in feather'd briefness sails are fill'd

 at sea in childbed died she but brought forth
 a maidchild call'd marina who o goddess
 wears yet thy silver livery she at tarsus
 was nursed with cleon who at fourteen years
 he sought to murder but her better stars
 brought her to mytilene gainst whose shore
 riding her fortunes brought the maid aboard us
 where by her own most clear remembrance she
 made known herself my daughter
thaisa voice and favour
 you are you areo royal pericles

cerimon upon this coast i warrant you
pericles tis most certain
cerimon look to the lady o she's but o'erjoy'd
 early in blustering morn this lady was
 thrown upon this shore i oped the coffin
 found there rich jewels recover'd her and placed her
 here in diana's temple
pericles may we see them
cerimon great sir they shall be brought you to my house
 whither i invite you look thaisa is recovered
thaisa o let me look
 if he be none of mine my sanctity
 will to my sense bend no licentious ear
 but curb it spite of seeing o my lord
 are you not pericles like him you spake
 like him you are did you not name a tempest
 a birth and death
pericles the voice of dead thaisa
thaisa that thaisa am i supposed dead
 and drown'd
pericles immortal dian
thaisa now i know you better
 when we with tears parted pentapolis
 the king my father gave you such a ring
 shows a ring
pericles this this no more you gods your present kindness
 makes my past miseries sports you shall do well
 that on the touching of her lips i may
 melt and no more be seen o come be buried
 a second time within these arms
marina my heart
 leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom
 kneels to thaisa
pericles look who kneels here flesh of thy flesh thaisa
 thy burden at the sea and call'd marina
 for she was yielded there
thaisa blest and mine own
helicanus hail madam and my queen
thaisa i know you not
pericles you have heard me say when i did fly from tyre
 i left behind an ancient substitute
 can you remember what i call'd the man
 i have named him oft
thaisa twas helicanus then
pericles still confirmation
 embrace him dear thaisa this is he
 now do i long to hear how you were found
 how possibly preserved and who to thank
 besides the gods for this great miracle
thaisa lord cerimon my lord this man
 through whom the gods have shown their power that can
 from first to last resolve you
pericles reverend sir
 the gods can have no mortal officer
 more like a god than you will you deliver
 how this dead queen relives
cerimon i will my lord
 beseech you first go with me to my house
 where shall be shown you all was found with her
 how she came placed here in the temple
 no needful thing omitted
pericles pure dian bless thee for thy vision i
 will offer nightoblations to thee thaisa
 this prince the fairbetrothed of your daughter
 shall marry her at pentapolis and now
 this ornament
 makes me look dismal will i clip to form
 and what this fourteen years no razor touch'd
 to grace thy marriageday i'll beautify
thaisa lord cerimon hath letters of good credit sir
 my father's dead
pericles heavens make a star of him yet there my queen
 we'll celebrate their nuptials and ourselves
 will in that kingdom spend our following days
 our son and daughter shall in tyrus reign
 lord cerimon we do our longing stay
 to hear the rest untold sir lead's the way
 exeunt
 enter gower
gower in antiochus and his daughter you have heard
 of monstrous lust the due and just reward
 in pericles his queen and daughter seen
 although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen
 virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast
 led on by heaven and crown'd with joy at last
 in helicanus may you well descry
 a figure of truth of faith of loyalty
 in reverend cerimon there well appears
 the worth that learned charity aye wears
 for wicked cleon and his wife when fame
 had spread their cursed deed and honour'd name
 of pericles to rage the city turn
 that him and his they in his palace burn
 the gods for murder seemed so content
 to punish them although not done but meant
 so on your patience evermore attending
 new joy wait on you here our play has ending

 with his good will and thy good company
 my trusty servant well approved in all

 a course of learning and ingenious studies
 pisa renown'd for grave citizens

 to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds

 virtue and that part of philosophy
 will i apply that treats of happiness
 by virtue specially to be achieved

 a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
 and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
tranio mi perdonato gentle master mine
 i am in all affected as yourself
 glad that you thus continue your resolve
 to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
 only good master while we do admire
 this virtue and this moral discipline
 let's be no stoics nor no stocks i pray
 or so devote to aristotle's cheques
 as ovid be an outcast quite abjured
 balk logic with acquaintance that you have
 and practise rhetoric in your common talk
 music and poesy use to quicken you
 the mathematics and the metaphysics
 fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
 no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en
 in brief sir study what you most affect
lucentio gramercies tranio well dost thou advise

hortensio mates maid how mean you that no mates for you
 unless you were of gentler milder mould
katharina i'faith sir you shall never need to fear

 but if it were doubt not her care should be
 to comb your noddle with a threelegg'd stool
 and paint your face and use you like a fool
hortensia from all such devils good lord deliver us
gremio and me too good lord
tranio hush master here's some good pastime toward

 signior baptista for this fiend of hell
 and make her bear the penance of her tongue
baptista gentlemen content ye i am resolved

 and for i know she taketh most delight
 in music instruments and poetry
 schoolmasters will i keep within my house
 fit to instruct her youth if you hortensio
 or signior gremio you know any such
 prefer them hither for to cunning men
 i will be very kind and liberal
 to mine own children in good bringing up
 and so farewell katharina you may stay
 for i have more to commune with bianca
 exit
katharina why and i trust i may go too may i not what
 shall i be appointed hours as though belike i
 knew not what to take and what to leave ha
 exit
gremio you may go to the devil's dam your gifts are so
 good here's none will hold you their love is not
 so great hortensio but we may blow our nails
 together and fast it fairly out our cakes dough on
 both sides farewell yet for the love i bear my
 sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit
 man to teach her that wherein she delights i will
 wish him to her father
hortensio so will i signior gremio but a word i pray
 though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
 parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both
 that we may yet again have access to our fair
 mistress and be happy rivals in bianco's love to
 labour and effect one thing specially
gremio what's that i pray
hortensio marry sir to get a husband for her sister
gremio a husband a devil
hortensio i say a husband
gremio i say a devil thinkest thou hortensio though
 her father be very rich any man is so very a fool
 to be married to hell
hortensio tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine
 to endure her loud alarums why man there be good
 fellows in the world an a man could light on them
 would take her with all faults and money enough
gremio i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with
 this condition to be whipped at the high cross
 every morning
hortensio faith as you say there's small choice in rotten
 apples but come since this bar in law makes us
 friends it shall be so far forth friendly
 maintained all by helping baptista's eldest daughter
 to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband
 and then have to't a fresh sweet bianca happy man
 be his dole he that runs fastest gets the ring
 how say you signior gremio
gremio i am agreed and would i had given him the best
 horse in padua to begin his wooing that would
 thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the
 house of her come on
 exeunt gremio and hortensio
tranio i pray sir tell me is it possible
 that love should of a sudden take such hold
lucentio o tranio till i found it to be true
 i never thought it possible or likely
 but see while idly i stood looking on
 i found the effect of love in idleness
 and now in plainness do confess to thee
 that art to me as secret and as dear
 as anna to the queen of carthage was
 tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio
 if i achieve not this young modest girl
 counsel me tranio for i know thou canst
 assist me tranio for i know thou wilt
tranio master it is no time to chide you now
 affection is not rated from the heart
 if love have touch'd you nought remains but so
 redime te captum quam queas minimo'
lucentio gramercies lad go forward this contents
 the rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound
tranio master you look'd so longly on the maid
 perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all
lucentio o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face
 such as the daughter of agenor had
 that made great jove to humble him to her hand
 when with his knees he kiss'd the cretan strand
tranio saw you no more mark'd you not how her sister
 began to scold and raise up such a storm
 that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
lucentio tranio i saw her coral lips to move
 and with her breath she did perfume the air
 sacred and sweet was all i saw in her
tranio nay then tis time to stir him from his trance
 i pray awake sir if you love the maid
 bend thoughts and wits to achieve her thus it stands
 her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
 that till the father rid his hands of her
 master your love must live a maid at home
 and therefore has he closely mew'd her up
 because she will not be annoy'd with suitors
lucentio ah tranio what a cruel father's he
 but art thou not advised he took some care
 to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
tranio ay marry am i sir and now tis plotted
lucentio i have it tranio
tranio master for my hand
 both our inventions meet and jump in one
lucentio tell me thine first
tranio you will be schoolmaster
 and undertake the teaching of the maid
 that's your device
lucentio it is may it be done
tranio not possible for who shall bear your part
 and be in padua here vincentio's son
 keep house and ply his book welcome his friends
 visit his countrymen and banquet them
lucentio basta content thee for i have it full
 we have not yet been seen in any house
 nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
 for man or master then it follows thus
 thou shalt be master tranio in my stead
 keep house and port and servants as i should
 i will some other be some florentine
 some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa
 tis hatch'd and shall be so tranio at once
 uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak
 when biondello comes he waits on thee
 but i will charm him first to keep his tongue
tranio so had you need
 in brief sir sith it your pleasure is
 and i am tied to be obedient
 for so your father charged me at our parting
 be serviceable to my son quoth he
 although i think twas in another sense
 i am content to be lucentio
 because so well i love lucentio
lucentio tranio be so because lucentio loves
 and let me be a slave to achieve that maid
 whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye
 here comes the rogue
 enter biondello
 sirrah where have you been
biondello where have i been nay how now where are you
 master has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes or
 you stolen his or both pray what's the news
lucentio sirrah come hither tis no time to jest
 and therefore frame your manners to the time
 your fellow tranio here to save my life
 puts my apparel and my countenance on
 and i for my escape have put on his
 for in a quarrel since i came ashore
 i kill'd a man and fear i was descried
 wait you on him i charge you as becomes
 while i make way from hence to save my life
 you understand me
biondello i sir ne'er a whit
lucentio and not a jot of tranio in your mouth
 tranio is changed into lucentio
biondello the better for him would i were so too
tranio so could i faith boy to have the next wish after
 that lucentio indeed had baptista's youngest daughter
 but sirrah not for my sake but your master's i advise
 you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
 when i am alone why then i am tranio
 but in all places else your master lucentio
lucentio tranio let's go one thing more rests that
 thyself execute to make one among these wooers if
 thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good
 and weighty

act i
scene ii padua before hortensio's house
 enter petruchio and his man grumio
petruchio verona for a while i take my leave
 to see my friends in padua but of all
 my best beloved and approved friend
 hortensio and i trow this is his house
 here sirrah grumio knock i say
grumio knock sir whom should i knock is there man has
 rebused your worship
petruchio villain i say knock me here soundly
grumio knock you here sir why sir what am i sir that
 i should knock you here sir
petruchio villain i say knock me at this gate
 and rap me well or i'll knock your knave's pate
grumio my master is grown quarrelsome i should knock
 you first
 and then i know after who comes by the worst
petruchio will it not be
 faith sirrah an you'll not knock i'll ring it
 i'll try how you can sol fa and sing it
 he wrings him by the ears
grumio help masters help my master is mad
petruchio now knock when i bid you sirrah villain
 enter hortensio
hortensio how now what's the matter my old friend grumio
 and my good friend petruchio how do you all at verona
petruchio signior hortensio come you to part the fray
 con tutto il cuore ben trovato may i say
hortensio alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor
 mio petruchio rise grumio rise we will compound
 this quarrel
grumio nay tis no matter sir what he leges in latin
 if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
 service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap
 him soundly sir well was it fit for a servant to
 use his master so being perhaps for aught i see
 two and thirty a pip out whom would to god i had
 well knock'd at first then had not grumio come by the worst
petruchio a senseless villain good hortensio
 i bade the rascal knock upon your gate
 and could not get him for my heart to do it
grumio knock at the gate o heavens spake you not these
 words plain sirrah knock me here rap me here
 knock me well and knock me soundly and come you
 now with knocking at the gate'
petruchio sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you
hortensio petruchio patience i am grumio's pledge
 why this's a heavy chance twixt him and you
 your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio
 and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
 blows you to padua here from old verona
petruchio such wind as scatters young men through the world
 to seek their fortunes farther than at home
 where small experience grows but in a few
 signior hortensio thus it stands with me
 antonio my father is deceased
 and i have thrust myself into this maze
 haply to wive and thrive as best i may
 crowns in my purse i have and goods at home
 and so am come abroad to see the world
hortensio petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee
 and wish thee to a shrewd illfavour'd wife
 thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel
 and yet i'll promise thee she shall be rich
 and very rich but thou'rt too much my friend
 and i'll not wish thee to her
petruchio signior hortensio twixt such friends as we
 few words suffice and therefore if thou know
 one rich enough to be petruchio's wife
 as wealth is burden of my wooing dance
 be she as foul as was florentius love
 as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
 as socrates xanthippe or a worse
 she moves me not or not removes at least
 affection's edge in me were she as rough
 as are the swelling adriatic seas
 i come to wive it wealthily in padua
 if wealthily then happily in padua
grumio nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his
 mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to
 a puppet or an agletbaby or an old trot with ne'er
 a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases
 as two and fifty horses why nothing comes amiss
 so money comes withal
hortensio petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in
 i will continue that i broach'd in jest
 i can petruchio help thee to a wife
 with wealth enough and young and beauteous
 brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
 her only fault and that is faults enough
 is that she is intolerable curst
 and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
 that were my state far worser than it is
 i would not wed her for a mine of gold
petruchio hortensio peace thou know'st not gold's effect
 tell me her father's name and tis enough
 for i will board her though she chide as loud
 as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
hortensio her father is baptista minola
 an affable and courteous gentleman
 her name is katharina minola
 renown'd in padua for her scolding tongue
petruchio i know her father though i know not her
 and he knew my deceased father well
 i will not sleep hortensio till i see her
 and therefore let me be thus bold with you
 to give you over at this first encounter
 unless you will accompany me thither
grumio i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts
 o my word an she knew him as well as i do she
 would think scolding would do little good upon him
 she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so
 why that's nothing an he begin once he'll rail in
 his ropetricks i'll tell you what sir an she
 stand him but a little he will throw a figure in
 her face and so disfigure her with it that she
 shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat
 you know him not sir
hortensio tarry petruchio i must go with thee
 for in baptista's keep my treasure is
 he hath the jewel of my life in hold
 his youngest daughter beautiful binaca
 and her withholds from me and other more
 suitors to her and rivals in my love
 supposing it a thing impossible
 for those defects i have before rehearsed
 that ever katharina will be woo'd
 therefore this order hath baptista ta'en
 that none shall have access unto bianca
 till katharina the curst have got a husband
grumio katharina the curst
 a title for a maid of all titles the worst
hortensio now shall my friend petruchio do me grace
 and offer me disguised in sober robes
 to old baptista as a schoolmaster
 well seen in music to instruct bianca
 that so i may by this device at least
 have leave and leisure to make love to her
 and unsuspected court her by herself
grumio here's no knavery see to beguile the old folks
 how the young folks lay their heads together
 enter gremio and lucentio disguised
 master master look about you who goes there ha
hortensio peace grumio it is the rival of my love
 petruchio stand by a while
grumio a proper stripling and an amorous
gremio o very well i have perused the note
 hark you sir i'll have them very fairly bound
 all books of love see that at any hand
 and see you read no other lectures to her
 you understand me over and beside
 signior baptista's liberality
 i'll mend it with a largess take your paper too
 and let me have them very well perfumed
 for she is sweeter than perfume itself
 to whom they go to what will you read to her
lucentio whate'er i read to her i'll plead for you
 as for my patron stand you so assured
 as firmly as yourself were still in place
 yea and perhaps with more successful words
 than you unless you were a scholar sir
gremio o this learning what a thing it is
grumio o this woodcock what an ass it is
petruchio peace sirrah
hortensio grumio mum god save you signior gremio
gremio and you are well met signior hortensio
 trow you whither i am going to baptista minola
 i promised to inquire carefully
 about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca
 and by good fortune i have lighted well
 on this young man for learning and behavior
 fit for her turn well read in poetry
 and other books good ones i warrant ye
hortensio tis well and i have met a gentleman
 hath promised me to help me to another
 a fine musician to instruct our mistress
 so shall i no whit be behind in duty
 to fair bianca so beloved of me
gremio beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove
grumio and that his bags shall prove
hortensio gremio tis now no time to vent our love
 listen to me and if you speak me fair
 i'll tell you news indifferent good for either
 here is a gentleman whom by chance i met
 upon agreement from us to his liking
 will undertake to woo curst katharina
 yea and to marry her if her dowry please
gremio so said so done is well
 hortensio have you told him all her faults
petruchio i know she is an irksome brawling scold
 if that be all masters i hear no harm
gremio no say'st me so friend what countryman
petruchio born in verona old antonio's son
 my father dead my fortune lives for me
 and i do hope good days and long to see
gremio o sir such a life with such a wife were strange
 but if you have a stomach to't i god's name
 you shall have me assisting you in all
 but will you woo this wildcat
petruchio will i live
grumio will he woo her ay or i'll hang her
petruchio why came i hither but to that intent
 think you a little din can daunt mine ears
 have i not in my time heard lions roar
 have i not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
 rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
 have i not heard great ordnance in the field
 and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies
 have i not in a pitched battle heard
 loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang
 and do you tell me of a woman's tongue
 that gives not half so great a blow to hear
 as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire
 tush tush fear boys with bugs
grumio for he fears none
gremio hortensio hark
 this gentleman is happily arrived
 my mind presumes for his own good and ours
hortensio i promised we would be contributors
 and bear his charging of wooing whatsoe'er
gremio and so we will provided that he win her
grumio i would i were as sure of a good dinner
 enter tranio brave and biondello
tranio gentlemen god save you if i may be bold
 tell me i beseech you which is the readiest way
 to the house of signior baptista minola
biondello he that has the two fair daughters is't he you mean
tranio even he biondello

tranio perhaps him and her sir what have you to do
petruchio not her that chides sir at any hand i pray
tranio i love no chiders sir biondello let's away
lucentio well begun tranio
hortensio sir a word ere you go
 are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
tranio and if i be sir is it any offence
gremio no if without more words you will get you hence
tranio why sir i pray are not the streets as free
 for me as for you
gremio but so is not she
tranio for what reason i beseech you
gremio for this reason if you'll know
 that she's the choice love of signior gremio
hortensio that she's the chosen of signior hortensio
tranio softly my masters if you be gentlemen
 do me this right hear me with patience
 baptista is a noble gentleman
 to whom my father is not all unknown
 and were his daughter fairer than she is
 she may more suitors have and me for one
 fair leda's daughter had a thousand wooers
 then well one more may fair bianca have
 and so she shall lucentio shall make one
 though paris came in hope to speed alone
gremio what this gentleman will outtalk us all
lucentio sir give him head i know he'll prove a jade
petruchio hortensio to what end are all these words
hortensio sir let me be so bold as ask you
 did you yet ever see baptista's daughter
tranio no sir but hear i do that he hath two
 the one as famous for a scolding tongue
 as is the other for beauteous modesty
petruchio sir sir the first's for me let her go by
gremio yea leave that labour to great hercules
 and let it be more than alcides twelve
petruchio sir understand you this of me in sooth
 the youngest daughter whom you hearken for
 her father keeps from all access of suitors
 and will not promise her to any man
 until the elder sister first be wed
 the younger then is free and not before
tranio if it be so sir that you are the man
 must stead us all and me amongst the rest
 and if you break the ice and do this feat
 achieve the elder set the younger free
 for our access whose hap shall be to have her
 will not so graceless be to be ingrate
hortensio sir you say well and well you do conceive
 and since you do profess to be a suitor
 you must as we do gratify this gentleman
 to whom we all rest generally beholding
tranio sir i shall not be slack in sign whereof
 please ye we may contrive this afternoon
 and quaff carouses to our mistress health
 and do as adversaries do in law
 strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
grumio

 you knew my father well and in him me
 left solely heir to all his lands and goods
 which i have better'd rather than decreased
 then tell me if i get your daughter's love
 what dowry shall i have with her to wife
baptista after my death the one half of my lands
 and in possession twenty thousand crowns
petruchio and for that dowry i'll assure her of
 her widowhood be it that she survive me
 in all my lands and leases whatsoever
 let specialties be therefore drawn between us
 that covenants may be kept on either hand
baptista ay when the special thing is well obtain'd
 that is her love for that is all in all
petruchio why that is nothing for i tell you father
 i am as peremptory as she proudminded
 and where two raging fires meet together
 they do consume the thing that feeds their fury
 though little fire grows great with little wind
 yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
 so i to her and so she yields to me
 for i am rough and woo not like a babe
baptista well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
 but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words
petruchio ay to the proof as mountains are for winds
 that shake not though they blow perpetually
 reenter hortensio with his head broke
baptista how now my friend why dost thou look so pale
hortensio for fear i promise you if i look pale
baptista what will my daughter prove a good musician
hortensio i think she'll sooner prove a soldier
 iron may hold with her but never lutes
baptista why then thou canst not break her to the lute
hortensio why no for she hath broke the lute to me
 i did but tell her she mistook her frets
 and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering
 when with a most impatient devilish spirit
 frets call you these quoth she i'll fume
 with them'
 and with that word she struck me on the head
 and through the instrument my pate made way
 and there i stood amazed for a while
 as on a pillory looking through the lute
 while she did call me rascal fiddler
 and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms
 as had she studied to misuse me so
petruchio now by the world it is a lusty wench
 i love her ten times more than e'er i did
 o how i long to have some chat with her
baptista well go with me and be not so discomfited
 proceed in practise with my younger daughter
 she's apt to learn and thankful for good turns
 signior petruchio will you go with us
 or shall i send my daughter kate to you
petruchio i pray you do
 exeunt all but petruchio
 i will attend her here
 and woo her with some spirit when she comes
 say that she rail why then i'll tell her plain
 she sings as sweetly as a nightingale
 say that she frown i'll say she looks as clear
 as morning roses newly wash'd with dew
 say she be mute and will not speak a word
 then i'll commend her volubility
 and say she uttereth piercing eloquence
 if she do bid me pack i'll give her thanks
 as though she bid me stay by her a week
 if she deny to wed i'll crave the day
 when i shall ask the banns and when be married
 but here she comes and now petruchio speak
 enter katharina
 good morrow kate for that's your name i hear
katharina well have you heard but something hard of hearing
 they call me katharina that do talk of me
petruchio you lie in faith for you are call'd plain kate
 and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst
 but kate the prettiest kate in christendom
 kate of kate hall my superdainty kate
 for dainties are all kates and therefore kate
 take this of me kate of my consolation
 hearing thy mildness praised in every town
 thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
 yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
 myself am moved to woo thee for my wife
katharina moved in good time let him that moved you hither
 remove you hence i knew you at the first
 you were a moveable
petruchio why what's a moveable
katharina a join'dstool
petruchio thou hast hit it come sit on me
katharina asses are made to bear and so are you
petruchio women are made to bear and so are you
katharina no such jade as you if me you mean
petruchio alas good kate i will not burden thee
 for knowing thee to be but young and light
katharina too light for such a swain as you to catch
 and yet as heavy as my weight should be
petruchio should be shouldbuzz
katharina well ta'en and like a buzzard
petruchio o slowwing'd turtle shall a buzzard take thee
katharina ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
petruchio come come you wasp i faith you are too angry
katharina if i be waspish best beware my sting
petruchio my remedy is then to pluck it out
katharina ay if the fool could find it where it lies
petruchio who knows not where a wasp does
 wear his sting in his tail
katharina in his tongue
petruchio whose tongue
katharina yours if you talk of tails and so farewell
petruchio what with my tongue in your tail nay come again
 good kate i am a gentleman
katharina that i'll try
 she strikes him
petruchio i swear i'll cuff you if you strike again
katharina so may you lose your arms
 if you strike me you are no gentleman
 and if no gentleman why then no arms
petruchio a herald kate o put me in thy books
katharina what is your crest a coxcomb
petruchio a combless cock so kate will be my hen
katharina no cock of mine you crow too like a craven
petruchio nay come kate come you must not look so sour
katharina it is my fashion when i see a crab
petruchio why here's no crab and therefore look not sour
katharina there is there is
petruchio then show it me
katharina had i a glass i would
petruchio what you mean my face
katharina well aim'd of such a young one
petruchio now by saint george i am too young for you
katharina yet you are wither'd
petruchio tis with cares
katharina i care not
petruchio nay hear you kate in sooth you scape not so
katharina i chafe you if i tarry let me go
petruchio no not a whit i find you passing gentle
 twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
 and now i find report a very liar
 for thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous
 but slow in speech yet sweet as springtime flowers
 thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
 nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
 nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
 but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers
 with gentle conference soft and affable
 why does the world report that kate doth limp
 o slanderous world kate like the hazeltwig
 is straight and slender and as brown in hue
 as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
 o let me see thee walk thou dost not halt
katharina go fool and whom thou keep'st command
petruchio did ever dian so become a grove
 as kate this chamber with her princely gait
 o be thou dian and let her be kate
 and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful
katharina where did you study all this goodly speech
petruchio it is extempore from my motherwit
katharina a witty mother witless else her son
petruchio am i not wise
katharina yes keep you warm
petruchio marry so i mean sweet katharina in thy bed
 and therefore setting all this chat aside
 thus in plain terms your father hath consented
 that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
 and will you nill you i will marry you
 now kate i am a husband for your turn
 for by this light whereby i see thy beauty
 thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
 thou must be married to no man but me
 for i am he am born to tame you kate
 and bring you from a wild kate to a kate
 conformable as other household kates
 here comes your father never make denial
 i must and will have katharina to my wife
 reenter baptista gremio and tranio
baptista now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter
petruchio how but well sir how but well
 it were impossible i should speed amiss
baptista why how now daughter katharina in your dumps
katharina call you me daughter now i promise you
 you have show'd a tender fatherly regard
 to wish me wed to one half lunatic
 a madcup ruffian and a swearing jack
 that thinks with oaths to face the matter out
petruchio father tis thus yourself and all the world
 that talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her
 if she be curst it is for policy
 for she's not froward but modest as the dove
 she is not hot but temperate as the morn
 for patience she will prove a second grissel
 and roman lucrece for her chastity
 and to conclude we have greed so well together
 that upon sunday is the weddingday
katharina i'll see thee hang'd on sunday first
gremio hark petruchio she says she'll see thee
 hang'd first
tranio is this your speeding nay then good night our part

 how much she loves me o the kindest kate
 she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
 she vied so fast protesting oath on oath
 that in a twink she won me to her love

 how tame when men and women are alone
 a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
 give me thy hand kate i will unto venice

 if i may have your daughter to my wife
 i'll leave her houses three or four as good
 within rich pisa walls as any one
 old signior gremio has in padua
 besides two thousand ducats by the year
 of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
 what have i pinch'd you signior gremio
gremio two thousand ducats by the year of land
 my land amounts not to so much in all
 that she shall have besides an argosy

 by your firm promise gremio is outvied
baptista i must confess your offer is the best
 and let your father make her the assurance

 and when in music we have spent an hour
 your lecture shall have leisure for as much
lucentio preposterous ass that never read so far
 to know the cause why music was ordain'd
 was it not to refresh the mind of man
 after his studies or his usual pain
 then give me leave to read philosophy
 and while i pause serve in your harmony
hortensio sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine
bianca why gentlemen you do me double wrong
 to strive for that which resteth in my choice
 i am no breeching scholar in the schools
 i'll not be tied to hours nor pointed times
 but learn my lessons as i please myself
 and to cut off all strife here sit we down
 take you your instrument play you the whiles
 his lecture will be done ere you have tuned

 how fiery and forward our pedant is
 now for my life the knave doth court my love
 pedascule i'll watch you better yet
bianca in time i may believe yet i mistrust
lucentio mistrust it not for sure aeacides
 was ajax call'd so from his grandfather
bianca i must believe my master else i promise you
 i should be arguing still upon that doubt
 but let it rest now licio to you
 good masters take it not unkindly pray
 that i have been thus pleasant with you both
hortensio you may go walk and give me leave a while
 my lessons make no music in three parts
lucentio are you so formal sir well i must wait
 aside
 and watch withal for but i be deceived
 our fine musician groweth amorous
hortensio madam before you touch the instrument
 to learn the order of my fingering
 i must begin with rudiments of art
 to teach you gamut in a briefer sort
 more pleasant pithy and effectual
 than hath been taught by any of my trade
 and there it is in writing fairly drawn
bianca why i am past my gamut long ago
hortensio yet read the gamut of hortensio
bianca reads 'gamut i am the ground of all accord
 a re to plead hortensio's passion
 b mi bianca take him for thy lord
 c fa ut that loves with all affection

hortensio but i have cause to pry into this pedant
 methinks he looks as though he were in love
 yet if thy thoughts bianca be so humble
 to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale
 seize thee that list if once i find thee ranging
 hortensio will be quit with thee by changing

scene ii padua before baptista's house
 enter baptista gremio tranio katharina bianca
 lucentio and others attendants
baptista to tranio signior lucentio this is the
 pointed day
 that katharina and petruchio should be married
 and yet we hear not of our soninlaw
 what will be said what mockery will it be
 to want the bridegroom when the priest attends
 to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
 what says lucentio to this shame of ours
katharina no shame but mine i must forsooth be forced
 to give my hand opposed against my heart
 unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen
 who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure
 i told you i he was a frantic fool
 hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior
 and to be noted for a merry man
 he'll woo a thousand point the day of marriage
 make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns
 yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd
 now must the world point at poor katharina
 and say lo there is mad petruchio's wife
 if it would please him come and marry her'
tranio patience good katharina and baptista too
 upon my life petruchio means but well
 whatever fortune stays him from his word
 though he be blunt i know him passing wise
 though he be merry yet withal he's honest
katharina would katharina had never seen him though
 exit weeping followed by bianca and others
baptista go girl i cannot blame thee now to weep
 for such an injury would vex a very saint
 much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
 enter biondello
biondello master master news old news and such news as
 you never heard of
baptista is it new and old too how may that be
biondello why is it not news to hear of petruchio's coming
baptista is he come
biondello why no sir
baptista what then
biondello he is coming
baptista when will he be here
biondello when he stands where i am and sees you there
tranio but say what to thine old news
biondello why petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
 jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair
 of boots that have been candlecases one buckled
 another laced an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
 townarmory with a broken hilt and chapeless
 with two broken points his horse hipped with an
 old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred
 besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose
 in the chine troubled with the lampass infected
 with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with
 spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives
 stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the
 bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten
 nearlegged before and with a halfchequed bit
 and a headstall of sheeps leather which being
 restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been
 often burst and now repaired with knots one girth
 six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure
 which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
 in studs and here and there pieced with packthread
baptista who comes with him
biondello o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned
 like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a
 kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red
 and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty
 fancies pricked in't for a feather a monster a
 very monster in apparel and not like a christian
 footboy or a gentleman's lackey
tranio tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion
 yet oftentimes he goes but meanapparell'd
baptista i am glad he's come howsoe'er he comes
biondello why sir he comes not
baptista didst thou not say he comes
biondello who that petruchio came
baptista ay that petruchio came
biondello no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back
baptista why that's all one
biondello nay by saint jamy
 i hold you a penny
 a horse and a man
 is more than one
 and yet not many
 enter petruchio and grumio
petruchio come where be these gallants who's at home
baptista you are welcome sir
petruchio and yet i come not well
baptista and yet you halt not
tranio not so well apparell'd
 as i wish you were
petruchio were it better i should rush in thus
 but where is kate where is my lovely bride
 how does my father gentles methinks you frown
 and wherefore gaze this goodly company
 as if they saw some wondrous monument
 some comet or unusual prodigy
baptista why sir you know this is your weddingday
 first were we sad fearing you would not come
 now sadder that you come so unprovided
 fie doff this habit shame to your estate
 an eyesore to our solemn festival
tranio and tells us what occasion of import
 hath all so long detain'd you from your wife
 and sent you hither so unlike yourself
petruchio tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
 sufficeth i am come to keep my word
 though in some part enforced to digress
 which at more leisure i will so excuse
 as you shall well be satisfied withal
 but where is kate i stay too long from her
 the morning wears tis time we were at church
tranio see not your bride in these unreverent robes
 go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
petruchio not i believe me thus i'll visit her
baptista but thus i trust you will not marry her
petruchio good sooth even thus therefore ha done with words
 to me she's married not unto my clothes
 could i repair what she will wear in me
 as i can change these poor accoutrements
 twere well for kate and better for myself
 but what a fool am i to chat with you
 when i should bid good morrow to my bride
 and seal the title with a lovely kiss
 exeunt petruchio and grumio
tranio he hath some meaning in his mad attire
 we will persuade him be it possible
 to put on better ere he go to church
baptista i'll after him and see the event of this
 exeunt baptista gremio and attendants
tranio but to her love concerneth us to add
 her father's liking which to bring to pass
 as i before unparted to your worship
 i am to get a manwhate'er he be
 it skills not much we'll fit him to our turn
 and he shall be vincentio of pisa
 and make assurance here in padua
 of greater sums than i have promised
 so shall you quietly enjoy your hope
 and marry sweet bianca with consent
lucentio were it not that my fellowschoolmaster
 doth watch bianca's steps so narrowly
 twere good methinks to steal our marriage
 which once perform'd let all the world say no
 i'll keep mine own despite of all the world
tranio that by degrees we mean to look into
 and watch our vantage in this business
 we'll overreach the greybeard gremio
 the narrowprying father minola
 the quaint musician amorous licio
 all for my master's sake lucentio
 reenter gremio
 signior gremio came you from the church
gremio as willingly as e'er i came from school
tranio and is the bride and bridegroom coming home
gremio a bridegroom say you tis a groom indeed
 a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
tranio curster than she why tis impossible
gremio why he's a devil a devil a very fiend
tranio why she's a devil a devil the devil's dam
gremio tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him
 i'll tell you sir lucentio when the priest
 should ask if katharina should be his wife
 ay by gogswouns quoth he and swore so loud
 that allamazed the priest let fall the book
 and as he stoop'd again to take it up
 the madbrain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
 that down fell priest and book and book and priest
 now take them up quoth he if any list'
tranio what said the wench when he rose again
gremio trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore
 as if the vicar meant to cozen him
 but after many ceremonies done
 he calls for wine a health quoth he as if
 he had been aboard carousing to his mates
 after a storm quaff'd off the muscadel
 and threw the sops all in the sexton's face
 having no other reason
 but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
 and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking
 this done he took the bride about the neck
 and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
 that at the parting all the church did echo
 and i seeing this came thence for very shame
 and after me i know the rout is coming
 such a mad marriage never was before
 hark hark i hear the minstrels play
 music

 reenter petruchio
petruchio thus have i politicly begun my reign
 and tis my hope to end successfully
 my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
 and till she stoop she must not be fullgorged
 for then she never looks upon her lure
 another way i have to man my haggard
 to make her come and know her keeper's call
 that is to watch her as we watch these kites
 that bate and beat and will not be obedient
 she eat no meat today nor none shall eat
 last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
 as with the meat some undeserved fault
 i'll find about the making of the bed
 and here i'll fling the pillow there the bolster
 this way the coverlet another way the sheets
 ay and amid this hurly i intend
 that all is done in reverend care of her
 and in conclusion she shall watch all night
 and if she chance to nod i'll rail and brawl
 and with the clamour keep her still awake
 this is a way to kill a wife with kindness
 and thus i'll curb her mad and headstrong humour
 he that knows better how to tame a shrew
 now let him speak tis charity to show

 loved none in the world so well as lucentio
tranio o despiteful love unconstant womankind
 i tell thee licio this is wonderful
hortensio mistake no more i am not licio

 but one that scorn to live in this disguise
 for such a one as leaves a gentleman
 and makes a god of such a cullion
 know sir that i am call'd hortensio
tranio signior hortensio i have often heard
 of your entire affection to bianca
 and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
 i will with you if you be so contented
 forswear bianca and her love for ever
hortensio see how they kiss and court signior lucentio
 here is my hand and here i firmly vow
 never to woo her no more but do forswear her
 as one unworthy all the former favours
 that i have fondly flatter'd her withal
tranio and here i take the unfeigned oath
 never to marry with her though she would entreat
 fie on her see how beastly she doth court him
hortensio would all the world but he had quite forsworn
 for me that i may surely keep mine oath
 i will be married to a wealthy widow
 ere three days pass which hath as long loved me
 as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard
 and so farewell signior lucentio
 kindness in women not their beauteous looks
 shall win my love and so i take my leave
 in resolution as i swore before

 this favour will i do you for his sake
 and think it not the worst of an your fortunes
 that you are like to sir vincentio
 his name and credit shall you undertake

 beggars that come unto my father's door
 upon entreaty have a present aims
 if not elsewhere they meet with charity
 but i who never knew how to entreat
 nor never needed that i should entreat
 am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep
 with oath kept waking and with brawling fed
 and that which spites me more than all these wants
 he does it under name of perfect love
 as who should say if i should sleep or eat
 twere deadly sickness or else present death
 i prithee go and get me some repast
 i care not what so it be wholesome food
grumio what say you to a neat's foot

 away with it come let me have a bigger
katharina i'll have no bigger this doth fit the time
 and gentlewomen wear such caps as these
petruchio when you are gentle you shall have one too

katharina why sir i trust i may have leave to speak
 and speak i will i am no child no babe
 your betters have endured me say my mind
 and if you cannot best you stop your ears
 my tongue will tell the anger of my heart
 or else my heart concealing it will break
 and rather than it shall i will be free
 even to the uttermost as i please in words
petruchio why thou say'st true it is a paltry cap
 a custardcoffin a bauble a silken pie
 i love thee well in that thou likest it not

 why what i devil's name tailor call'st thou this
hortensio aside i see she's like to have neither cap nor gown
tailor you bid me make it orderly and well
 according to the fashion and the time
petruchio marry and did but if you be remember'd
 i did not bid you mar it to the time
 go hop me over every kennel home

 thee i bid thy master cut out the gown but i did
 not bid him cut it to pieces ergo thou liest
tailor why here is the note of the fashion to testify
petruchio read it
grumio the note lies in's throat if he say i said so
tailor reads imprimis a loosebodied gown'
grumio master if ever i said loosebodied gown sew me in
 the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom
 of brown thread i said a gown
petruchio proceed
tailor reads with a small compassed cape'
grumio i confess the cape

 sewed up again and that i'll prove upon thee
 though thy little finger be armed in a thimble

 because his fathers are more beautiful
 or is the adder better than the eel
 because his painted skin contents the eye
 o no good kate neither art thou the worse
 for this poor furniture and mean array
 if thou account'st it shame lay it on me

tranio o sir lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound
 which runs himself and catches for his master
petruchio a good swift simile but something currish
tranio tis well sir that you hunted for yourself

baptista o ho petruchio tranio hits you now
lucentio i thank thee for that gird good tranio
hortensio confess confess hath he not hit you here

 and he whose wife is most obedient
 to come at first when he doth send for her

petruchio i hope better
hortensio sirrah biondello go and entreat my wife
 to come to me forthwith
 exit biondello
petruchio o ho entreat her

hortensio i am afraid sir
 do what you can yours will not be entreated
 reenter biondello
 now where's my wife
biondello she says you have some goodly jest in hand
 she will not come she bids you come to her
petruchio worse and worse she will not come o vile
 intolerable not to be endured
 sirrah grumio go to your mistress
 say i command her to come to me
 exit grumio
hortensio i know her answer
petruchio what
hortensio she will not
petruchio the fouler fortune mine and there an end
baptista now by my holidame here comes katharina
 reenter katarina
katharina what is your will sir that you send for me
petruchio where is your sister and hortensio's wife
katharina they sit conferring by the parlor fire
petruchio go fetch them hither if they deny to come
 swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
 away i say and bring them hither straight
 exit katharina
lucentio here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
hortensio and so it is i wonder what it bodes
petruchio marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
 and awful rule and right supremacy
 and to be short what not that's sweet and happy
baptista now fair befal thee good petruchio
 the wager thou hast won and i will add
 unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
 another dowry to another daughter
 for she is changed as she had never been
petruchio nay i will win my wager better yet
 and show more sign of her obedience
 her newbuilt virtue and obedience
 see where she comes and brings your froward wives
 as prisoners to her womanly persuasion
 reenter katharina with bianca and widow
 katharina that cap of yours becomes you not
 off with that bauble throw it underfoot
widow lord let me never have a cause to sigh
 till i be brought to such a silly pass
bianca fie what a foolish duty call you this
lucentio i would your duty were as foolish too
 the wisdom of your duty fair bianca
 hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime
bianca the more fool you for laying on my duty
petruchio katharina i charge thee tell these headstrong women
 what duty they do owe their lords and husbands
widow come come you're mocking we will have no telling
petruchio come on i say and first begin with her
widow she shall not
petruchio i say she shall and first begin with her
katharina fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
 and dart not scornful glances from those eyes
 to wound thy lord thy king thy governor
 it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
 confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
 and in no sense is meet or amiable
 a woman moved is like a fountain troubled
 muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty
 and while it is so none so dry or thirsty
 will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
 thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
 thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
 and for thy maintenance commits his body
 to painful labour both by sea and land
 to watch the night in storms the day in cold
 whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
 and craves no other tribute at thy hands
 but love fair looks and true obedience
 too little payment for so great a debt
 such duty as the subject owes the prince
 even such a woman oweth to her husband
 and when she is froward peevish sullen sour
 and not obedient to his honest will
 what is she but a foul contending rebel
 and graceless traitor to her loving lord
 i am ashamed that women are so simple
 to offer war where they should kneel for peace
 or seek for rule supremacy and sway
 when they are bound to serve love and obey
 why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
 unapt to toil and trouble in the world
 but that our soft conditions and our hearts
 should well agree with our external parts
 come come you froward and unable worms
 my mind hath been as big as one of yours
 my heart as great my reason haply more
 to bandy word for word and frown for frown
 but now i see our lances are but straws
 our strength as weak our weakness past compare
 that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
 then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
 and place your hands below your husband's foot
 in token of which duty if he please
 my hand is ready may it do him ease
petruchio why there's a wench come on and kiss me kate
lucentio well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't
vincentio tis a good hearing when children are toward
lucentio but a harsh hearing when women are froward
petruchio come kate we'll to bed
 we three are married but you two are sped
 to lucentio
 twas i won the wager though you hit the white
 and being a winner god give you good night
 exeunt petruchio and katharina
hortensio now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew
lucentio tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so

act i
scene ii the island before prospero's cell
 enter prospero and miranda
miranda if by your art my dearest father you have
 put the wild waters in this roar allay them
 the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
 but that the sea mounting to the welkin's cheek
 dashes the fire out o i have suffered
 with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel
 who had no doubt some noble creature in her
 dash'd all to pieces o the cry did knock
 against my very heart poor souls they perish'd
 had i been any god of power i would
 have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
 it should the good ship so have swallow'd and
 the fraughting souls within her
prospero be collected
 no more amazement tell your piteous heart
 there's no harm done
miranda o woe the day
prospero no harm
 i have done nothing but in care of thee
 of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
 art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
 of whence i am nor that i am more better
 than prospero master of a full poor cell
 and thy no greater father
miranda more to know
 did never meddle with my thoughts
prospero tis time
 i should inform thee farther lend thy hand
 and pluck my magic garment from me so
 lays down his mantle
 lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
 the direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd
 the very virtue of compassion in thee
 i have with such provision in mine art
 so safely ordered that there is no soul
 no not so much perdition as an hair
 betid to any creature in the vessel
 which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink sit down
 for thou must now know farther
miranda you have often
 begun to tell me what i am but stopp'd
 and left me to a bootless inquisition
 concluding stay not yet'
prospero the hour's now come
 the very minute bids thee ope thine ear
 obey and be attentive canst thou remember
 a time before we came unto this cell
 i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
 out three years old
miranda certainly sir i can
prospero by what by any other house or person
 of any thing the image tell me that
 hath kept with thy remembrance
miranda tis far off
 and rather like a dream than an assurance
 that my remembrance warrants had i not
 four or five women once that tended me
prospero thou hadst and more miranda but how is it
 that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else
 in the dark backward and abysm of time
 if thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here
 how thou camest here thou mayst
miranda but that i do not
prospero twelve year since miranda twelve year since
 thy father was the duke of milan and
 a prince of power
miranda sir are not you my father
prospero thy mother was a piece of virtue and
 she said thou wast my daughter and thy father
 was duke of milan and thou his only heir
 and princess no worse issued
miranda o the heavens
 what foul play had we that we came from thence
 or blessed was't we did
prospero both both my girl
 by foul play as thou say'st were we heaved thence
 but blessedly holp hither
miranda o my heart bleeds
 to think o the teen that i have turn'd you to
 which is from my remembrance please you farther
prospero my brother and thy uncle call'd antonio
 i pray thee mark methat a brother should
 be so perfidioushe whom next thyself
 of all the world i loved and to him put
 the manage of my state as at that time
 through all the signories it was the first
 and prospero the prime duke being so reputed
 in dignity and for the liberal arts
 without a parallel those being all my study
 the government i cast upon my brother
 and to my state grew stranger being transported
 and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle
 dost thou attend me
miranda sir most heedfully
prospero being once perfected how to grant suits
 how to deny them who to advance and who
 to trash for overtopping new created
 the creatures that were mine i say or changed em
 or else new form'd em having both the key
 of officer and office set all hearts i the state
 to what tune pleased his ear that now he was
 the ivy which had hid my princely trunk
 and suck'd my verdure out on't thou attend'st not
miranda o good sir i do
prospero i pray thee mark me
 i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
 to closeness and the bettering of my mind
 with that which but by being so retired
 o'erprized all popular rate in my false brother
 awaked an evil nature and my trust
 like a good parent did beget of him
 a falsehood in its contrary as great
 as my trust was which had indeed no limit
 a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded
 not only with what my revenue yielded
 but what my power might else exact like one
 who having into truth by telling of it
 made such a sinner of his memory
 to credit his own lie he did believe
 he was indeed the duke out o the substitution
 and executing the outward face of royalty
 with all prerogative hence his ambition growing
 dost thou hear
miranda your tale sir would cure deafness
prospero to have no screen between this part he play'd
 and him he play'd it for he needs will be
 absolute milan me poor man my library
 was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties
 he thinks me now incapable confederates
 so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples
 to give him annual tribute do him homage
 subject his coronet to his crown and bend
 the dukedom yet unbow'dalas poor milan
 to most ignoble stooping
miranda o the heavens
prospero mark his condition and the event then tell me
 if this might be a brother
miranda i should sin
 to think but nobly of my grandmother
 good wombs have borne bad sons
prospero now the condition
 the king of naples being an enemy
 to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit
 which was that he in lieu o the premises
 of homage and i know not how much tribute
 should presently extirpate me and mine
 out of the dukedom and confer fair milan
 with all the honours on my brother whereon
 a treacherous army levied one midnight
 fated to the purpose did antonio open
 the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness
 the ministers for the purpose hurried thence
 me and thy crying self
miranda alack for pity
 i not remembering how i cried out then
 will cry it o'er again it is a hint
 that wrings mine eyes to't
prospero hear a little further
 and then i'll bring thee to the present business
 which now's upon's without the which this story
 were most impertinent
miranda wherefore did they not
 that hour destroy us
prospero well demanded wench
 my tale provokes that question dear they durst not
 so dear the love my people bore me nor set
 a mark so bloody on the business but
 with colours fairer painted their foul ends
 in few they hurried us aboard a bark
 bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
 a rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd
 nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
 instinctively had quit it there they hoist us
 to cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh
 to the winds whose pity sighing back again
 did us but loving wrong
miranda alack what trouble
 was i then to you
prospero o a cherubim
 thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile
 infused with a fortitude from heaven
 when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt
 under my burthen groan'd which raised in me
 an undergoing stomach to bear up
 against what should ensue
miranda how came we ashore
prospero by providence divine
 some food we had and some fresh water that
 a noble neapolitan gonzalo
 out of his charity being then appointed
 master of this design did give us with
 rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
 which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
 knowing i loved my books he furnish'd me
 from mine own library with volumes that
 i prize above my dukedom
miranda would i might
 but ever see that man
prospero now i arise
 resumes his mantle
 sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow
 here in this island we arrived and here
 have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
 than other princesses can that have more time
 for vainer hours and tutors not so careful
miranda heavens thank you for't and now i pray you sir
 for still tis beating in my mind your reason
 for raising this seastorm
prospero know thus far forth
 by accident most strange bountiful fortune
 now my dear lady hath mine enemies
 brought to this shore and by my prescience
 i find my zenith doth depend upon
 a most auspicious star whose influence
 if now i court not but omit my fortunes
 will ever after droop here cease more questions
 thou art inclined to sleep tis a good dulness
 and give it way i know thou canst not choose
 miranda sleeps
 come away servant come i am ready now
 approach my ariel come
 enter ariel
ariel all hail great master grave sir hail i come
 to answer thy best pleasure be't to fly
 to swim to dive into the fire to ride
 on the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task
 ariel and all his quality
prospero hast thou spirit
 perform'd to point the tempest that i bade thee
ariel to every article
 i boarded the king's ship now on the beak
 now in the waist the deck in every cabin
 i flamed amazement sometime i'ld divide
 and burn in many places on the topmast
 the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly
 then meet and join jove's lightnings the precursors
 o the dreadful thunderclaps more momentary
 and sightoutrunning were not the fire and cracks
 of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune
 seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
 yea his dread trident shake
prospero my brave spirit
 who was so firm so constant that this coil
 would not infect his reason
ariel not a soul
 but felt a fever of the mad and play'd
 some tricks of desperation all but mariners
 plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel
 then all afire with me the king's son ferdinand
 with hair upstaringthen like reeds not hair
 was the first man that leap'd cried hell is empty
 and all the devils are here'
prospero why that's my spirit
 but was not this nigh shore
ariel close by my master
prospero but are they ariel safe
ariel not a hair perish'd
 on their sustaining garments not a blemish
 but fresher than before and as thou badest me
 in troops i have dispersed them bout the isle
 the king's son have i landed by himself
 whom i left cooling of the air with sighs
 in an odd angle of the isle and sitting
 his arms in this sad knot
prospero of the king's ship
 the mariners say how thou hast disposed
 and all the rest o the fleet
ariel safely in harbour
 is the king's ship in the deep nook where once
 thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
 from the stillvex'd bermoothes there she's hid
 the mariners all under hatches stow'd
 who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour
 i have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet
 which i dispersed they all have met again
 and are upon the mediterranean flote
 bound sadly home for naples
 supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
 and his great person perish
prospero ariel thy charge
 exactly is perform'd but there's more work
 what is the time o the day
ariel past the mid season
prospero at least two glasses the time twixt six and now
 must by us both be spent most preciously
ariel is there more toil since thou dost give me pains
 let me remember thee what thou hast promised
 which is not yet perform'd me
prospero how now moody
 what is't thou canst demand
ariel my liberty
prospero before the time be out no more
ariel i prithee
 remember i have done thee worthy service
 told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served
 without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise
 to bate me a full year
prospero dost thou forget
 from what a torment i did free thee
ariel no
prospero thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze
 of the salt deep
 to run upon the sharp wind of the north
 to do me business in the veins o the earth
 when it is baked with frost
ariel i do not sir
prospero thou liest malignant thing hast thou forgot
 the foul witch sycorax who with age and envy
 was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her
ariel no sir
prospero thou hast where was she born speak tell me
ariel sir in argier
prospero o was she so i must
 once in a month recount what thou hast been
 which thou forget'st this damn'd witch sycorax
 for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
 to enter human hearing from argier
 thou know'st was banish'd for one thing she did
 they would not take her life is not this true
ariel ay sir
prospero this blueeyed hag was hither brought with child
 and here was left by the sailors thou my slave
 as thou report'st thyself wast then her servant
 and for thou wast a spirit too delicate
 to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands
 refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
 by help of her more potent ministers
 and in her most unmitigable rage
 into a cloven pine within which rift
 imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
 a dozen years within which space she died
 and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
 as fast as millwheels strike then was this island
 save for the son that she did litter here
 a freckled whelp hagbornnot honour'd with
 a human shape
ariel yes caliban her son
prospero dull thing i say so he that caliban
 whom now i keep in service thou best know'st
 what torment i did find thee in thy groans
 did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
 of ever angry bears it was a torment
 to lay upon the damn'd which sycorax
 could not again undo it was mine art
 when i arrived and heard thee that made gape
 the pine and let thee out
ariel i thank thee master
prospero if thou more murmur'st i will rend an oak
 and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
 thou hast howl'd away twelve winters
ariel pardon master
 i will be correspondent to command
 and do my spiriting gently
prospero do so and after two days
 i will discharge thee
ariel that's my noble master
 what shall i do say what what shall i do
prospero go make thyself like a nymph o the sea be subject
 to no sight but thine and mine invisible
 to every eyeball else go take this shape
 and hither come in't go hence with diligence
 exit ariel
 awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well awake
miranda the strangeness of your story put
 heaviness in me
prospero shake it off come on
 we'll visit caliban my slave who never
 yields us kind answer
miranda tis a villain sir
 i do not love to look on
prospero but as tis
 we cannot miss him he does make our fire
 fetch in our wood and serves in offices
 that profit us what ho slave caliban
 thou earth thou speak
caliban within there's wood enough within
prospero come forth i say there's other business for thee

 exit
prospero thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
 upon thy wicked dam come forth
 enter caliban
caliban as wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
 with raven's feather from unwholesome fen
 drop on you both a southwest blow on ye
 and blister you all o'er
prospero for this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps
 sidestitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins
 shall for that vast of night that they may work
 all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd
 as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
 than bees that made em
caliban i must eat my dinner
 this island's mine by sycorax my mother
 which thou takest from me when thou camest first
 thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me
 water with berries in't and teach me how
 to name the bigger light and how the less
 that burn by day and night and then i loved thee
 and show'd thee all the qualities o the isle
 the fresh springs brinepits barren place and fertile
 cursed be i that did so all the charms
 of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
 for i am all the subjects that you have
 which first was mine own king and here you sty me
 in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
 the rest o the island
prospero thou most lying slave
 whom stripes may move not kindness i have used thee
 filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee
 in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
 the honour of my child
caliban o ho o ho would't had been done
 thou didst prevent me i had peopled else
 this isle with calibans
prospero abhorred slave
 which any print of goodness wilt not take
 being capable of all ill i pitied thee
 took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
 one thing or other when thou didst not savage
 know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
 a thing most brutish i endow'd thy purposes
 with words that made them known but thy vile race
 though thou didst learn had that in't which
 good natures
 could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
 deservedly confined into this rock
 who hadst deserved more than a prison
caliban you taught me language and my profit on't
 is i know how to curse the red plague rid you
 for learning me your language
prospero hagseed hence
 fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best
 to answer other business shrug'st thou malice
 if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
 what i command i'll rack thee with old cramps
 fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
 that beasts shall tremble at thy din
caliban no pray thee
 aside
 i must obey his art is of such power
 it would control my dam's god setebos
 and make a vassal of him
prospero so slave hence
 exit caliban
 reenter ariel invisible playing and singing
 ferdinand following
 ariel's song
 come unto these yellow sands
 and then take hands
 courtsied when you have and kiss'd
 the wild waves whist
 foot it featly here and there
 and sweet sprites the burthen bear
 hark hark
 burthen dispersedly within bowwow
 the watchdogs bark
 burthen bowwow
 hark hark i hear
 the strain of strutting chanticleer
 cry cockadiddledow
ferdinand where should this music be i the air or the earth
 it sounds no more and sure it waits upon
 some god o the island sitting on a bank
 weeping again the king my father's wreck
 this music crept by me upon the waters
 allaying both their fury and my passion
 with its sweet air thence i have follow'd it
 or it hath drawn me rather but tis gone
 no it begins again
 ariel sings
 full fathom five thy father lies
 of his bones are coral made
 those are pearls that were his eyes
 nothing of him that doth fade
 but doth suffer a seachange
 into something rich and strange
 seanymphs hourly ring his knell
 burthen dingdong
 hark now i hear themdingdong bell
ferdinand the ditty does remember my drown'd father
 this is no mortal business nor no sound
 that the earth owes i hear it now above me
prospero the fringed curtains of thine eye advance
 and say what thou seest yond
miranda what is't a spirit
 lord how it looks about believe me sir
 it carries a brave form but tis a spirit
prospero no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
 as we have such this gallant which thou seest
 was in the wreck and but he's something stain'd
 with grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him
 a goodly person he hath lost his fellows
 and strays about to find em
miranda i might call him
 a thing divine for nothing natural
 i ever saw so noble
prospero aside it goes on i see
 as my soul prompts it spirit fine spirit i'll free thee
 within two days for this
ferdinand most sure the goddess
 on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my prayer
 may know if you remain upon this island
 and that you will some good instruction give
 how i may bear me here my prime request
 which i do last pronounce is o you wonder
 if you be maid or no
miranda no wonder sir
 but certainly a maid
ferdinand my language heavens
 i am the best of them that speak this speech
 were i but where tis spoken
prospero how the best
 what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee
ferdinand a single thing as i am now that wonders
 to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me
 and that he does i weep myself am naples
 who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld
 the king my father wreck'd
miranda alack for mercy
ferdinand yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan
 and his brave son being twain
prospero aside the duke of milan
 and his more braver daughter could control thee
 if now twere fit to do't at the first sight
 they have changed eyes delicate ariel
 i'll set thee free for this
 to ferdinand
 a word good sir
 i fear you have done yourself some wrong a word
miranda why speaks my father so ungently this
 is the third man that e'er i saw the first
 that e'er i sigh'd for pity move my father
 to be inclined my way
ferdinand o if a virgin
 and your affection not gone forth i'll make you
 the queen of naples
prospero soft sir one word more
 aside
 they are both in either's powers but this swift business
 i must uneasy make lest too light winning
 make the prize light
 to ferdinand
 one word more i charge thee
 that thou attend me thou dost here usurp
 the name thou owest not and hast put thyself
 upon this island as a spy to win it
 from me the lord on't
ferdinand no as i am a man
miranda there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
 if the ill spirit have so fair a house
 good things will strive to dwell with't
prospero follow me
 speak not you for him he's a traitor come
 i'll manacle thy neck and feet together
 seawater shalt thou drink thy food shall be
 the freshbrook muscles wither'd roots and husks
 wherein the acorn cradled follow
ferdinand no
 i will resist such entertainment till
 mine enemy has more power
 draws and is charmed from moving
miranda o dear father
 make not too rash a trial of him for
 he's gentle and not fearful
prospero what i say
 my foot my tutor put thy sword up traitor
 who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience
 is so possess'd with guilt come from thy ward
 for i can here disarm thee with this stick
 and make thy weapon drop
miranda beseech you father
prospero hence hang not on my garments
miranda sir have pity
 i'll be his surety
prospero silence one word more
 shall make me chide thee if not hate thee what
 an advocate for an imposter hush
 thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he
 having seen but him and caliban foolish wench
 to the most of men this is a caliban
 and they to him are angels
miranda my affections
 are then most humble i have no ambition
 to see a goodlier man
prospero come on obey
 thy nerves are in their infancy again
 and have no vigour in them
ferdinand so they are
 my spirits as in a dream are all bound up
 my father's loss the weakness which i feel
 the wreck of all my friends nor this man's threats
 to whom i am subdued are but light to me
 might i but through my prison once a day
 behold this maid all corners else o the earth
 let liberty make use of space enough
 have i in such a prison
prospero aside it works
 to ferdinand
 come on
 thou hast done well fine ariel
 to ferdinand
 follow me
 to ariel
 hark what thou else shalt do me
miranda be of comfort
 my father's of a better nature sir
 than he appears by speech this is unwonted
 which now came from him
prospero thou shalt be free
 as mountain winds but then exactly do
 all points of my command
ariel to the syllable
prospero come follow speak not for him
 exeunt
 the tempest
act ii
scene i another part of the island
 enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo
 adrian francisco and others
gonzalo beseech you sir be merry you have cause
 so have we all of joy for our escape
 is much beyond our loss our hint of woe
 is common every day some sailor's wife
 the masters of some merchant and the merchant
 have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
 i mean our preservation few in millions
 can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh
 our sorrow with our comfort
alonso prithee peace
sebastian he receives comfort like cold porridge
antonio the visitor will not give him o'er so
sebastian look he's winding up the watch of his wit
 by and by it will strike
gonzalo sir
sebastian one tell
gonzalo when every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd
 comes to the entertainer
sebastian a dollar
gonzalo dolour comes to him indeed you
 have spoken truer than you purposed
sebastian you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should
gonzalo therefore my lord
antonio fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
alonso i prithee spare
gonzalo well i have done but yet
sebastian he will be talking
antonio which of he or adrian for a good
 wager first begins to crow
sebastian the old cock
antonio the cockerel
sebastian done the wager
antonio a laughter
sebastian a match
adrian though this island seem to be desert
sebastian ha ha ha so you're paid
adrian uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
sebastian yet
adrian yet
antonio he could not miss't
adrian it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate
 temperance
antonio temperance was a delicate wench
sebastian ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
adrian the air breathes upon us here most sweetly
sebastian as if it had lungs and rotten ones
antonio or as twere perfumed by a fen
gonzalo here is everything advantageous to life
antonio true save means to live
sebastian of that there's none or little
gonzalo how lush and lusty the grass looks how green
antonio the ground indeed is tawny
sebastian with an eye of green in't
antonio he misses not much
sebastian no he doth but mistake the truth totally
gonzalo but the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost
 beyond credit
sebastian as many vouched rarities are
gonzalo that our garments being as they were drenched in
 the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and
 glosses being rather newdyed than stained with
 salt water
antonio if but one of his pockets could speak would it not
 say he lies
sebastian ay or very falsely pocket up his report
gonzalo methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
 put them on first in afric at the marriage of
 the king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis
sebastian twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
adrian tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
 their queen
gonzalo not since widow dido's time
antonio widow a pox o that how came that widow in
 widow dido
sebastian what if he had said widower aeneas too good lord
 how you take it
adrian widow dido said you you make me study of that
 she was of carthage not of tunis
gonzalo this tunis sir was carthage
adrian carthage
gonzalo i assure you carthage
sebastian his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath
 raised the wall and houses too
antonio what impossible matter will he make easy next
sebastian i think he will carry this island home in his pocket
 and give it his son for an apple
antonio and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
 forth more islands
gonzalo ay
antonio why in good time
gonzalo sir we were talking that our garments seem now
 as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage
 of your daughter who is now queen
antonio and the rarest that e'er came there
sebastian bate i beseech you widow dido
antonio o widow dido ay widow dido
gonzalo is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i
 wore it i mean in a sort
antonio that sort was well fished for
gonzalo when i wore it at your daughter's marriage
alonso you cram these words into mine ears against
 the stomach of my sense would i had never
 married my daughter there for coming thence
 my son is lost and in my rate she too
 who is so far from italy removed
 i ne'er again shall see her o thou mine heir
 of naples and of milan what strange fish
 hath made his meal on thee
francisco sir he may live
 i saw him beat the surges under him
 and ride upon their backs he trod the water
 whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
 the surge most swoln that met him his bold head
 bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd
 himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
 to the shore that o'er his waveworn basis bow'd
 as stooping to relieve him i not doubt
 he came alive to land
alonso no no he's gone
sebastian sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
 that would not bless our europe with your daughter
 but rather lose her to an african
 where she at least is banish'd from your eye
 who hath cause to wet the grief on't
alonso prithee peace
sebastian you were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
 by all of us and the fair soul herself
 weigh'd between loathness and obedience at
 which end o the beam should bow we have lost your
 son
 i fear for ever milan and naples have
 more widows in them of this business making
 than we bring men to comfort them
 the fault's your own
alonso so is the dear'st o the loss
gonzalo my lord sebastian
 the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
 and time to speak it in you rub the sore
 when you should bring the plaster
sebastian very well
antonio and most chirurgeonly
gonzalo it is foul weather in us all good sir
 when you are cloudy
sebastian foul weather
antonio very foul
gonzalo had i plantation of this isle my lord
antonio he'ld sow't with nettleseed
sebastian or docks or mallows
gonzalo and were the king on't what would i do
sebastian scape being drunk for want of wine
gonzalo i the commonwealth i would by contraries
 execute all things for no kind of traffic
 would i admit no name of magistrate
 letters should not be known riches poverty
 and use of service none contract succession
 bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
 no use of metal corn or wine or oil
 no occupation all men idle all
 and women too but innocent and pure
 no sovereignty
sebastian yet he would be king on't
antonio the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
 beginning
gonzalo all things in common nature should produce
 without sweat or endeavour treason felony
 sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
 would i not have but nature should bring forth
 of its own kind all foison all abundance
 to feed my innocent people
sebastian no marrying mong his subjects
antonio none man all idle whores and knaves
gonzalo i would with such perfection govern sir
 to excel the golden age
sebastian god save his majesty
antonio long live gonzalo
gonzalo anddo you mark me sir
alonso prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me
gonzalo i do well believe your highness and
 did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen
 who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
 they always use to laugh at nothing
antonio twas you we laughed at
gonzalo who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
 to you so you may continue and laugh at
 nothing still
antonio what a blow was there given
sebastian an it had not fallen flatlong
gonzalo you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift
 the moon out of her sphere if she would continue
 in it five weeks without changing
 enter ariel invisible playing solemn music
sebastian we would so and then go a batfowling
antonio nay good my lord be not angry
gonzalo no i warrant you i will not adventure
 my discretion so weakly will you laugh
 me asleep for i am very heavy
antonio go sleep and hear us
 all sleep except alonso sebastian and antonio
alonso what all so soon asleep i wish mine eyes
 would with themselves shut up my thoughts i find
 they are inclined to do so
sebastian please you sir
 do not omit the heavy offer of it
 it seldom visits sorrow when it doth
 it is a comforter
antonio we two my lord
 will guard your person while you take your rest
 and watch your safety
alonso thank you wondrous heavy
 alonso sleeps exit ariel
sebastian what a strange drowsiness possesses them
antonio it is the quality o the climate
sebastian why
 doth it not then our eyelids sink i find not
 myself disposed to sleep
antonio nor i my spirits are nimble
 they fell together all as by consent
 they dropp'd as by a thunderstroke what might
 worthy sebastian o what mightno more
 and yet me thinks i see it in thy face
 what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and
 my strong imagination sees a crown
 dropping upon thy head
sebastian what art thou waking
antonio do you not hear me speak
sebastian i do and surely
 it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
 out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say
 this is a strange repose to be asleep
 with eyes wide open standing speaking moving
 and yet so fast asleep
antonio noble sebastian
 thou let'st thy fortune sleepdie rather wink'st
 whiles thou art waking
sebastian thou dost snore distinctly
 there's meaning in thy snores
antonio i am more serious than my custom you
 must be so too if heed me which to do
 trebles thee o'er
sebastian well i am standing water
antonio i'll teach you how to flow
sebastian do so to ebb
 hereditary sloth instructs me
antonio o
 if you but knew how you the purpose cherish
 whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
 you more invest it ebbing men indeed
 most often do so near the bottom run
 by their own fear or sloth
sebastian prithee say on
 the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
 a matter from thee and a birth indeed
 which throes thee much to yield
antonio thus sir
 although this lord of weak remembrance this
 who shall be of as little memory
 when he is earth'd hath here almost persuade
 for he's a spirit of persuasion only
 professes to persuadethe king his son's alive
 tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
 and he that sleeps here swims
sebastian i have no hope
 that he's undrown'd
antonio o out of that no hope'
 what great hope have you no hope that way is
 another way so high a hope that even
 ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
 but doubt discovery there will you grant with me
 that ferdinand is drown'd
sebastian he's gone
antonio then tell me
 who's the next heir of naples
sebastian claribel
antonio she that is queen of tunis she that dwells
 ten leagues beyond man's life she that from naples
 can have no note unless the sun were post
 the man i the moon's too slowtill newborn chins
 be rough and razorable she thatfrom whom
 we all were seaswallow'd though some cast again
 and by that destiny to perform an act
 whereof what's past is prologue what to come
 in yours and my discharge
sebastian what stuff is this how say you
 tis true my brother's daughter's queen of tunis
 so is she heir of naples twixt which regions
 there is some space
antonio a space whose every cubit
 seems to cry out how shall that claribel
 measure us back to naples keep in tunis
 and let sebastian wake say this were death
 that now hath seized them why they were no worse
 than now they are there be that can rule naples
 as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
 as amply and unnecessarily
 as this gonzalo i myself could make
 a chough of as deep chat o that you bore
 the mind that i do what a sleep were this
 for your advancement do you understand me
sebastian methinks i do
antonio and how does your content
 tender your own good fortune
sebastian i remember
 you did supplant your brother prospero
antonio true
 and look how well my garments sit upon me
 much feater than before my brother's servants
 were then my fellows now they are my men
sebastian but for your conscience
antonio ay sir where lies that if twere a kibe
 twould put me to my slipper but i feel not
 this deity in my bosom twenty consciences
 that stand twixt me and milan candied be they
 and melt ere they molest here lies your brother
 no better than the earth he lies upon
 if he were that which now he's like that's dead
 whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it
 can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
 to the perpetual wink for aye might put
 this ancient morsel this sir prudence who
 should not upbraid our course for all the rest
 they'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
 they'll tell the clock to any business that
 we say befits the hour
sebastian thy case dear friend
 shall be my precedent as thou got'st milan
 i'll come by naples draw thy sword one stroke
 shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest
 and i the king shall love thee
antonio draw together
 and when i rear my hand do you the like
 to fall it on gonzalo
sebastian o but one word
 they talk apart
 reenter ariel invisible
ariel my master through his art foresees the danger
 that you his friend are in and sends me forth
 for else his project diesto keep them living
 sings in gonzalo's ear
 while you here do snoring lie
 openeyed conspiracy
 his time doth take
 if of life you keep a care
 shake off slumber and beware
 awake awake
antonio then let us both be sudden
gonzalo now good angels
 preserve the king
 they wake
alonso why how now ho awake why are you drawn
 wherefore this ghastly looking
gonzalo what's the matter
sebastian whiles we stood here securing your repose
 even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
 like bulls or rather lions did't not wake you
 it struck mine ear most terribly
alonso i heard nothing
antonio o twas a din to fright a monster's ear
 to make an earthquake sure it was the roar
 of a whole herd of lions
alonso heard you this gonzalo
gonzalo upon mine honour sir i heard a humming
 and that a strange one too which did awake me
 i shaked you sir and cried as mine eyes open'd
 i saw their weapons drawn there was a noise
 that's verily tis best we stand upon our guard
 or that we quit this place let's draw our weapons
alonso lead off this ground and let's make further search
 for my poor son
gonzalo heavens keep him from these beasts
 for he is sure i the island
alonso lead away
ariel prospero my lord shall know what i have done
 so king go safely on to seek thy son

 thunder heard
caliban all the infections that the sun sucks up
 from bogs fens flats on prosper fall and make him
 by inchmeal a disease his spirits hear me
 and yet i needs must curse but they'll nor pinch
 fright me with urchinshows pitch me i the mire
 nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark
 out of my way unless he bid em but
 for every trifle are they set upon me
 sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
 and after bite me then like hedgehogs which
 lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
 their pricks at my footfall sometime am i
 all wound with adders who with cloven tongues
 do hiss me into madness
 enter trinculo
 lo now lo
 here comes a spirit of his and to torment me
 for bringing wood in slowly i'll fall flat
 perchance he will not mind me
trinculo here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off
 any weather at all and another storm brewing

 cloud yond huge one looks like a foul
 bombard that would shed his liquor if it
 should thunder as it did before i know not
 where to hide my head yond same cloud cannot
 choose but fall by pailfuls what have we

 beggar they will lazy out ten to see a dead
 indian legged like a man and his fins like
 arms warm o my troth i do now let loose

 thunderbolt
 thunder
 alas the storm is come again my best way is to
 creep under his gaberdine there is no other
 shelter hereabouts misery acquaints a man with
 strange bedfellows i will here shroud till the
 dregs of the storm be past
 enter stephano singing a bottle in his hand

 funeral well here's my comfort drinks

 the master the swabber the boatswain and i
 the gunner and his mate
 loved mall meg and marian and margery
 but none of us cared for kate
 for she had a tongue with a tang

 then to sea boys and let her go hang
 this is a scurvy tune too but here's my comfort
 drinks

 relief if it be but for that if i can recover him
 and keep him tame and get to naples with him he's a
 present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather
caliban do not torment me prithee i'll bring my wood home faster
stephano he's in his fit now and does not talk after the
 wisest he shall taste of my bottle if he have
 never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
 fit if i can recover him and keep him tame i will
 not take too much for him he shall pay for him that

act iii
scene i before prospero's cell
 enter ferdinand bearing a log
ferdinand there be some sports are painful and their labour
 delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
 are nobly undergone and most poor matters
 point to rich ends this my mean task
 would be as heavy to me as odious but
 the mistress which i serve quickens what's dead
 and makes my labours pleasures o she is
 ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed
 and he's composed of harshness i must remove
 some thousands of these logs and pile them up
 upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
 weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
 had never like executor i forget
 but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
 most busy lest when i do it
 enter miranda and prospero at a distance unseen
miranda alas now pray you
 work not so hard i would the lightning had
 burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile
 pray set it down and rest you when this burns
 twill weep for having wearied you my father
 is hard at study pray now rest yourself
 he's safe for these three hours
ferdinand o most dear mistress
 the sun will set before i shall discharge
 what i must strive to do
miranda if you'll sit down
 i'll bear your logs the while pray give me that
 i'll carry it to the pile
ferdinand no precious creature
 i had rather crack my sinews break my back
 than you should such dishonour undergo
 while i sit lazy by
miranda it would become me
 as well as it does you and i should do it
 with much more ease for my good will is to it
 and yours it is against
prospero poor worm thou art infected
 this visitation shows it
miranda you look wearily
ferdinand no noble mistress'tis fresh morning with me
 when you are by at night i do beseech you
 chiefly that i might set it in my prayers
 what is your name
miranda mirandao my father
 i have broke your hest to say so
ferdinand admired miranda
 indeed the top of admiration worth
 what's dearest to the world full many a lady
 i have eyed with best regard and many a time
 the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
 brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
 have i liked several women never any
 with so fun soul but some defect in her
 did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
 and put it to the foil but you o you
 so perfect and so peerless are created
 of every creature's best
miranda i do not know
 one of my sex no woman's face remember
 save from my glass mine own nor have i seen
 more that i may call men than you good friend
 and my dear father how features are abroad
 i am skilless of but by my modesty
 the jewel in my dower i would not wish
 any companion in the world but you
 nor can imagination form a shape
 besides yourself to like of but i prattle
 something too wildly and my father's precepts
 i therein do forget
ferdinand i am in my condition
 a prince miranda i do think a king
 i would not soand would no more endure
 this wooden slavery than to suffer
 the fleshfly blow my mouth hear my soul speak
 the very instant that i saw you did
 my heart fly to your service there resides
 to make me slave to it and for your sake
 am i this patient logman
miranda do you love me
ferdinand o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound
 and crown what i profess with kind event
 if i speak true if hollowly invert
 what best is boded me to mischief i
 beyond all limit of what else i the world
 do love prize honour you
miranda i am a fool
 to weep at what i am glad of
prospero fair encounter
 of two most rare affections heavens rain grace
 on that which breeds between em
ferdinand wherefore weep you
miranda at mine unworthiness that dare not offer
 what i desire to give and much less take
 what i shall die to want but this is trifling
 and all the more it seeks to hide itself
 the bigger bulk it shows hence bashful cunning
 and prompt me plain and holy innocence
 i am your wife it you will marry me
 if not i'll die your maid to be your fellow
 you may deny me but i'll be your servant
 whether you will or no
ferdinand my mistress dearest
 and i thus humble ever
miranda my husband then
ferdinand ay with a heart as willing
 as bondage e'er of freedom here's my hand
miranda and mine with my heart in't and now farewell
 till half an hour hence
ferdinand a thousand thousand
 exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally
prospero so glad of this as they i cannot be
 who are surprised withal but my rejoicing
 at nothing can be more i'll to my book
 for yet ere suppertime must i perform
 much business appertaining

 one spirit to command they all do hate him
 as rootedly as i burn but his books

 the beauty of his daughter he himself

 that if i then had waked after long sleep
 will make me sleep again and then in dreaming
 the clouds methought would open and show riches
 ready to drop upon me that when i waked
 i cried to dream again
stephano this will prove a brave kingdom to me where i shall
 have my music for nothing
caliban when prospero is destroyed
stephano that shall be by and by i remember the story

 adrian francisco and others
gonzalo by'r lakin i can go no further sir
 my old bones ache here's a maze trod indeed
 through forthrights and meanders by your patience
 i needs must rest me
alonso old lord i cannot blame thee
 who am myself attach'd with weariness
 to the dulling of my spirits sit down and rest
 even here i will put off my hope and keep it
 no longer for my flatterer he is drown'd
 whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks
 our frustrate search on land well let him go
antonio aside to sebastian i am right glad that he's so
 out of hope
 do not for one repulse forego the purpose
 that you resolved to effect
sebastian aside to antonio the next advantage
 will we take throughly
antonio aside to sebastian let it be tonight
 for now they are oppress'd with travel they
 will not nor cannot use such vigilance
 as when they are fresh
sebastian aside to antonio i say tonight no more
 solemn and strange music
alonso what harmony is this my good friends hark
gonzalo marvellous sweet music
 enter prospero above invisible enter several
 strange shapes bringing in a banquet
 they dance about it with gentle actions of
 salutation and inviting the king &c to
 eat they depart
alonso give us kind keepers heavens what were these
sebastian a living drollery now i will believe
 that there are unicorns that in arabia
 there is one tree the phoenix throne one phoenix
 at this hour reigning there
antonio i'll believe both
 and what does else want credit come to me
 and i'll be sworn tis true travellers ne'er did
 lie
 though fools at home condemn em
gonzalo if in naples
 i should report this now would they believe me
 if i should say i saw such islanders
 for certes these are people of the island
 who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
 their manners are more gentlekind than of
 our human generation you shall find
 many nay almost any
prospero aside honest lord
 thou hast said well for some of you there present
 are worse than devils
alonso i cannot too much muse
 such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
 although they want the use of tongue a kind
 of excellent dumb discourse
prospero aside praise in departing
francisco they vanish'd strangely
sebastian no matter since
 they have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
 will't please you taste of what is here
alonso not i
gonzalo faith sir you need not fear when we were boys
 who would believe that there were mountaineers
 dewlapp'd like bulls whose throats had hanging at em
 wallets of flesh or that there were such men
 whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
 each putterout of five for one will bring us
 good warrant of
alonso i will stand to and feed
 although my last no matter since i feel
 the best is past brother my lord the duke
 stand to and do as we
 thunder and lightning enter ariel like a
 harpy claps his wings upon the table and
 with a quaint device the banquet vanishes
ariel you are three men of sin whom destiny
 that hath to instrument this lower world
 and what is in't the neversurfeited sea
 hath caused to belch up you and on this island
 where man doth not inhabit you mongst men
 being most unfit to live i have made you mad
 and even with suchlike valour men hang and drown
 their proper selves
 alonso sebastian &c draw their swords
 you fools i and my fellows
 are ministers of fate the elements
 of whom your swords are temper'd may as well
 wound the loud winds or with bemock'dat stabs
 kill the stillclosing waters as diminish
 one dowle that's in my plume my fellowministers
 are like invulnerable if you could hurt
 your swords are now too massy for your strengths
 and will not be uplifted but remember
 for that's my business to youthat you three
 from milan did supplant good prospero
 exposed unto the sea which hath requit it
 him and his innocent child for which foul deed
 the powers delaying not forgetting have
 incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures
 against your peace thee of thy son alonso
 they have bereft and do pronounce by me
 lingering perdition worse than any death
 can be at once shall step by step attend
 you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from
 which here in this most desolate isle else falls
 upon your headsis nothing but heartsorrow
 and a clear life ensuing
 he vanishes in thunder then to soft music
 enter the shapes again and dance with
 mocks and mows and carrying out the table
prospero bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
 perform'd my ariel a grace it had devouring
 of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
 in what thou hadst to say so with good life
 and observation strange my meaner ministers
 their several kinds have done my high charms work
 and these mine enemies are all knit up
 in their distractions they now are in my power
 and in these fits i leave them while i visit
 young ferdinand whom they suppose is drown'd
 and his and mine loved darling
 exit above
gonzalo i the name of something holy sir why stand you
 in this strange stare
alonso o it is monstrous monstrous
 methought the billows spoke and told me of it
 the winds did sing it to me and the thunder
 that deep and dreadful organpipe pronounced
 the name of prosper it did bass my trespass
 therefore my son i the ooze is bedded and
 i'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
 and with him there lie mudded
 exit
sebastian but one fiend at a time
 i'll fight their legions o'er
antonio i'll be thy second
 exeunt sebastian and antonio

 like poison given to work a great time after
 now gins to bite the spirits i do beseech you
 that are of suppler joints follow them swiftly
 and hinder them from what this ecstasy
 may now provoke them to
adrian follow i pray you

 or that for which i live who once again
 i tender to thy hand all thy vexations
 were but my trials of thy love and thou
 hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven

 do not smile at me that i boast her off
 for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
 and make it halt behind her
ferdinand i do believe it
 against an oracle
prospero then as my gift and thine own acquisition
 worthily purchased take my daughter but
 if thou dost break her virginknot before
 all sanctimonious ceremonies may
 with full and holy rite be minister'd
 no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
 to make this contract grow but barren hate
 soureyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
 the union of your bed with weeds so loathly
 that you shall hate it both therefore take heed
 as hymen's lamps shall light you
ferdinand as i hope
 for quiet days fair issue and long life
 with such love as tis now the murkiest den
 the most opportune place the strong'st suggestion
 our worser genius can shall never melt
 mine honour into lust to take away
 the edge of that day's celebration

 or night kept chain'd below

 bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
 some vanity of mine art it is my promise
 and they expect it from me

 to make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves
 whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves
 being lasslorn thy poleclipt vineyard

 rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen
 summon'd me hither to this shortgrass'd green
iris a contract of true love to celebrate
 and some donation freely to estate
 on the blest lovers
ceres tell me heavenly bow
 if venus or her son as thou dost know
 do now attend the queen since they did plot
 the means that dusky dis my daughter got
 her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
 i have forsworn
iris of her society
 be not afraid i met her deity
 cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son
 dovedrawn with her here thought they to have done
 some wanton charm upon this man and maid
 whose vows are that no bedright shall be paid
 till hymen's torch be lighted but vain
 mars's hot minion is returned again

 swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows

 my present fancies
ferdinand let me live here ever
 so rare a wonder'd father and a wife
 makes this place paradise
 juno and ceres whisper and send iris on
 employment
prospero sweet now silence
 juno and ceres whisper seriously
 there's something else to do hush and be mute
 or else our spell is marr'd
iris you nymphs call'd naiads of the windring brooks
 with your sedged crowns and everharmless looks
 leave your crisp channels and on this green land
 answer your summons juno does command
 come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate
 a contract of true love be not too late
 enter certain nymphs
 you sunburnt sicklemen of august weary
 come hither from the furrow and be merry
 make holiday your ryestraw hats put on
 and these fresh nymphs encounter every one
 in country footing
 enter certain reapers properly habited they
 join with the nymphs in a graceful dance
 towards the end whereof prospero starts
 suddenly and speaks after which to a
 strange hollow and confused noise they
 heavily vanish
prospero aside i had forgot that foul conspiracy
 of the beast caliban and his confederates
 against my life the minute of their plot
 is almost come
 to the spirits
 well done avoid no more
ferdinand this is strange your father's in some passion
 that works him strongly
miranda never till this day
 saw i him touch'd with anger so distemper'd
prospero you do look my son in a moved sort
 as if you were dismay'd be cheerful sir
 our revels now are ended these our actors
 as i foretold you were all spirits and
 are melted into air into thin air
 and like the baseless fabric of this vision
 the cloudcapp'd towers the gorgeous palaces
 the solemn temples the great globe itself
 ye all which it inherit shall dissolve
 and like this insubstantial pageant faded
 leave not a rack behind we are such stuff
 as dreams are made on and our little life
 is rounded with a sleep sir i am vex'd
 bear with my weakness my brain is troubled
 be not disturb'd with my infirmity
 if you be pleased retire into my cell
 and there repose a turn or two i'll walk
 to still my beating mind
ferdinand 
 we wish your peace

ariel ay my commander when i presented ceres
 i thought to have told thee of it but i fear'd
 lest i might anger thee
prospero say again where didst thou leave these varlets
ariel i told you sir they were redhot with drinking
 so fun of valour that they smote the air
 for breathing in their faces beat the ground
 for kissing of their feet yet always bending
 towards their project then i beat my tabour
 at which like unback'd colts they prick'd
 their ears
 advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses
 as they smelt music so i charm'd their ears
 that calflike they my lowing follow'd through
 tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns
 which entered their frail shins at last i left them
 i the filthymantled pool beyond your cell
 there dancing up to the chins that the foul lake
 o'erstunk their feet
prospero this was well done my bird
 thy shape invisible retain thou still
 the trumpery in my house go bring it hither
 for stale to catch these thieves
ariel i go i go

 a noise of hunters heard enter divers spirits
 in shape of dogs and hounds and hunt them about
 prospero and ariel setting them on
prospero hey mountain hey
ariel silver i there it goes silver
prospero fury fury there tyrant there hark hark
 caliban stephano and trinculo are
 driven out
 go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
 with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews
 with aged cramps and more pinchspotted make them
 than pard or cat o mountain
ariel hark they roar
prospero let them be hunted soundly at this hour
 lie at my mercy all mine enemies
 shortly shall all my labours end and thou
 shalt have the air at freedom for a little
 follow and do me service
 exeunt
 the tempest
act v
scene i before prospero's cell
 enter prospero in his magic robes and ariel
prospero now does my project gather to a head
 my charms crack not my spirits obey and time
 goes upright with his carriage how's the day
ariel on the sixth hour at which time my lord
 you said our work should cease
prospero i did say so
 when first i raised the tempest say my spirit
 how fares the king and's followers
ariel confined together
 in the same fashion as you gave in charge
 just as you left them all prisoners sir
 in the linegrove which weatherfends your cell
 they cannot budge till your release the king
 his brother and yours abide all three distracted
 and the remainder mourning over them
 brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
 him that you term'd sir the good old lord gonzalo'
 his tears run down his beard like winter's drops
 from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works em
 that if you now beheld them your affections
 would become tender
prospero dost thou think so spirit
ariel mine would sir were i human
prospero and mine shall
 hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
 of their afflictions and shall not myself
 one of their kind that relish all as sharply
 passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art
 though with their high wrongs i am struck to the quick
 yet with my nobler reason gaitist my fury
 do i take part the rarer action is
 in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
 the sole drift of my purpose doth extend
 not a frown further go release them ariel
 my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore
 and they shall be themselves
ariel i'll fetch them sir
 exit
prospero ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves
 and ye that on the sands with printless foot
 do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him
 when he comes back you demipuppets that
 by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
 whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
 is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
 to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
 weak masters though ye be i have bedimm'd
 the noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds
 and twixt the green sea and the azured vault
 set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder
 have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak
 with his own bolt the strongbased promontory
 have i made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
 the pine and cedar graves at my command
 have waked their sleepers oped and let em forth
 by my so potent art but this rough magic
 i here abjure and when i have required
 some heavenly music which even now i do
 to work mine end upon their senses that
 this airy charm is for i'll break my staff
 bury it certain fathoms in the earth
 and deeper than did ever plummet sound
 i'll drown my book
 solemn music
 reenter ariel before then alonso with a
 frantic gesture attended by gonzalo
 sebastian and antonio in like manner
 attended by adrian and francisco they all
 enter the circle which prospero had made
 and there stand charmed which prospero
 observing speaks
 a solemn air and the best comforter
 to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
 now useless boil'd within thy skull there stand
 for you are spellstopp'd
 holy gonzalo honourable man
 mine eyes even sociable to the show of thine
 fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace
 and as the morning steals upon the night
 melting the darkness so their rising senses
 begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
 their clearer reason o good gonzalo
 my true preserver and a loyal sir
 to him you follow'st i will pay thy graces
 home both in word and deed most cruelly
 didst thou alonso use me and my daughter
 thy brother was a furtherer in the act
 thou art pinch'd fort now sebastian flesh and blood
 you brother mine that entertain'd ambition
 expell'd remorse and nature who with sebastian
 whose inward pinches therefore are most strong
 would here have kill'd your king i do forgive thee
 unnatural though thou art their understanding
 begins to swell and the approaching tide
 will shortly fill the reasonable shore
 that now lies foul and muddy not one of them
 that yet looks on me or would know me ariel
 fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell
 i will discase me and myself present
 as i was sometime milan quickly spirit
 thou shalt ere long be free
 ariel sings and helps to attire him
 where the bee sucks there suck i
 in a cowslip's bell i lie
 there i couch when owls do cry
 on the bat's back i do fly
 after summer merrily
 merrily merrily shall i live now
 under the blossom that hangs on the bough
prospero why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee
 but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so
 to the king's ship invisible as thou art
 there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
 under the hatches the master and the boatswain
 being awake enforce them to this place
 and presently i prithee
ariel i drink the air before me and return
 or ere your pulse twice beat
 exit
gonzalo all torment trouble wonder and amazement
 inhabits here some heavenly power guide us
 out of this fearful country
prospero behold sir king
 the wronged duke of milan prospero
 for more assurance that a living prince
 does now speak to thee i embrace thy body
 and to thee and thy company i bid
 a hearty welcome
alonso whether thou best he or no
 or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
 as late i have been i not know thy pulse
 beats as of flesh and blood and since i saw thee
 the affliction of my mind amends with which
 i fear a madness held me this must crave
 an if this be at all a most strange story
 thy dukedom i resign and do entreat
 thou pardon me my wrongs but how should prospero
 be living and be here
prospero first noble friend
 let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
 be measured or confined
gonzalo whether this be
 or be not i'll not swear
prospero you do yet taste
 some subtilties o the isle that will not let you
 believe things certain welcome my friends all
 aside to sebastian and antonio
 but you my brace of lords were i so minded
 i here could pluck his highness frown upon you
 and justify you traitors at this time
 i will tell no tales
sebastian aside the devil speaks in him
prospero no
 for you most wicked sir whom to call brother
 would even infect my mouth i do forgive
 thy rankest fault all of them and require
 my dukedom of thee which perforce i know
 thou must restore
alonso if thou be'st prospero
 give us particulars of thy preservation
 how thou hast met us here who three hours since
 were wreck'd upon this shore where i have lost
 how sharp the point of this remembrance is
 my dear son ferdinand
prospero i am woe for't sir
alonso irreparable is the loss and patience
 says it is past her cure
prospero i rather think
 you have not sought her help of whose soft grace
 for the like loss i have her sovereign aid
 and rest myself content
alonso you the like loss
prospero as great to me as late and supportable
 to make the dear loss have i means much weaker
 than you may call to comfort you for i
 have lost my daughter
alonso a daughter
 o heavens that they were living both in naples
 the king and queen there that they were i wish
 myself were mudded in that oozy bed
 where my son lies when did you lose your daughter
prospero in this last tempest i perceive these lords
 at this encounter do so much admire
 that they devour their reason and scarce think
 their eyes do offices of truth their words
 are natural breath but howsoe'er you have
 been justled from your senses know for certain
 that i am prospero and that very duke
 which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely
 upon this shore where you were wreck'd was landed
 to be the lord on't no more yet of this
 for tis a chronicle of day by day
 not a relation for a breakfast nor
 befitting this first meeting welcome sir
 this cell's my court here have i few attendants
 and subjects none abroad pray you look in
 my dukedom since you have given me again
 i will requite you with as good a thing
 at least bring forth a wonder to content ye
 as much as me my dukedom
 here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda
 playing at chess
miranda sweet lord you play me false
ferdinand no my dear'st love
 i would not for the world
miranda yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
 and i would call it fair play
alonso if this prove
 a vision of the island one dear son
 shall i twice lose
sebastian a most high miracle
ferdinand though the seas threaten they are merciful
 i have cursed them without cause
 kneels
alonso now all the blessings
 of a glad father compass thee about
 arise and say how thou camest here
miranda o wonder
 how many goodly creatures are there here
 how beauteous mankind is o brave new world
 that has such people in't
prospero tis new to thee
alonso what is this maid with whom thou wast at play
 your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours
 is she the goddess that hath sever'd us
 and brought us thus together
ferdinand sir she is mortal
 but by immortal providence she's mine
 i chose her when i could not ask my father
 for his advice nor thought i had one she
 is daughter to this famous duke of milan
 of whom so often i have heard renown
 but never saw before of whom i have
 received a second life and second father
 this lady makes him to me
alonso i am hers
 but o how oddly will it sound that i
 must ask my child forgiveness
prospero there sir stop
 let us not burthen our remembrance with
 a heaviness that's gone
gonzalo i have inly wept
 or should have spoke ere this look down you god
 and on this couple drop a blessed crown
 for it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
 which brought us hither
alonso i say amen gonzalo
gonzalo was milan thrust from milan that his issue
 should become kings of naples o rejoice
 beyond a common joy and set it down
 with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage
 did claribel her husband find at tunis
 and ferdinand her brother found a wife
 where he himself was lost prospero his dukedom
 in a poor isle and all of us ourselves
 when no man was his own
alonso to ferdinand and miranda give me your hands
 let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
 that doth not wish you joy
gonzalo be it so amen
 reenter ariel with the master and boatswain
 amazedly following
 o look sir look sir here is more of us
 i prophesied if a gallows were on land
 this fellow could not drown now blasphemy
 that swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore
 hast thou no mouth by land what is the news
boatswain the best news is that we have safely found
 our king and company the next our ship
 which but three glasses since we gave out split
 is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
 we first put out to sea
ariel aside to prospero sir all this service
 have i done since i went
prospero aside to ariel my tricksy spirit
alonso these are not natural events they strengthen
 from strange to stranger say how came you hither
boatswain if i did think sir i were well awake
 i'ld strive to tell you we were dead of sleep
 andhow we know notall clapp'd under hatches
 where but even now with strange and several noises
 of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
 and more diversity of sounds all horrible
 we were awaked straightway at liberty
 where we in all her trim freshly beheld
 our royal good and gallant ship our master
 capering to eye her on a trice so please you
 even in a dream were we divided from them
 and were brought moping hither
ariel aside to prospero was't well done
prospero aside to ariel bravely my diligence thou shalt be free
alonso this is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
 and there is in this business more than nature
 was ever conduct of some oracle
 must rectify our knowledge
prospero sir my liege
 do not infest your mind with beating on
 the strangeness of this business at pick'd leisure
 which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you
 which to you shall seem probable of every
 these happen'd accidents till when be cheerful
 and think of each thing well
 aside to ariel
 come hither spirit
 set caliban and his companions free
 untie the spell
 exit ariel
 how fares my gracious sir
 there are yet missing of your company
 some few odd lads that you remember not
 reenter ariel driving in caliban stephano
 and trinculo in their stolen apparel
stephano every man shift for all the rest and
 let no man take care for himself for all is
 but fortune coragio bullymonster coragio
trinculo if these be true spies which i wear in my head
 here's a goodly sight
caliban o setebos these be brave spirits indeed
 how fine my master is i am afraid
 he will chastise me
sebastian ha ha
 what things are these my lord antonio
 will money buy em
antonio very like one of them
 is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
prospero mark but the badges of these men my lords
 then say if they be true this misshapen knave
 his mother was a witch and one so strong
 that could control the moon make flows and ebbs
 and deal in her command without her power
 these three have robb'd me and this demidevil
 for he's a bastard onehad plotted with them
 to take my life two of these fellows you
 must know and own this thing of darkness
 acknowledge mine
caliban i shall be pinch'd to death
alonso is not this stephano my drunken butler
sebastian he is drunk now where had he wine
alonso and trinculo is reeling ripe where should they
 find this grand liquor that hath gilded em
 how camest thou in this pickle
trinculo i have been in such a pickle since i
 saw you last that i fear me will never out of
 my bones i shall not fear flyblowing
sebastian why how now stephano
stephano o touch me not i am not stephano but a cramp
prospero you'ld be king o the isle sirrah
stephano i should have been a sore one then
alonso this is a strange thing as e'er i look'd on
 pointing to caliban
prospero he is as disproportion'd in his manners
 as in his shape go sirrah to my cell
 take with you your companions as you look
 to have my pardon trim it handsomely
caliban ay that i will and i'll be wise hereafter
 and seek for grace what a thricedouble ass
 was i to take this drunkard for a god
 and worship this dull fool
prospero go to away
alonso hence and bestow your luggage where you found it
sebastian or stole it rather
 exeunt caliban stephano and trinculo
prospero sir i invite your highness and your train
 to my poor cell where you shall take your rest
 for this one night which part of it i'll waste
 with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it
 go quick away the story of my life
 and the particular accidents gone by
 since i came to this isle and in the morn
 i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples
 where i have hope to see the nuptial
 of these our dearbeloved solemnized
 and thence retire me to my milan where
 every third thought shall be my grave
alonso i long
 to hear the story of your life which must
 take the ear strangely
prospero i'll deliver all
 and promise you calm seas auspicious gales
 and sail so expeditious that shall catch
 your royal fleet far off
 aside to ariel
 my ariel chick
 that is thy charge then to the elements
 be free and fare thou well please you draw near
 exeunt
 the tempest
 epilogue
 spoken by prospero
 now my charms are all o'erthrown
 and what strength i have's mine own
 which is most faint now tis true
 i must be here confined by you
 or sent to naples let me not
 since i have my dukedom got
 and pardon'd the deceiver dwell
 in this bare island by your spell
 but release me from my bands
 with the help of your good hands
 gentle breath of yours my sails
 must fill or else my project fails
 which was to please now i want
 spirits to enforce art to enchant
 and my ending is despair
 unless i be relieved by prayer
 which pierces so that it assaults
 mercy itself and frees all faults
 as you from crimes would pardon'd be
 let your indulgence set me free

 troilus and cressida
 prologue
 in troy there lies the scene from isles of greece
 the princes orgulous their high blood chafed
 have to the port of athens sent their ships
 fraught with the ministers and instruments
 of cruel war sixty and nine that wore
 their crownets regal from the athenian bay
 put forth toward phrygia and their vow is made
 to ransack troy within whose strong immures
 the ravish'd helen menelaus queen
 with wanton paris sleeps and that's the quarrel
 to tenedos they come
 and the deepdrawing barks do there disgorge
 their warlike fraughtage now on dardan plains
 the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
 their brave pavilions priam's sixgated city
 dardan and tymbria helias chetas troien
 and antenorides with massy staples
 and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
 sperr up the sons of troy
 now expectation tickling skittish spirits
 on one and other side trojan and greek
 sets all on hazard and hither am i come
 a prologue arm'd but not in confidence
 of author's pen or actor's voice but suited
 in like conditions as our argument
 to tell you fair beholders that our play
 leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
 beginning in the middle starting thence away
 to what may be digested in a play
 like or find fault do as your pleasures are
 now good or bad tis but the chance of war
 troilus and cressida
act i
scene i troy before priam's palace
 enter troilus armed and pandarus
troilus call here my varlet i'll unarm again
 why should i war without the walls of troy
 that find such cruel battle here within
 each trojan that is master of his heart
 let him to field troilus alas hath none
pandarus will this gear ne'er be mended
troilus the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
 fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
 but i am weaker than a woman's tear
 tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
 less valiant than the virgin in the night
 and skilless as unpractised infancy
pandarus well i have told you enough of this for my part
 i'll not meddle nor make no further he that will
 have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the grinding but you must tarry
 the bolting
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening
troilus still have i tarried
pandarus ay to the leavening but here's yet in the word
 hereafter the kneading the making of the cake the
 heating of the oven and the baking nay you must
 stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lips
troilus patience herself what goddess e'er she be
 doth lesser blench at sufferance than i do
 at priam's royal table do i sit
 and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts
 so traitor when she comes when is she thence
pandarus well she looked yesternight fairer than ever i saw
 her look or any woman else
troilus i was about to tell theewhen my heart
 as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
 lest hector or my father should perceive me
 i have as when the sun doth light a storm
 buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
 but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
 is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
pandarus an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's
 well go tothere were no more comparison between
 the women but for my part she is my kinswoman i
 would not as they term it praise her but i would
 somebody had heard her talk yesterday as i did i
 will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit but
troilus o pandarus i tell thee pandarus
 when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd
 reply not in how many fathoms deep
 they lie indrench'd i tell thee i am mad
 in cressid's love thou answer'st she is fair'
 pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
 her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
 handlest in thy discourse o that her hand
 in whose comparison all whites are ink
 writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
 the cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
 hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tell'st me
 as true thou tell'st me when i say i love her
 but saying thus instead of oil and balm
 thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
 the knife that made it
pandarus i speak no more than truth
troilus thou dost not speak so much
pandarus faith i'll not meddle in't let her be as she is
 if she be fair tis the better for her an she be
 not she has the mends in her own hands
troilus good pandarus how now pandarus
pandarus i have had my labour for my travail illthought on of
 her and illthought on of you gone between and
 between but small thanks for my labour
troilus what art thou angry pandarus what with me
pandarus because she's kin to me therefore she's not so fair
 as helen an she were not kin to me she would be as
 fair on friday as helen is on sunday but what care
 i i care not an she were a blackamoor tis all one to me
troilus say i she is not fair
pandarus i do not care whether you do or no she's a fool to
 stay behind her father let her to the greeks and so
 i'll tell her the next time i see her for my part
 i'll meddle nor make no more i the matter
troilus pandarus
pandarus not i
troilus sweet pandarus
pandarus pray you speak no more to me i will leave all as i
 found it and there an end
 exit pandarus an alarum
troilus peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds
 fools on both sides helen must needs be fair
 when with your blood you daily paint her thus
 i cannot fight upon this argument
 it is too starved a subject for my sword
 but pandaruso gods how do you plague me
 i cannot come to cressid but by pandar
 and he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
 as she is stubbornchaste against all suit
 tell me apollo for thy daphne's love
 what cressid is what pandar and what we
 her bed is india there she lies a pearl
 between our ilium and where she resides
 let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood
 ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar
 our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
 alarum enter aeneas
aeneas how now prince troilus wherefore not afield
troilus because not there this woman's answer sorts
 for womanish it is to be from thence
 what news aeneas from the field today
aeneas that paris is returned home and hurt
troilus by whom aeneas
aeneas troilus by menelaus
troilus let paris bleed tis but a scar to scorn
 paris is gored with menelaus horn
 alarum
aeneas hark what good sport is out of town today
troilus better at home if would i might were may'
 but to the sport abroad are you bound thither
aeneas in all swift haste
troilus come go we then together
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act i
scene ii the same a street
 enter cressida and alexander
cressida who were those went by
alexander queen hecuba and helen
cressida and whither go they
alexander up to the eastern tower
 whose height commands as subject all the vale
 to see the battle hector whose patience
 is as a virtue fix'd today was moved
 he chid andromache and struck his armourer
 and like as there were husbandry in war
 before the sun rose he was harness'd light
 and to the field goes he where every flower
 did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
 in hector's wrath
cressida what was his cause of anger
alexander the noise goes this there is among the greeks
 a lord of trojan blood nephew to hector
 they call him ajax
cressida good and what of him
alexander they say he is a very man per se
 and stands alone
cressida so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs
alexander this man lady hath robbed many beasts of their
 particular additions he is as valiant as the lion
 churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man
 into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
 valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with
 discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he
 hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he
 carries some stain of it he is melancholy without
 cause and merry against the hair he hath the
 joints of every thing but everything so out of joint
 that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use
 or purblind argus all eyes and no sight
cressida but how should this man that makes
 me smile make hector angry
alexander they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and
 struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath
 ever since kept hector fasting and waking
cressida who comes here
alexander madam your uncle pandarus
 enter pandarus
cressida hector's a gallant man
alexander as may be in the world lady
pandarus what's that what's that
cressida good morrow uncle pandarus
pandarus good morrow cousin cressid what do you talk of
 good morrow alexander how do you cousin when
 were you at ilium
cressida this morning uncle
pandarus what were you talking of when i came was hector
 armed and gone ere ye came to ilium helen was not
 up was she
cressida hector was gone but helen was not up
pandarus even so hector was stirring early
cressida that were we talking of and of his anger
pandarus was he angry
cressida so he says here
pandarus true he was so i know the cause too he'll lay
 about him today i can tell them that and there's
 troilus will not come far behind him let them take
 heed of troilus i can tell them that too
cressida what is he angry too
pandarus who troilus troilus is the better man of the two
cressida o jupiter there's no comparison
pandarus what not between troilus and hector do you know a
 man if you see him
cressida ay if i ever saw him before and knew him
pandarus well i say troilus is troilus
cressida then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector
pandarus no nor hector is not troilus in some degrees
cressida tis just to each of them he is himself
pandarus himself alas poor troilus i would he were
cressida so he is
pandarus condition i had gone barefoot to india
cressida he is not hector
pandarus himself no he's not himself would a were
 himself well the gods are above time must friend
 or end well troilus well i would my heart were
 in her body no hector is not a better man than troilus
cressida excuse me
pandarus he is elder
cressida pardon me pardon me
pandarus th other's not come to't you shall tell me another
 tale when th other's come to't hector shall not
 have his wit this year
cressida he shall not need it if he have his own
pandarus nor his qualities
cressida no matter
pandarus nor his beauty
cressida twould not become him his own's better
pandarus you have no judgment niece helen
 herself swore th other day that troilus for
 a brown favourfor so tis i must confess
 not brown neither
cressida no but brown
pandarus faith to say truth brown and not brown
cressida to say the truth true and not true
pandarus she praised his complexion above paris
cressida why paris hath colour enough
pandarus so he has
cressida then troilus should have too much if she praised
 him above his complexion is higher than his he
 having colour enough and the other higher is too
 flaming a praise for a good complexion i had as
 lief helen's golden tongue had commended troilus for
 a copper nose
pandarus i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris
cressida then she's a merry greek indeed
pandarus nay i am sure she does she came to him th other
 day into the compassed windowand you know he
 has not past three or four hairs on his chin
cressida indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
 particulars therein to a total
pandarus why he is very young and yet will he within
 three pound lift as much as his brother hector
cressida is he so young a man and so old a lifter
pandarus but to prove to you that helen loves him she came
 and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin
cressida juno have mercy how came it cloven
pandarus why you know tis dimpled i think his smiling
 becomes him better than any man in all phrygia

 loves troilus
cressida troilus will stand to the proof if you'll
 prove it so
pandarus troilus why he esteems her no more than i esteem
 an addle egg
cressida if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
 head you would eat chickens i the shell
pandarus i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled
 his chin indeed she has a marvellous white hand i
 must needs confess
cressida without the rack
pandarus and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin
cressida alas poor chin many a wart is richer
pandarus but there was such laughing queen hecuba laughed
 that her eyes ran o'er
cressida with millstones
pandarus and cassandra laughed
cressida but there was more temperate fire under the pot of
 her eyes did her eyes run o'er too
pandarus and hector laughed
cressida at what was all this laughing
pandarus marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus chin
cressida an't had been a green hair i should have laughed
 too
pandarus they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer
cressida what was his answer
pandarus quoth she here's but two and fifty hairs on your
 chin and one of them is white
cressida this is her question
pandarus that's true make no question of that two and
 fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white
 hair is my father and all the rest are his sons'
 jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is paris
 my husband the forked one quoth he pluck't
 out and give it him but there was such laughing
 and helen so blushed an paris so chafed and all the
 rest so laughed that it passed
cressida so let it now for it has been while going by
pandarus well cousin i told you a thing yesterday think on't
cressida so i do
pandarus i'll be sworn tis true he will weep you an twere
 a man born in april

 heart good yonder comes paris yonder comes paris
 paris passes
 look ye yonder niece is't not a gallant man too

 hurt home today he's not hurt why this will do
 helen's heart good now ha would i could see
 troilus now you shall see troilus anon
 helenus passes

 prince of chivalry
cressida peace for shame peace
pandarus mark him note him o brave troilus look well upon
 him niece look you how his sword is bloodied and
 his helm more hacked than hector's and how he looks
 and how he goes o admirable youth he ne'er saw
 three and twenty go thy way troilus go thy way
 had i a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess
 he should take his choice o admirable man paris
 paris is dirt to him and i warrant helen to
 change would give an eye to boot
cressida here come more
 forces pass
pandarus asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran
 porridge after meat i could live and die i the
 eyes of troilus ne'er look ne'er look the eagles
 are gone crows and daws crows and daws i had
 rather be such a man as troilus than agamemnon and
 all greece
cressida there is among the greeks achilles a better man than troilus
pandarus achilles a drayman a porter a very camel
cressida well well
pandarus well well why have you any discretion have
 you any eyes do you know what a man is is not
 birth beauty good shape discourse manhood
 learning gentleness virtue youth liberality
 and such like the spice and salt that season a man
cressida ay a minced man and then to be baked with no date
 in the pie for then the man's date's out
pandarus you are such a woman one knows not at what ward you
 lie
cressida upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to
 defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine
 honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to
 defend all these and at all these wards i lie at a
 thousand watches
pandarus say one of your watches
cressida nay i'll watch you for that and that's one of the
 chiefest of them too if i cannot ward what i would
 not have hit i can watch you for telling how i took
 the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it's
 past watching
pandarus you are such another
 enter troilus's boy
boy sir my lord would instantly speak with you
pandarus where
boy at your own house there he unarms him
pandarus good boy tell him i come
 exit boy
 i doubt he be hurt fare ye well good niece
cressida adieu uncle
pandarus i'll be with you niece by and by
cressida to bring uncle
pandarus ay a token from troilus
cressida by the same token you are a bawd
 exit pandarus
 words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice
 he offers in another's enterprise
 but more in troilus thousand fold i see
 than in the glass of pandar's praise may be
 yet hold i off women are angels wooing
 things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing
 that she beloved knows nought that knows not this
 men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is
 that she was never yet that ever knew
 love got so sweet as when desire did sue
 therefore this maxim out of love i teach
 achievement is command ungain'd beseech
 then though my heart's content firm love doth bear
 nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear

scene iii the grecian camp before agamemnon's tent
 sennet enter agamemnon nestor ulysses
 menelaus and others
agamemnon princes
 what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks
 the ample proposition that hope makes
 in all designs begun on earth below
 fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters
 grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd
 as knots by the conflux of meeting sap
 infect the sound pine and divert his grain
 tortive and errant from his course of growth
 nor princes is it matter new to us
 that we come short of our suppose so far
 that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand
 sith every action that hath gone before
 whereof we have record trial did draw
 bias and thwart not answering the aim
 and that unbodied figure of the thought
 that gave't surmised shape why then you princes
 do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works
 and call them shames which are indeed nought else
 but the protractive trials of great jove
 to find persistive constancy in men
 the fineness of which metal is not found
 in fortune's love for then the bold and coward
 the wise and fool the artist and unread
 the hard and soft seem all affined and kin
 but in the wind and tempest of her frown
 distinction with a broad and powerful fan
 puffing at all winnows the light away
 and what hath mass or matter by itself
 lies rich in virtue and unmingled
nestor with due observance of thy godlike seat
 great agamemnon nestor shall apply
 thy latest words in the reproof of chance
 lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth
 how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
 upon her patient breast making their way
 with those of nobler bulk
 but let the ruffian boreas once enrage
 the gentle thetis and anon behold
 the strongribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut
 bounding between the two moist elements
 like perseus horse where's then the saucy boat
 whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
 corivall'd greatness either to harbour fled
 or made a toast for neptune even so
 doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
 in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
 the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
 than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
 makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
 and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage
 as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize
 and with an accent tuned in selfsame key
 retorts to chiding fortune
ulysses agamemnon
 thou great commander nerve and bone of greece
 heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
 in whom the tempers and the minds of all
 should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks
 besides the applause and approbation to which
 to agamemnon
 most mighty for thy place and sway
 to nestor
 and thou most reverend for thy stretch'dout life
 i give to both your speeches which were such
 as agamemnon and the hand of greece
 should hold up high in brass and such again
 as venerable nestor hatch'd in silver
 should with a bond of air strong as the axletree
 on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears
 to his experienced tongue yet let it please both
 thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak
agamemnon speak prince of ithaca and be't of less expect
 that matter needless of importless burden
 divide thy lips than we are confident
 when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws
 we shall hear music wit and oracle
ulysses troy yet upon his basis had been down
 and the great hector's sword had lack'd a master
 but for these instances
 the specialty of rule hath been neglected
 and look how many grecian tents do stand
 hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
 when that the general is not like the hive
 to whom the foragers shall all repair
 what honey is expected degree being vizarded
 the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask
 the heavens themselves the planets and this centre
 observe degree priority and place
 insisture course proportion season form
 office and custom in all line of order
 and therefore is the glorious planet sol
 in noble eminence enthroned and sphered
 amidst the other whose medicinable eye
 corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
 and posts like the commandment of a king
 sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets
 in evil mixture to disorder wander
 what plagues and what portents what mutiny
 what raging of the sea shaking of earth
 commotion in the winds frights changes horrors
 divert and crack rend and deracinate
 the unity and married calm of states
 quite from their fixure o when degree is shaked
 which is the ladder to all high designs
 then enterprise is sick how could communities
 degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
 peaceful commerce from dividable shores
 the primogenitive and due of birth
 prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
 but by degree stand in authentic place
 take but degree away untune that string
 and hark what discord follows each thing meets
 in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
 should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
 and make a sop of all this solid globe
 strength should be lord of imbecility
 and the rude son should strike his father dead
 force should be right or rather right and wrong
 between whose endless jar justice resides
 should lose their names and so should justice too
 then every thing includes itself in power
 power into will will into appetite
 and appetite an universal wolf
 so doubly seconded with will and power
 must make perforce an universal prey
 and last eat up himself great agamemnon
 this chaos when degree is suffocate
 follows the choking
 and this neglection of degree it is
 that by a pace goes backward with a purpose
 it hath to climb the general's disdain'd
 by him one step below he by the next
 that next by him beneath so every step
 exampled by the first pace that is sick
 of his superior grows to an envious fever
 of pale and bloodless emulation
 and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot
 not her own sinews to end a tale of length
 troy in our weakness stands not in her strength
nestor most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
 the fever whereof all our power is sick
agamemnon the nature of the sickness found ulysses
 what is the remedy
ulysses the great achilles whom opinion crowns
 the sinew and the forehand of our host
 having his ear full of his airy fame
 grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
 lies mocking our designs with him patroclus
 upon a lazy bed the livelong day
 breaks scurril jests
 and with ridiculous and awkward action
 which slanderer he imitation calls
 he pageants us sometime great agamemnon
 thy topless deputation he puts on
 and like a strutting player whose conceit
 lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
 to hear the wooden dialogue and sound
 twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage
 such tobepitied and o'erwrested seeming
 he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
 tis like a chime amending with terms unsquared
 which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd
 would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff
 the large achilles on his press'd bed lolling
 from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
 cries excellent tis agamemnon just
 now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard
 as he being drest to some oration'
 that's done as near as the extremest ends
 of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife
 yet god achilles still cries excellent
 tis nestor right now play him me patroclus
 arming to answer in a night alarm'
 and then forsooth the faint defects of age
 must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit
 and with a palsyfumbling on his gorget
 shake in and out the rivet and at this sport
 sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus
 or give me ribs of steel i shall split all
 in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion
 all our abilities gifts natures shapes
 severals and generals of grace exact
 achievements plots orders preventions
 excitements to the field or speech for truce
 success or loss what is or is not serves
 as stuff for these two to make paradoxes
nestor and in the imitation of these twain
 who as ulysses says opinion crowns
 with an imperial voicemany are infect
 ajax is grown selfwill'd and bears his head
 in such a rein in full as proud a place
 as broad achilles keeps his tent like him
 makes factious feasts rails on our state of war
 bold as an oracle and sets thersites
 a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
 to match us in comparisons with dirt
 to weaken and discredit our exposure
 how rank soever rounded in with danger
ulysses they tax our policy and call it cowardice
 count wisdom as no member of the war
 forestall prescience and esteem no act
 but that of hand the still and mental parts
 that do contrive how many hands shall strike
 when fitness calls them on and know by measure
 of their observant toil the enemies weight
 why this hath not a finger's dignity
 they call this bedwork mappery closetwar
 so that the ram that batters down the wall
 for the great swing and rudeness of his poise
 they place before his hand that made the engine
 or those that with the fineness of their souls
 by reason guide his execution
nestor let this be granted and achilles horse
 makes many thetis sons
 a tucket
agamemnon what trumpet look menelaus
menelaus from troy
 enter aeneas
agamemnon what would you fore our tent
aeneas is this great agamemnon's tent i pray you
agamemnon even this
aeneas may one that is a herald and a prince
 do a fair message to his kingly ears
agamemnon with surety stronger than achilles arm
 fore all the greekish heads which with one voice
 call agamemnon head and general
aeneas fair leave and large security how may
 a stranger to those most imperial looks
 know them from eyes of other mortals
agamemnon how
aeneas ay
 i ask that i might waken reverence
 and bid the cheek be ready with a blush
 modest as morning when she coldly eyes
 the youthful phoebus
 which is that god in office guiding men
 which is the high and mighty agamemnon
agamemnon this trojan scorns us or the men of troy
 are ceremonious courtiers
aeneas courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd
 as bending angels that's their fame in peace
 but when they would seem soldiers they have galls
 good arms strong joints true swords and
 jove's accord
 nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas
 peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips
 the worthiness of praise distains his worth
 if that the praised himself bring the praise forth
 but what the repining enemy commends
 that breath fame blows that praise sole sure
 transcends
agamemnon sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas
aeneas ay greek that is my name
agamemnon what's your affair i pray you
aeneas sir pardon tis for agamemnon's ears
agamemnon he hears naught privately that comes from troy
aeneas nor i from troy come not to whisper him
 i bring a trumpet to awake his ear
 to set his sense on the attentive bent
 and then to speak
agamemnon speak frankly as the wind
 it is not agamemnon's sleeping hour
 that thou shalt know trojan he is awake
 he tells thee so himself
aeneas trumpet blow loud
 send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
 and every greek of mettle let him know
 what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
 trumpet sounds
 we have great agamemnon here in troy
 a prince call'd hectorpriam is his father
 who in this dull and longcontinued truce
 is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet
 and to this purpose speak kings princes lords
 if there be one among the fair'st of greece
 that holds his honour higher than his ease
 that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
 that knows his valour and knows not his fear
 that loves his mistress more than in confession
 with truant vows to her own lips he loves
 and dare avow her beauty and her worth
 in other arms than hersto him this challenge
 hector in view of trojans and of greeks
 shall make it good or do his best to do it
 he hath a lady wiser fairer truer
 than ever greek did compass in his arms
 and will tomorrow with his trumpet call
 midway between your tents and walls of troy
 to rouse a grecian that is true in love
 if any come hector shall honour him
 if none he'll say in troy when he retires
 the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
 the splinter of a lance even so much
agamemnon this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas
 if none of them have soul in such a kind
 we left them all at home but we are soldiers
 and may that soldier a mere recreant prove
 that means not hath not or is not in love
 if then one is or hath or means to be
 that one meets hector if none else i am he
nestor tell him of nestor one that was a man
 when hector's grandsire suck'd he is old now
 but if there be not in our grecian host
 one noble man that hath one spark of fire
 to answer for his love tell him from me
 i'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
 and in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn
 and meeting him will tell him that my lady
 was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
 as may be in the world his youth in flood
 i'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood
aeneas now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth
ulysses amen
agamemnon fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand
 to our pavilion shall i lead you sir
 achilles shall have word of this intent
 so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent
 yourself shall feast with us before you go
 and find the welcome of a noble foe
 exeunt all but ulysses and nestor
ulysses nestor
nestor what says ulysses
ulysses i have a young conception in my brain
 be you my time to bring it to some shape
nestor what is't
ulysses this tis
 blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride
 that hath to this maturity blown up
 in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd
 or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
 to overbulk us all
nestor well and how
ulysses this challenge that the gallant hector sends
 however it is spread in general name
 relates in purpose only to achilles
nestor the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
 whose grossness little characters sum up
 and in the publication make no strain
 but that achilles were his brain as barren
 as banks of libyathough apollo knows
 tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment
 ay with celerity find hector's purpose
 pointing on him
ulysses and wake him to the answer think you
nestor yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose
 that can from hector bring his honour off
 if not achilles though't be a sportful combat
 yet in the trial much opinion dwells
 for here the trojans taste our dear'st repute
 with their finest palate and trust to me ulysses
 our imputation shall be oddly poised
 in this wild action for the success
 although particular shall give a scantling
 of good or bad unto the general
 and in such indexes although small pricks
 to their subsequent volumes there is seen
 the baby figure of the giant mass
 of things to come at large it is supposed
 he that meets hector issues from our choice
 and choice being mutual act of all our souls
 makes merit her election and doth boil
 as twere from us all a man distill'd
 out of our virtues who miscarrying
 what heart receives from hence the conquering part
 to steel a strong opinion to themselves
 which entertain'd limbs are his instruments
 in no less working than are swords and bows
 directive by the limbs
ulysses give pardon to my speech
 therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector
 let us like merchants show our foulest wares
 and think perchance they'll sell if not
 the lustre of the better yet to show
 shall show the better do not consent
 that ever hector and achilles meet
 for both our honour and our shame in this
 are dogg'd with two strange followers
nestor i see them not with my old eyes what are they
ulysses what glory our achilles shares from hector
 were he not proud we all should share with him
 but he already is too insolent
 and we were better parch in afric sun
 than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
 should he scape hector fair if he were foil'd
 why then we did our main opinion crush
 in taint of our best man no make a lottery
 and by device let blockish ajax draw
 the sort to fight with hector among ourselves
 give him allowance for the better man
 for that will physic the great myrmidon
 who broils in loud applause and make him fall
 his crest that prouder than blue iris bends
 if the dull brainless ajax come safe off
 we'll dress him up in voices if he fail
 yet go we under our opinion still
 that we have better men but hit or miss
 our project's life this shape of sense assumes
 ajax employ'd plucks down achilles plumes
nestor ulysses
 now i begin to relish thy advice
 and i will give a taste of it forthwith
 to agamemnon go we to him straight
 two curs shall tame each other pride alone
 must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone

 so great as our dread father in a scale
 of common ounces will you with counters sum
 the past proportion of his infinite
 and buckle in a waist most fathomless
 with spans and inches so diminutive
 as fears and reasons fie for godly shame
helenus no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
 you are so empty of them should not our father
 bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
 because your speech hath none that tells him so
troilus you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
 you fur your gloves with reason here are
 your reasons
 you know an enemy intends you harm
 you know a sword employ'd is perilous
 and reason flies the object of all harm
 who marvels then when helenus beholds
 a grecian and his sword if he do set
 the very wings of reason to his heels
 and fly like chidden mercury from jove
 or like a star disorb'd nay if we talk of reason
 let's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour
 should have harehearts would they but fat
 their thoughts
 with this cramm'd reason reason and respect
 make livers pale and lustihood deject
hector brother she is not worth what she doth cost
 the holding
troilus what is aught but as tis valued
hector but value dwells not in particular will
 it holds his estimate and dignity
 as well wherein tis precious of itself
 as in the prizer tis mad idolatry
 to make the service greater than the god
 and the will dotes that is attributive
 to what infectiously itself affects
 without some image of the affected merit
troilus i take today a wife and my election
 is led on in the conduct of my will
 my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
 two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores
 of will and judgment how may i avoid
 although my will distaste what it elected
 the wife i chose there can be no evasion
 to blench from this and to stand firm by honour
 we turn not back the silks upon the merchant
 when we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands
 we do not throw in unrespective sieve
 because we now are full it was thought meet
 paris should do some vengeance on the greeks
 your breath of full consent bellied his sails
 the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
 and did him service he touch'd the ports desired
 and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive
 he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness
 wrinkles apollo's and makes stale the morning
 why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt
 is she worth keeping why she is a pearl
 whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships
 and turn'd crown'd kings to merchants
 if you'll avouch twas wisdom paris went
 as you must needs for you all cried go go'
 if you'll confess he brought home noble prize
 as you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands
 and cried inestimable'why do you now
 the issue of your proper wisdoms rate
 and do a deed that fortune never did
 beggar the estimation which you prized
 richer than sea and land o theft most base
 that we have stol'n what we do fear to keep
 but thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n
 that in their country did them that disgrace
 we fear to warrant in our native place
cassandra within cry trojans cry
priam what noise what shriek is this
troilus tis our mad sister i do know her voice
cassandra within cry trojans
hector it is cassandra
 enter cassandra raving
cassandra cry trojans cry lend me ten thousand eyes
 and i will fill them with prophetic tears
hector peace sister peace
cassandra virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld
 soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
 add to my clamours let us pay betimes
 a moiety of that mass of moan to come
 cry trojans cry practise your eyes with tears
 troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand
 our firebrand brother paris burns us all
 cry trojans cry a helen and a woe
 cry cry troy burns or else let helen go
 exit
hector now youthful troilus do not these high strains
 of divination in our sister work
 some touches of remorse or is your blood
 so madly hot that no discourse of reason
 nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
 can qualify the same
troilus why brother hector
 we may not think the justness of each act
 such and no other than event doth form it
 nor once deject the courage of our minds
 because cassandra's mad her brainsick raptures
 cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
 which hath our several honours all engaged
 to make it gracious for my private part
 i am no more touch'd than all priam's sons
 and jove forbid there should be done amongst us
 such things as might offend the weakest spleen
 to fight for and maintain
paris else might the world convince of levity
 as well my undertakings as your counsels
 but i attest the gods your full consent
 gave wings to my propension and cut off
 all fears attending on so dire a project
 for what alas can these my single arms
 what propugnation is in one man's valour
 to stand the push and enmity of those
 this quarrel would excite yet i protest
 were i alone to pass the difficulties
 and had as ample power as i have will
 paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
 nor faint in the pursuit
priam paris you speak
 like one besotted on your sweet delights
 you have the honey still but these the gall
 so to be valiant is no praise at all
paris sir i propose not merely to myself
 the pleasures such a beauty brings with it
 but i would have the soil of her fair rape
 wiped off in honourable keeping her
 what treason were it to the ransack'd queen
 disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
 now to deliver her possession up
 on terms of base compulsion can it be
 that so degenerate a strain as this
 should once set footing in your generous bosoms
 there's not the meanest spirit on our party
 without a heart to dare or sword to draw
 when helen is defended nor none so noble
 whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
 where helen is the subject then i say
 well may we fight for her whom we know well
 the world's large spaces cannot parallel
hector paris and troilus you have both said well
 and on the cause and question now in hand
 have glozed but superficially not much
 unlike young men whom aristotle thought
 unfit to hear moral philosophy
 the reasons you allege do more conduce
 to the hot passion of distemper'd blood
 than to make up a free determination
 twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
 have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
 of any true decision nature craves
 all dues be render'd to their owners now
 what nearer debt in all humanity
 than wife is to the husband if this law
 of nature be corrupted through affection
 and that great minds of partial indulgence
 to their benumbed wills resist the same
 there is a law in each wellorder'd nation
 to curb those raging appetites that are
 most disobedient and refractory
 if helen then be wife to sparta's king
 as it is known she is these moral laws
 of nature and of nations speak aloud
 to have her back return'd thus to persist
 in doing wrong extenuates not wrong
 but makes it much more heavy hector's opinion
 is this in way of truth yet ne'ertheless
 my spritely brethren i propend to you
 in resolution to keep helen still
 for tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
 upon our joint and several dignities
troilus why there you touch'd the life of our design
 were it not glory that we more affected
 than the performance of our heaving spleens
 i would not wish a drop of trojan blood
 spent more in her defence but worthy hector
 she is a theme of honour and renown
 a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
 whose present courage may beat down our foes
 and fame in time to come canonize us
 for i presume brave hector would not lose
 so rich advantage of a promised glory
 as smiles upon the forehead of this action
 for the wide world's revenue
hector i am yours
 you valiant offspring of great priamus
 i have a roisting challenge sent amongst
 the dun and factious nobles of the greeks
 will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
 i was advertised their great general slept
 whilst emulation in the army crept
 this i presume will wake him

 enter thersites solus
thersites how now thersites what lost in the labyrinth of
 thy fury shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he
 beats me and i rail at him o worthy satisfaction
 would it were otherwise that i could beat him
 whilst he railed at me sfoot i'll learn to
 conjure and raise devils but i'll see some issue of
 my spiteful execrations then there's achilles a
 rare enginer if troy be not taken till these two
 undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of
 themselves o thou great thunderdarter of olympus
 forget that thou art jove the king of gods and
 mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy
 caduceus if ye take not that little little less
 than little wit from them that they have which
 shortarmed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
 scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
 from a spider without drawing their massy irons and
 cutting the web after this the vengeance on the
 whole camp or rather the boneache for that
 methinks is the curse dependent on those that war
 for a placket i have said my prayers and devil envy
 say amen what ho my lord achilles
 enter patroclus
patroclus who's there thersites good thersites come in and rail
thersites if i could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou
 wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but
 it is no matter thyself upon thyself the common
 curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in
 great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and
 discipline come not near thee let thy blood be thy
 direction till thy death then if she that lays thee
 out says thou art a fair corse i'll be sworn and
 sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars

thersites agamemnon is a fool achilles is a fool thersites
 is a fool and as aforesaid patroclus is a fool
achilles derive this come
thersites agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles
 achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon
 thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and
 patroclus is a fool positive
patroclus why am i a fool
thersites make that demand of the prover it suffices me thou
 art look you who comes here
achilles patroclus i'll speak with nobody
 come in with me thersites
 exit
thersites here is such patchery such juggling and such
 knavery all the argument is a cuckold and a
 whore a good quarrel to draw emulous factions

 exit
 enter agamemnon ulysses nestor diomedes and ajax
agamemnon where is achilles
patroclus within his tent but ill disposed my lord
agamemnon let it be known to him that we are here
 he shent our messengers and we lay by
 our appertainments visiting of him
 let him be told so lest perchance he think
 we dare not move the question of our place
 or know not what we are
patroclus i shall say so to him
 exit
ulysses we saw him at the opening of his tent
 he is not sick
ajax yes lionsick sick of proud heart you may call it
 melancholy if you will favour the man but by my
 head tis pride but why why let him show us the
 cause a word my lord
 takes agamemnon aside
nestor what moves ajax thus to bay at him
ulysses achilles hath inveigled his fool from him
nestor who thersites
ulysses he
nestor then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument
ulysses no you see he is his argument that has his
 argument achilles
nestor all the better their fraction is more our wish than
 their faction but it was a strong composure a fool
 could disunite
ulysses the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily
 untie here comes patroclus
 reenter patroclus
nestor no achilles with him
ulysses the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy
 his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
patroclus achilles bids me say he is much sorry
 if any thing more than your sport and pleasure
 did move your greatness and this noble state
 to call upon him he hopes it is no other
 but for your health and your digestion sake
 and afterdinner's breath
agamemnon hear you patroclus
 we are too well acquainted with these answers
 but his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn
 cannot outfly our apprehensions
 much attribute he hath and much the reason
 why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues
 not virtuously on his own part beheld
 do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
 yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
 are like to rot untasted go and tell him
 we come to speak with him and you shall not sin
 if you do say we think him overproud
 and underhonest in selfassumption greater
 than in the note of judgment and worthier
 than himself
 here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
 disguise the holy strength of their command
 and underwrite in an observing kind
 his humorous predominance yea watch
 his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
 the passage and whole carriage of this action
 rode on his tide go tell him this and add
 that if he overhold his price so much
 we'll none of him but let him like an engine
 not portable lie under this report
 bring action hither this cannot go to war
 a stirring dwarf we do allowance give
 before a sleeping giant tell him so
patroclus i shall and bring his answer presently
 exit
agamemnon in second voice we'll not be satisfied
 we come to speak with him ulysses enter you
 exit ulysses
ajax what is he more than another
agamemnon no more than what he thinks he is
ajax is he so much do you not think he thinks himself a
 better man than i am
agamemnon no question
ajax will you subscribe his thought and say he is
agamemnon no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as
 wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether
 more tractable
ajax why should a man be proud how doth pride grow i
 know not what pride is
agamemnon your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the
 fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is
 his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle
 and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours
 the deed in the praise
ajax i do hate a proud man as i hate the engendering of toads
nestor yet he loves himself is't not strange
 aside
 reenter ulysses
ulysses achilles will not to the field tomorrow
agamemnon what's his excuse
ulysses he doth rely on none
 but carries on the stream of his dispose
 without observance or respect of any
 in will peculiar and in selfadmission
agamemnon why will he not upon our fair request
 untent his person and share the air with us
ulysses things small as nothing for request's sake only
 he makes important possess'd he is with greatness
 and speaks not to himself but with a pride
 that quarrels at selfbreath imagined worth
 holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
 that twixt his mental and his active parts
 kingdom'd achilles in commotion rages
 and batters down himself what should i say
 he is so plaguy proud that the deathtokens of it
 cry no recovery'
agamemnon let ajax go to him
 dear lord go you and greet him in his tent
 tis said he holds you well and will be led
 at your request a little from himself
ulysses o agamemnon let it not be so
 we'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes
 when they go from achilles shall the proud lord
 that bastes his arrogance with his own seam
 and never suffers matter of the world
 enter his thoughts save such as do revolve
 and ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd
 of that we hold an idol more than he
 no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
 must not so stale his palm nobly acquired
 nor by my will assubjugate his merit
 as amply titled as achilles is
 by going to achilles
 that were to enlard his fat already pride
 and add more coals to cancer when he burns
 with entertaining great hyperion
 this lord go to him jupiter forbid
 and say in thunder achilles go to him'
nestor aside to diomedes o this is well he rubs the
 vein of him
diomedes aside to nestor and how his silence drinks up
 this applause
ajax if i go to him with my armed fist i'll pash him o'er the face
agamemnon o no you shall not go
ajax an a be proud with me i'll pheeze his pride
 let me go to him
ulysses not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel
ajax a paltry insolent fellow
nestor how he describes himself
ajax can he not be sociable
ulysses the raven chides blackness
ajax i'll let his humours blood
agamemnon he will be the physician that should be the patient
ajax an all men were o my mind
ulysses wit would be out of fashion
ajax a should not bear it so a should eat swords first
 shall pride carry it
nestor an twould you'ld carry half
ulysses a would have ten shares
ajax i will knead him i'll make him supple
nestor he's not yet through warm force him with praises
 pour in pour in his ambition is dry
ulysses to agamemnon my lord you feed too much on this dislike
nestor our noble general do not do so
diomedes you must prepare to fight without achilles
ulysses why tis this naming of him does him harm
 here is a manbut tis before his face
 i will be silent
nestor wherefore should you so
 he is not emulous as achilles is
ulysses know the whole world he is as valiant
ajax a whoreson dog that shall pelter thus with us
 would he were a trojan
nestor what a vice were it in ajax now
ulysses if he were proud
diomedes or covetous of praise
ulysses ay or surly borne
diomedes or strange or selfaffected
ulysses thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure
 praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck
 famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature
 thrice famed beyond all erudition
 but he that disciplined thy arms to fight
 let mars divide eternity in twain
 and give him half and for thy vigour
 bullbearing milo his addition yield
 to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom
 which like a bourn a pale a shore confines
 thy spacious and dilated parts here's nestor
 instructed by the antiquary times
 he must he is he cannot but be wise
 put pardon father nestor were your days
 as green as ajax and your brain so temper'd
 you should not have the eminence of him
 but be as ajax
ajax shall i call you father
nestor ay my good son
diomedes be ruled by him lord ajax
ulysses there is no tarrying here the hart achilles
 keeps thicket please it our great general
 to call together all his state of war
 fresh kings are come to troy tomorrow
 we must with all our main of power stand fast
 and here's a lordcome knights from east to west

pandarus o here he comes
 enter troilus
 how now how now
troilus sirrah walk off
 exit boy
pandarus have you seen my cousin
troilus no pandarus i stalk about her door
 like a strange soul upon the stygian banks
 staying for waftage o be thou my charon
 and give me swift transportance to those fields
 where i may wallow in the lilybeds
 proposed for the deserver o gentle pandarus
 from cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
 and fly with me to cressid
pandarus walk here i the orchard i'll bring her straight
 exit
troilus i am giddy expectation whirls me round
 the imaginary relish is so sweet
 that it enchants my sense what will it be
 when that the watery palate tastes indeed
 love's thrice repured nectar death i fear me
 swooning destruction or some joy too fine
 too subtlepotent tuned too sharp in sweetness
 for the capacity of my ruder powers
 i fear it much and i do fear besides
 that i shall lose distinction in my joys
 as doth a battle when they charge on heaps
 the enemy flying
 reenter pandarus
pandarus she's making her ready she'll come straight you
 must be witty now she does so blush and fetches
 her wind so short as if she were frayed with a
 sprite i'll fetch her it is the prettiest
 villain she fetches her breath as short as a
 newta'en sparrow
 exit
troilus even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
 my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse
 and all my powers do their bestowing lose
 like vassalage at unawares encountering
 the eye of majesty
 reenter pandarus with cressida
pandarus come come what need you blush shame's a baby
 here she is now swear the oaths now to her that
 you have sworn to me what are you gone again
 you must be watched ere you be made tame must you
 come your ways come your ways an you draw backward
 we'll put you i the fills why do you not speak to
 her come draw this curtain and let's see your
 picture alas the day how loath you are to offend
 daylight an twere dark you'ld close sooner
 so so rub on and kiss the mistress how now
 a kiss in feefarm build there carpenter the air
 is sweet nay you shall fight your hearts out ere
 i part you the falcon as the tercel for all the
 ducks i the river go to go to
troilus you have bereft me of all words lady
pandarus words pay no debts give her deeds but she'll
 bereave you o the deeds too if she call your
 activity in question what billing again here's
 in witness whereof the parties interchangeably'
 come in come in i'll go get a fire
 exit
cressida will you walk in my lord
troilus o cressida how often have i wished me thus
cressida wished my lord the gods granto my lord
troilus what should they grant what makes this pretty
 abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet
 lady in the fountain of our love
cressida more dregs than water if my fears have eyes
troilus fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly
cressida blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer
 footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to
 fear the worst oft cures the worse
troilus o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's
 pageant there is presented no monster
cressida nor nothing monstrous neither
troilus nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep
 seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking
 it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
 enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed
 this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will
 is infinite and the execution confined that the
 desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit
cressida they say all lovers swear more performance than they
 are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
 perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and
 discharging less than the tenth part of one they
 that have the voice of lions and the act of hares
 are they not monsters
troilus are there such such are not we praise us as we
 are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go
 bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion
 shall have a praise in present we will not name
 desert before his birth and being born his addition
 shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus
 shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst
 shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can
 speak truest not truer than troilus
cressida will you walk in my lord
 reenter pandarus
pandarus what blushing still have you not done talking yet
cressida well uncle what folly i commit i dedicate to you
pandarus i thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you
 you'll give him me be true to my lord if he
 flinch chide me for it
troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my
 firm faith
pandarus nay i'll give my word for her too our kindred
 though they be long ere they are wooed they are
 constant being won they are burs i can tell you
 they'll stick where they are thrown
cressida boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
 prince troilus i have loved you night and day
 for many weary months
troilus why was my cressid then so hard to win
cressida hard to seem won but i was won my lord
 with the first glance that everpardon me
 if i confess much you will play the tyrant
 i love you now but not till now so much
 but i might master it in faith i lie
 my thoughts were like unbridled children grown
 too headstrong for their mother see we fools
 why have i blabb'd who shall be true to us
 when we are so unsecret to ourselves
 but though i loved you well i woo'd you not
 and yet good faith i wish'd myself a man
 or that we women had men's privilege
 of speaking first sweet bid me hold my tongue
 for in this rapture i shall surely speak
 the thing i shall repent see see your silence
 cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
 my very soul of counsel stop my mouth
troilus and shall albeit sweet music issues thence
pandarus pretty i faith
cressida my lord i do beseech you pardon me
 twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss
 i am ashamed o heavens what have i done
 for this time will i take my leave my lord
troilus your leave sweet cressid
pandarus leave an you take leave till tomorrow morning
cressida pray you content you
troilus what offends you lady
cressida sir mine own company
troilus you cannot shun yourself
cressida let me go and try
 i have a kind of self resides with you
 but an unkind self that itself will leave
 to be another's fool i would be gone
 where is my wit i know not what i speak
troilus well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
cressida perchance my lord i show more craft than love
 and fell so roundly to a large confession
 to angle for your thoughts but you are wise
 or else you love not for to be wise and love
 exceeds man's might that dwells with gods above
troilus o that i thought it could be in a woman
 as if it can i will presume in you
 to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love
 to keep her constancy in plight and youth
 outliving beauty's outward with a mind
 that doth renew swifter than blood decays
 or that persuasion could but thus convince me
 that my integrity and truth to you
 might be affronted with the match and weight
 of such a winnow'd purity in love
 how were i then uplifted but alas
 i am as true as truth's simplicity
 and simpler than the infancy of truth
cressida in that i'll war with you
troilus o virtuous fight
 when right with right wars who shall be most right
 true swains in love shall in the world to come
 approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes
 full of protest of oath and big compare
 want similes truth tired with iteration
 as true as steel as plantage to the moon
 as sun to day as turtle to her mate
 as iron to adamant as earth to the centre
 yet after all comparisons of truth
 as truth's authentic author to be cited
 as true as troilus shall crown up the verse
 and sanctify the numbers
cressida prophet may you be
 if i be false or swerve a hair from truth
 when time is old and hath forgot itself
 when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy
 and blind oblivion swallow'd cities up
 and mighty states characterless are grated
 to dusty nothing yet let memory
 from false to false among false maids in love
 upbraid my falsehood when they've said as false
 as air as water wind or sandy earth
 as fox to lamb as wolf to heifer's calf
 pard to the hind or stepdame to her son'
 yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
 as false as cressid'
pandarus go to a bargain made seal it seal it i'll be the
 witness here i hold your hand here my cousin's
 if ever you prove false one to another since i have
 taken such pains to bring you together let all
 pitiful goersbetween be called to the world's end
 after my name call them all pandars let all
 constant men be troiluses all false women cressids
 and all brokersbetween pandars say amen
troilus amen
cressida amen
pandarus amen whereupon i will show you a chamber with a
 bed which bed because it shall not speak of your
 pretty encounters press it to death away
 and cupid grant all tonguetied maidens here
 bed chamber pandar to provide this gear

act iii
scene iii the grecian camp before achilles tent
 enter agamemnon ulysses diomedes nestor ajax
 menelaus and calchas
calchas now princes for the service i have done you
 the advantage of the time prompts me aloud
 to call for recompense appear it to your mind
 that through the sight i bear in things to love
 i have abandon'd troy left my possession
 incurr'd a traitor's name exposed myself
 from certain and possess'd conveniences
 to doubtful fortunes sequestering from me all
 that time acquaintance custom and condition
 made tame and most familiar to my nature
 and here to do you service am become
 as new into the world strange unacquainted
 i do beseech you as in way of taste
 to give me now a little benefit
 out of those many register'd in promise
 which you say live to come in my behalf
agamemnon what wouldst thou of us trojan make demand
calchas you have a trojan prisoner call'd antenor
 yesterday took troy holds him very dear
 oft have youoften have you thanks therefore
 desired my cressid in right great exchange
 whom troy hath still denied but this antenor
 i know is such a wrest in their affairs
 that their negotiations all must slack
 wanting his manage and they will almost
 give us a prince of blood a son of priam
 in change of him let him be sent great princes
 and he shall buy my daughter and her presence
 shall quite strike off all service i have done
 in most accepted pain
agamemnon let diomedes bear him
 and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have
 what he requests of us good diomed
 furnish you fairly for this interchange
 withal bring word if hector will tomorrow
 be answer'd in his challenge ajax is ready
diomedes this shall i undertake and tis a burden
 which i am proud to bear
 exeunt diomedes and calchas
 enter achilles and patroclus before their tent
ulysses achilles stands i the entrance of his tent
 please it our general to pass strangely by him
 as if he were forgot and princes all
 lay negligent and loose regard upon him
 i will come last tis like he'll question me
 why such unplausive eyes are bent on him
 if so i have derision medicinable
 to use between your strangeness and his pride
 which his own will shall have desire to drink
 it may be good pride hath no other glass
 to show itself but pride for supple knees
 feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees
agamemnon we'll execute your purpose and put on
 a form of strangeness as we pass along
 so do each lord and either greet him not
 or else disdainfully which shall shake him more
 than if not look'd on i will lead the way
achilles what comes the general to speak with me
 you know my mind i'll fight no more gainst troy
agamemnon what says achilles would he aught with us
nestor would you my lord aught with the general
achilles no
nestor nothing my lord
agamemnon the better
 exeunt agamemnon and nestor
achilles good day good day
menelaus how do you how do you
 exit
achilles what does the cuckold scorn me
ajax how now patroclus
achilles good morrow ajax
ajax ha
achilles good morrow
ajax ay and good next day too
 exit
achilles what mean these fellows know they not achilles
patroclus they pass by strangely they were used to bend
 to send their smiles before them to achilles
 to come as humbly as they used to creep
 to holy altars
achilles what am i poor of late
 tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune
 must fall out with men too what the declined is
 he shall as soon read in the eyes of others
 as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
 show not their mealy wings but to the summer
 and not a man for being simply man
 hath any honour but honour for those honours
 that are without him as place riches favour
 prizes of accident as oft as merit
 which when they fall as being slippery standers
 the love that lean'd on them as slippery too
 do one pluck down another and together
 die in the fall but tis not so with me
 fortune and i are friends i do enjoy
 at ample point all that i did possess
 save these men's looks who do methinks find out
 something not worth in me such rich beholding
 as they have often given here is ulysses
 i'll interrupt his reading
 how now ulysses
ulysses now great thetis son
achilles what are you reading
ulysses a strange fellow here
 writes me that man how dearly ever parted
 how much in having or without or in
 cannot make boast to have that which he hath
 nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
 as when his virtues shining upon others
 heat them and they retort that heat again
 to the first giver'
achilles this is not strange ulysses
 the beauty that is borne here in the face
 the bearer knows not but commends itself
 to others eyes nor doth the eye itself
 that most pure spirit of sense behold itself
 not going from itself but eye to eye opposed
 salutes each other with each other's form
 for speculation turns not to itself
 till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
 where it may see itself this is not strange at all
ulysses i do not strain at the position
 it is familiarbut at the author's drift
 who in his circumstance expressly proves
 that no man is the lord of any thing
 though in and of him there be much consisting
 till he communicate his parts to others
 nor doth he of himself know them for aught
 till he behold them form'd in the applause
 where they're extended who like an arch
 reverberates
 the voice again or like a gate of steel
 fronting the sun receives and renders back
 his figure and his heat i was much wrapt in this
 and apprehended here immediately
 the unknown ajax
 heavens what a man is there a very horse
 that has he knows not what nature what things there are
 most abject in regard and dear in use
 what things again most dear in the esteem
 and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow
 an act that very chance doth throw upon him
 ajax renown'd o heavens what some men do
 while some men leave to do
 how some men creep in skittish fortune's hall
 whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
 how one man eats into another's pride
 while pride is fasting in his wantonness
 to see these grecian lordswhy even already
 they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder
 as if his foot were on brave hector's breast
 and great troy shrieking
achilles i do believe it for they pass'd by me
 as misers do by beggars neither gave to me
 good word nor look what are my deeds forgot
ulysses time hath my lord a wallet at his back
 wherein he puts alms for oblivion
 a greatsized monster of ingratitudes
 those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd
 as fast as they are made forgot as soon
 as done perseverance dear my lord
 keeps honour bright to have done is to hang
 quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
 in monumental mockery take the instant way
 for honour travels in a strait so narrow
 where one but goes abreast keep then the path
 for emulation hath a thousand sons
 that one by one pursue if you give way
 or hedge aside from the direct forthright
 like to an enter'd tide they all rush by
 and leave you hindmost
 or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank
 lie there for pavement to the abject rear
 o'errun and trampled on then what they do in present
 though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours
 for time is like a fashionable host
 that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand
 and with his arms outstretch'd as he would fly
 grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles
 and farewell goes out sighing o let not
 virtue seek
 remuneration for the thing it was
 for beauty wit
 high birth vigour of bone desert in service
 love friendship charity are subjects all
 to envious and calumniating time
 one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
 that all with one consent praise newborn gawds
 though they are made and moulded of things past
 and give to dust that is a little gilt
 more laud than gilt o'erdusted
 the present eye praises the present object
 then marvel not thou great and complete man
 that all the greeks begin to worship ajax
 since things in motion sooner catch the eye
 than what not stirs the cry went once on thee
 and still it might and yet it may again
 if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
 and case thy reputation in thy tent
 whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
 made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves
 and drave great mars to faction
achilles of this my privacy
 i have strong reasons
ulysses but gainst your privacy
 the reasons are more potent and heroical
 tis known achilles that you are in love
 with one of priam's daughters
achilles ha known
ulysses is that a wonder
 the providence that's in a watchful state
 knows almost every grain of plutus gold
 finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps
 keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
 does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
 there is a mysterywith whom relation
 durst never meddlein the soul of state
 which hath an operation more divine
 than breath or pen can give expressure to
 all the commerce that you have had with troy
 as perfectly is ours as yours my lord
 and better would it fit achilles much
 to throw down hector than polyxena
 but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home
 when fame shall in our islands sound her trump
 and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing
 great hector's sister did achilles win
 but our great ajax bravely beat down him'
 farewell my lord i as your lover speak
 the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break
 exit
patroclus to this effect achilles have i moved you
 a woman impudent and mannish grown
 is not more loathed than an effeminate man
 in time of action i stand condemn'd for this
 they think my little stomach to the war
 and your great love to me restrains you thus
 sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid
 shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
 and like a dewdrop from the lion's mane
 be shook to air
achilles shall ajax fight with hector
patroclus ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
achilles i see my reputation is at stake
 my fame is shrewdly gored
patroclus o then beware
 those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
 omission to do what is necessary
 seals a commission to a blank of danger
 and danger like an ague subtly taints
 even then when we sit idly in the sun
achilles go call thersites hither sweet patroclus
 i'll send the fool to ajax and desire him
 to invite the trojan lords after the combat
 to see us here unarm'd i have a woman's longing
 an appetite that i am sick withal
 to see great hector in his weeds of peace
 to talk with him and to behold his visage
 even to my full of view
 enter thersites
 a labour saved
thersites a wonder
achilles what
thersites ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself
achilles how so
thersites he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so
 prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
 raves in saying nothing
achilles how can that be
thersites why he stalks up and down like a peacocka stride
 and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no
 arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning
 bites his lip with a politic regard as who should
 say there were wit in this head an twould out'
 and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire
 in a flint which will not show without knocking
 the man's undone forever for if hector break not his
 neck i the combat he'll break t himself in
 vainglory he knows not me i said good morrow
 ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think
 you of this man that takes me for the general he's
 grown a very landfish languageless a monster
 a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both
 sides like a leather jerkin
achilles thou must be my ambassador to him thersites
thersites who i why he'll answer nobody he professes not
 answering speaking is for beggars he wears his
 tongue in's arms i will put on his presence let
 patroclus make demands to me you shall see the
 pageant of ajax
achilles to him patroclus tell him i humbly desire the
 valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector
 to come unarmed to my tent and to procure
 safeconduct for his person of the magnanimous
 and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonoured
 captaingeneral of the grecian army agamemnon
 et cetera do this
patroclus jove bless great ajax
thersites hum
patroclus i come from the worthy achilles
thersites ha
patroclus who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent
thersites hum
patroclus and to procure safeconduct from agamemnon
thersites agamemnon
patroclus ay my lord
thersites ha
patroclus what say you to't
thersites god b wi you with all my heart
patroclus your answer sir
thersites if tomorrow be a fair day by eleven o'clock it will
 go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me
 ere he has me
patroclus your answer sir
thersites fare you well with all my heart
achilles why but he is not in this tune is he
thersites no but he's out o tune thus what music will be in
 him when hector has knocked out his brains i know
 not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo
 get his sinews to make catlings on
achilles come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight
thersites let me bear another to his horse for that's the more
 capable creature
achilles my mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd
 and i myself see not the bottom of it
 exeunt achilles and patroclus
thersites would the fountain of your mind were clear again
 that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a
 tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance

act iv
scene i troy a street
 enter from one side aeneas and servant with a
 torch from the other paris deiphobus antenor
 diomedes and others with torches
paris see ho who is that there
deiphobus it is the lord aeneas
aeneas is the prince there in person
 had i so good occasion to lie long
 as you prince paris nothing but heavenly business
 should rob my bedmate of my company
diomedes that's my mind too good morrow lord aeneas
paris a valiant greek aeneastake his hand
 witness the process of your speech wherein
 you told how diomed a whole week by days
 did haunt you in the field
aeneas health to you valiant sir
 during all question of the gentle truce
 but when i meet you arm'd as black defiance
 as heart can think or courage execute
diomedes the one and other diomed embraces
 our bloods are now in calm and so long health
 but when contention and occasion meet
 by jove i'll play the hunter for thy life
 with all my force pursuit and policy
aeneas and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
 with his face backward in humane gentleness
 welcome to troy now by anchises life
 welcome indeed by venus hand i swear
 no man alive can love in such a sort
 the thing he means to kill more excellently
diomedes we sympathize jove let aeneas live
 if to my sword his fate be not the glory
 a thousand complete courses of the sun
 but in mine emulous honour let him die
 with every joint a wound and that tomorrow
aeneas we know each other well
diomedes we do and long to know each other worse
paris this is the most despiteful gentle greeting
 the noblest hateful love that e'er i heard of
 what business lord so early
aeneas i was sent for to the king but why i know not
paris his purpose meets you twas to bring this greek
 to calchas house and there to render him
 for the enfreed antenor the fair cressid
 let's have your company or if you please
 haste there before us i constantly do think
 or rather call my thought a certain knowledge
 my brother troilus lodges there tonight
 rouse him and give him note of our approach
 with the whole quality wherefore i fear
 we shall be much unwelcome
aeneas that i assure you
 troilus had rather troy were borne to greece
 than cressid borne from troy
paris there is no help
 the bitter disposition of the time
 will have it so on lord we'll follow you
aeneas good morrow all
 exit with servant
paris and tell me noble diomed faith tell me true
 even in the soul of sound goodfellowship
 who in your thoughts merits fair helen best
 myself or menelaus
diomedes both alike
 he merits well to have her that doth seek her
 not making any scruple of her soilure
 with such a hell of pain and world of charge
 and you as well to keep her that defend her
 not palating the taste of her dishonour
 with such a costly loss of wealth and friends
 he like a puling cuckold would drink up
 the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
 you like a lecher out of whorish loins
 are pleased to breed out your inheritors
 both merits poised each weighs nor less nor more
 but he as he the heavier for a whore
paris you are too bitter to your countrywoman
diomedes she's bitter to her country hear me paris
 for every false drop in her bawdy veins
 a grecian's life hath sunk for every scruple
 of her contaminated carrion weight
 a trojan hath been slain since she could speak
 she hath not given so many good words breath
 as for her greeks and trojans suffer'd death
paris fair diomed you do as chapmen do
 dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
 but we in silence hold this virtue well
 we'll but commend what we intend to sell
 here lies our way

 comes fast upon good my brother troilus
 tell you the lady what she is to do

 enter pandarus and cressida
pandarus be moderate be moderate
cressida why tell you me of moderation
 the grief is fine full perfect that i taste
 and violenteth in a sense as strong
 as that which causeth it how can i moderate it
 if i could temporize with my affection
 or brew it to a weak and colder palate
 the like allayment could i give my grief
 my love admits no qualifying dross
 no more my grief in such a precious loss
pandarus here here here he comes
 enter troilus
 ah sweet ducks
cressida o troilus troilus
 embracing him
pandarus what a pair of spectacles is here
 let me embrace too o heart as the goodly saying is
 o heart heavy heart
 why sigh'st thou without breaking
 where he answers again
 because thou canst not ease thy smart
 by friendship nor by speaking'
 there was never a truer rhyme let us cast away
 nothing for we may live to have need of such a
 verse we see it we see it how now lambs
troilus cressid i love thee in so strain'd a purity
 that the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy
 more bright in zeal than the devotion which
 cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me
cressida have the gods envy
pandarus ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case
cressida and is it true that i must go from troy
troilus a hateful truth
cressida what and from troilus too
troilus from troy and troilus
cressida is it possible
troilus and suddenly where injury of chance
 puts back leavetaking justles roughly by
 all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
 of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
 our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows
 even in the birth of our own labouring breath
 we two that with so many thousand sighs
 did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
 with the rude brevity and discharge of one
 injurious time now with a robber's haste
 crams his rich thievery up he knows not how
 as many farewells as be stars in heaven
 with distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them
 he fumbles up into a lose adieu
 and scants us with a single famish'd kiss
 distasted with the salt of broken tears
aeneas within my lord is the lady ready
troilus hark you are call'd some say the genius so
 cries come to him that instantly must die
 bid them have patience she shall come anon
pandarus where are my tears rain to lay this wind or
 my heart will be blown up by the root
 exit
cressida i must then to the grecians
troilus no remedy
cressida a woful cressid mongst the merry greeks
 when shall we see again
troilus hear me my love be thou but true of heart
cressida i true how now what wicked deem is this
troilus nay we must use expostulation kindly
 for it is parting from us
 i speak not be thou true as fearing thee
 for i will throw my glove to death himself
 that there's no maculation in thy heart
 but be thou true say i to fashion in
 my sequent protestation be thou true
 and i will see thee
cressida o you shall be exposed my lord to dangers
 as infinite as imminent but i'll be true
troilus and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve
cressida and you this glove when shall i see you
troilus i will corrupt the grecian sentinels
 to give thee nightly visitation
 but yet be true
cressida o heavens be true again
troilus hear while i speak it love
 the grecian youths are full of quality
 they're loving well composed with gifts of nature
 flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise
 how novelty may move and parts with person
 alas a kind of godly jealousy
 which i beseech you call a virtuous sin
 makes me afeard
cressida o heavens you love me not
troilus die i a villain then
 in this i do not call your faith in question
 so mainly as my merit i cannot sing
 nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
 nor play at subtle games fair virtues all
 to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant
 but i can tell that in each grace of these
 there lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil
 that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted
cressida do you think i will
troilus no
 but something may be done that we will not
 and sometimes we are devils to ourselves
 when we will tempt the frailty of our powers
 presuming on their changeful potency

scene v the grecian camp lists set out
 enter ajax armed agamemnon achilles patroclus
 menelaus ulysses nestor and others
agamemnon here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
 anticipating time with starting courage
 give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy
 thou dreadful ajax that the appalled air
 may pierce the head of the great combatant
 and hale him hither
ajax thou trumpet there's my purse
 now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe
 blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek
 outswell the colic of puff'd aquilon
 come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood
 thou blow'st for hector
 trumpet sounds
ulysses no trumpet answers
achilles tis but early days
agamemnon is not yond diomed with calchas daughter
ulysses tis he i ken the manner of his gait
 he rises on the toe that spirit of his
 in aspiration lifts him from the earth
 enter diomedes with cressida
agamemnon is this the lady cressid
diomedes even she
agamemnon most dearly welcome to the greeks sweet lady
nestor our general doth salute you with a kiss
ulysses yet is the kindness but particular
 twere better she were kiss'd in general
nestor and very courtly counsel i'll begin
 so much for nestor
achilles i'll take what winter from your lips fair lady
 achilles bids you welcome
menelaus i had good argument for kissing once
patroclus but that's no argument for kissing now
 for this popp'd paris in his hardiment
 and parted thus you and your argument
ulysses o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
 for which we lose our heads to gild his horns
patroclus the first was menelaus kiss this mine
 patroclus kisses you
menelaus o this is trim
patroclus paris and i kiss evermore for him
menelaus i'll have my kiss sir lady by your leave
cressida in kissing do you render or receive
patroclus both take and give
cressida i'll make my match to live
 the kiss you take is better than you give
 therefore no kiss
menelaus i'll give you boot i'll give you three for one
cressida you're an odd man give even or give none
menelaus an odd man lady every man is odd
cressida no paris is not for you know tis true
 that you are odd and he is even with you
menelaus you fillip me o the head
cressida no i'll be sworn
ulysses it were no match your nail against his horn
 may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you
cressida you may
ulysses i do desire it
cressida why beg then
ulysses why then for venus sake give me a kiss
 when helen is a maid again and his
cressida i am your debtor claim it when tis due
ulysses never's my day and then a kiss of you
diomedes lady a word i'll bring you to your father
 exit with cressida
nestor a woman of quick sense
ulysses fie fie upon her
 there's language in her eye her cheek her lip
 nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out
 at every joint and motive of her body
 o these encounterers so glib of tongue
 that give accosting welcome ere it comes
 and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
 to every ticklish reader set them down
 for sluttish spoils of opportunity
 and daughters of the game
 trumpet within
all the trojans trumpet
agamemnon yonder comes the troop
 enter hector armed aeneas troilus and other
 trojans with attendants
aeneas hail all you state of greece what shall be done
 to him that victory commands or do you purpose
 a victor shall be known will you the knights
 shall to the edge of all extremity
 pursue each other or shall be divided
 by any voice or order of the field
 hector bade ask
agamemnon which way would hector have it
aeneas he cares not he'll obey conditions
achilles tis done like hector but securely done
 a little proudly and great deal misprizing
 the knight opposed
aeneas if not achilles sir
 what is your name
achilles if not achilles nothing
aeneas therefore achilles but whate'er know this
 in the extremity of great and little
 valour and pride excel themselves in hector
 the one almost as infinite as all
 the other blank as nothing weigh him well
 and that which looks like pride is courtesy
 this ajax is half made of hector's blood
 in love whereof half hector stays at home
 half heart half hand half hector comes to seek
 this blended knight half trojan and half greek
achilles a maiden battle then o i perceive you
 reenter diomedes
agamemnon here is sir diomed go gentle knight
 stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas
 consent upon the order of their fight
 so be it either to the uttermost
 or else a breath the combatants being kin
 half stints their strife before their strokes begin
 ajax and hector enter the lists
ulysses they are opposed already
agamemnon what trojan is that same that looks so heavy
ulysses the youngest son of priam a true knight
 not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
 speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
 not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd
 his heart and hand both open and both free
 for what he has he gives what thinks he shows
 yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
 nor dignifies an impure thought with breath
 manly as hector but more dangerous
 for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
 to tender objects but he in heat of action
 is more vindicative than jealous love
 they call him troilus and on him erect
 a second hope as fairly built as hector
 thus says aeneas one that knows the youth
 even to his inches and with private soul
 did in great ilion thus translate him to me
 alarum hector and ajax fight
agamemnon they are in action
nestor now ajax hold thine own
troilus hector thou sleep'st
 awake thee
agamemnon his blows are well disposed there ajax
diomedes you must no more
 trumpets cease
aeneas princes enough so please you
ajax i am not warm yet let us fight again
diomedes as hector pleases
hector why then will i no more
 thou art great lord my father's sister's son
 a cousingerman to great priam's seed
 the obligation of our blood forbids
 a gory emulation twixt us twain
 were thy commixtion greek and trojan so
 that thou couldst say this hand is grecian all
 and this is trojan the sinews of this leg
 all greek and this all troy my mother's blood
 runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
 bounds in my father's by jove multipotent
 thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member
 wherein my sword had not impressure made
 of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay
 that any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother
 my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
 be drain'd let me embrace thee ajax
 by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
 hector would have them fall upon him thus
 cousin all honour to thee
ajax i thank thee hector
 thou art too gentle and too free a man
 i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
 a great addition earned in thy death
hector not neoptolemus so mirable
 on whose bright crest fame with her loud'st oyes
 cries this is he could promise to himself
 a thought of added honour torn from hector
aeneas there is expectance here from both the sides
 what further you will do
hector we'll answer it
 the issue is embracement ajax farewell
ajax if i might in entreaties find success
 as seld i have the chancei would desire
 my famous cousin to our grecian tents
diomedes tis agamemnon's wish and great achilles
 doth long to see unarm'd the valiant hector
hector aeneas call my brother troilus to me
 and signify this loving interview
 to the expecters of our trojan part
 desire them home give me thy hand my cousin
 i will go eat with thee and see your knights
ajax great agamemnon comes to meet us here
hector the worthiest of them tell me name by name
 but for achilles mine own searching eyes
 shall find him by his large and portly size
agamemnon worthy of arms as welcome as to one
 that would be rid of such an enemy
 but that's no welcome understand more clear
 what's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
 and formless ruin of oblivion
 but in this extant moment faith and troth
 strain'd purely from all hollow biasdrawing
 bids thee with most divine integrity
 from heart of very heart great hector welcome
hector i thank thee most imperious agamemnon
agamemnon to troilus my wellfamed lord of troy no
 less to you
menelaus let me confirm my princely brother's greeting
 you brace of warlike brothers welcome hither
hector who must we answer
aeneas the noble menelaus
hector o you my lord by mars his gauntlet thanks
 mock not that i affect the untraded oath
 your quondam wife swears still by venus glove
 she's well but bade me not commend her to you
menelaus name her not now sir she's a deadly theme
hector o pardon i offend
nestor i have thou gallant trojan seen thee oft
 labouring for destiny make cruel way
 through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee
 as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed
 despising many forfeits and subduements
 when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i the air
 not letting it decline on the declined
 that i have said to some my standers by
 lo jupiter is yonder dealing life'
 and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath
 when that a ring of greeks have hemm'd thee in
 like an olympian wrestling this have i seen
 but this thy countenance still lock'd in steel
 i never saw till now i knew thy grandsire
 and once fought with him he was a soldier good
 but by great mars the captain of us all
 never saw like thee let an old man embrace thee
 and worthy warrior welcome to our tents
aeneas tis the old nestor
hector let me embrace thee good old chronicle
 that hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time
 most reverend nestor i am glad to clasp thee
nestor i would my arms could match thee in contention
 as they contend with thee in courtesy
hector i would they could
nestor ha
 by this white beard i'ld fight with thee tomorrow
 well welcome welcome i have seen the time
ulysses i wonder now how yonder city stands
 when we have here her base and pillar by us
hector i know your favour lord ulysses well
 ah sir there's many a greek and trojan dead
 since first i saw yourself and diomed
 in ilion on your greekish embassy
ulysses sir i foretold you then what would ensue
 my prophecy is but half his journey yet
 for yonder walls that pertly front your town
 yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
 must kiss their own feet
hector i must not believe you
 there they stand yet and modestly i think
 the fall of every phrygian stone will cost
 a drop of grecian blood the end crowns all
 and that old common arbitrator time
 will one day end it
ulysses so to him we leave it
 most gentle and most valiant hector welcome
 after the general i beseech you next
 to feast with me and see me at my tent
achilles i shall forestall thee lord ulysses thou
 now hector i have fed mine eyes on thee
 i have with exact view perused thee hector
 and quoted joint by joint
hector is this achilles
achilles i am achilles
hector stand fair i pray thee let me look on thee
achilles behold thy fill
hector nay i have done already
achilles thou art too brief i will the second time
 as i would buy thee view thee limb by limb
hector o like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er
 but there's more in me than thou understand'st
 why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
achilles tell me you heavens in which part of his body
 shall i destroy him whether there or there or there
 that i may give the local wound a name
 and make distinct the very breach whereout
 hector's great spirit flew answer me heavens
hector it would discredit the blest gods proud man
 to answer such a question stand again
 think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
 as to prenominate in nice conjecture
 where thou wilt hit me dead
achilles i tell thee yea
hector wert thou an oracle to tell me so
 i'd not believe thee henceforth guard thee well
 for i'll not kill thee there nor there nor there
 but by the forge that stithied mars his helm
 i'll kill thee every where yea o'er and o'er
 you wisest grecians pardon me this brag
 his insolence draws folly from my lips
 but i'll endeavour deeds to match these words
 or may i never
ajax do not chafe thee cousin
 and you achilles let these threats alone
 till accident or purpose bring you to't
 you may have every day enough of hector
 if you have stomach the general state i fear
 can scarce entreat you to be odd with him
hector i pray you let us see you in the field
 we have had pelting wars since you refused
 the grecians cause
achilles dost thou entreat me hector
 tomorrow do i meet thee fell as death
 tonight all friends
hector thy hand upon that match
agamemnon first all you peers of greece go to my tent
 there in the full convive we afterwards
 as hector's leisure and your bounties shall
 concur together severally entreat him
 beat loud the tabourines let the trumpets blow
 that this great soldier may his welcome know
 exeunt all except troilus and ulysses
troilus my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you
 in what place of the field doth calchas keep
ulysses at menelaus tent most princely troilus
 there diomed doth feast with him tonight
 who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth
 but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
 on the fair cressid
troilus shall sweet lord be bound to you so much
 after we part from agamemnon's tent
 to bring me thither
ulysses you shall command me sir
 as gentle tell me of what honour was
 this cressida in troy had she no lover there
 that wails her absence
troilus o sir to such as boasting show their scars
 a mock is due will you walk on my lord
 she was beloved she loved she is and doth
 but still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth

thersites now she sharpens well said whetstone
diomedes i shall have it
cressida what this

 thy master now lies thinking in his bed
 of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove

diomedes farewell till then
cressida good night i prithee come
 exit diomedes
 troilus farewell one eye yet looks on thee
 but with my heart the other eye doth see
 ah poor our sex this fault in us i find
 the error of our eye directs our mind
 what error leads must err o then conclude
 minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude
 exit
thersites a proof of strength she could not publish more
 unless she said  my mind is now turn'd whore'
ulysses all's done my lord
troilus it is
ulysses why stay we then
troilus to make a recordation to my soul
 of every syllable that here was spoke
 but if i tell how these two did coact
 shall i not lie in publishing a truth
 sith yet there is a credence in my heart
 an esperance so obstinately strong
 that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears
 as if those organs had deceptious functions
 created only to calumniate
 was cressid here
ulysses i cannot conjure trojan
troilus she was not sure
ulysses most sure she was
troilus why my negation hath no taste of madness
ulysses nor mine my lord cressid was here but now
troilus let it not be believed for womanhood
 think we had mothers do not give advantage
 to stubborn critics apt without a theme
 for depravation to square the general sex
 by cressid's rule rather think this not cressid
ulysses what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers
troilus nothing at all unless that this were she
thersites will he swagger himself out on's own eyes
troilus this she no this is diomed's cressida
 if beauty have a soul this is not she
 if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies
 if sanctimony be the gods delight
 if there be rule in unity itself
 this is not she o madness of discourse
 that cause sets up with and against itself
 bifold authority where reason can revolt
 without perdition and loss assume all reason
 without revolt this is and is not cressid
 within my soul there doth conduce a fight
 of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
 divides more wider than the sky and earth
 and yet the spacious breadth of this division
 admits no orifex for a point as subtle
 as ariachne's broken woof to enter
 instance o instance strong as pluto's gates
 cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
 instance o instance strong as heaven itself
 the bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolved and loosed
 and with another knot fivefingertied
 the fractions of her faith orts of her love
 the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics
 of her o'ereaten faith are bound to diomed
ulysses may worthy troilus be half attach'd
 with that which here his passion doth express
troilus ay greek and that shall be divulged well
 in characters as red as mars his heart
 inflamed with venus never did young man fancy
 with so eternal and so fix'd a soul
 hark greek as much as i do cressid love
 so much by weight hate i her diomed
 that sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm
 were it a casque composed by vulcan's skill
 my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout
 which shipmen do the hurricano call
 constringed in mass by the almighty sun
 shall dizzy with more clamour neptune's ear
 in his descent than shall my prompted sword
 falling on diomed
thersites he'll tickle it for his concupy
troilus o cressid o false cressid false false false
 let all untruths stand by thy stained name
 and they'll seem glorious
ulysses o contain yourself
 your passion draws ears hither
 enter aeneas
aeneas i have been seeking you this hour my lord
 hector by this is arming him in troy
 ajax your guard stays to conduct you home
troilus have with you prince my courteous lord adieu
 farewell revolted fair and diomed
 stand fast and wear a castle on thy head
ulysses i'll bring you to the gates
troilus accept distracted thanks
 exeunt troilus aeneas and ulysses
thersites would i could meet that rogue diomed i would
 croak like a raven i would bode i would bode
 patroclus will give me any thing for the
 intelligence of this whore the parrot will not

cassandra o tis true
hector ho bid my trumpet sound
cassandra no notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother
hector be gone i say the gods have heard me swear
cassandra the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
 they are polluted offerings more abhorr'd
 than spotted livers in the sacrifice
andromache o be persuaded do not count it holy
 to hurt by being just it is as lawful
 for we would give much to use violent thefts
 and rob in the behalf of charity
cassandra it is the purpose that makes strong the vow
 but vows to every purpose must not hold
 unarm sweet hector
hector hold you still i say
 mine honour keeps the weather of my fate
 lie every man holds dear but the brave man
 holds honour far more preciousdear than life

troilus brother you have a vice of mercy in you
 which better fits a lion than a man
hector what vice is that good troilus chide me for it
troilus when many times the captive grecian falls
 even in the fan and wind of your fair sword
 you bid them rise and live
hector o'tis fair play
troilus fool's play by heaven hector
hector how now how now
troilus for the love of all the gods
 let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers
 and when we have our armours buckled on
 the venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords
 spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth
hector fie savage fie
troilus hector then tis wars
hector troilus i would not have you fight today
troilus who should withhold me
 not fate obedience nor the hand of mars
 beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire

 opposed to hinder me should stop my way

 am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
 to tell thee that this day is ominous
 therefore come back
hector aeneas is afield
 and i do stand engaged to many greeks
 even in the faith of valour to appear
 this morning to them
priam ay but thou shalt not go
hector i must not break my faith
 you know me dutiful therefore dear sir
 let me not shame respect but give me leave
 to take that course by your consent and voice
 which you do here forbid me royal priam

 assure yourself after our ship did split
 when you and those poor number saved with you
 hung on our driving boat i saw your brother
 most provident in peril bind himself
 courage and hope both teaching him the practise
 to a strong mast that lived upon the sea
 where like arion on the dolphin's back
 i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
 so long as i could see

captain a virtuous maid the daughter of a count
 that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her
 in the protection of his son her brother
 who shortly also died for whose dear love
 they say she hath abjured the company
 and sight of men
viola o that i served that lady
 and might not be delivered to the world
 till i had made mine own occasion mellow
 what my estate is
captain that were hard to compass
 because she will admit no kind of suit
 no not the duke's
viola there is a fair behavior in thee captain
 and though that nature with a beauteous wall
 doth oft close in pollution yet of thee
 i will believe thou hast a mind that suits
 with this thy fair and outward character
 i prithee and i'll pay thee bounteously
 conceal me what i am and be my aid
 for such disguise as haply shall become
 the form of my intent i'll serve this duke
 thou shall present me as an eunuch to him
 it may be worth thy pains for i can sing
 and speak to him in many sorts of music
 that will allow me very worth his service
 what else may hap to time i will commit
 only shape thou thy silence to my wit
captain be you his eunuch and your mute i'll be
 when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see

olivia your lord does know my mind i cannot love him
 yet i suppose him virtuous know him noble
 of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
 in voices well divulged free learn'd and valiant
 and in dimension and the shape of nature
 a gracious person but yet i cannot love him
 he might have took his answer long ago
viola if i did love you in my master's flame
 with such a suffering such a deadly life
 in your denial i would find no sense
 i would not understand it
olivia why what would you
viola make me a willow cabin at your gate
 and call upon my soul within the house
 write loyal cantons of contemned love
 and sing them loud even in the dead of night
 halloo your name to the reverberate hills
 and make the babbling gossip of the air
 cry out olivia o you should not rest
 between the elements of air and earth
 but you should pity me
olivia you might do much

 leave that i may bear my evils alone it were a bad
 recompense for your love to lay any of them on you
antonio let me yet know of you whither you are bound
sebastian no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere
 extravagancy but i perceive in you so excellent a
 touch of modesty that you will not extort from me
 what i am willing to keep in therefore it charges
 me in manners the rather to express myself you
 must know of me then antonio my name is sebastian
 which i called roderigo my father was that
 sebastian of messaline whom i know you have heard
 of he left behind him myself and a sister both
 born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased
 would we had so ended but you sir altered that
 for some hour before you took me from the breach of
 the sea was my sister drowned
antonio alas the day
sebastian a lady sir though it was said she much resembled
 me was yet of many accounted beautiful but
 though i could not with such estimable wonder
 overfar believe that yet thus far i will boldly
 publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but
 call fair she is drowned already sir with salt
 water though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more
antonio pardon me sir your bad entertainment
sebastian o good antonio forgive me your trouble
antonio if you will not murder me for my love let me be
 your servant
sebastian if you will not undo what you have done that is
 kill him whom you have recovered desire it not
 fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness
 and i am yet so near the manners of my mother that
 upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
 tales of me i am bound to the count orsino's court farewell

 swarths the best persuaded of himself so
 crammed as he thinks with excellencies that it is
 his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
 him and on that vice in him will my revenge find
 notable cause to work
sir toby belch what wilt thou do

 love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape
 of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure
 of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find
 himself most feelingly personated i can write very
 like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we
 can hardly make distinction of our hands

 twelfth night
act ii
scene iv duke orsino's palace
 enter duke orsino viola curio and others
duke orsino give me some music now good morrow friends
 now good cesario but that piece of song
 that old and antique song we heard last night
 methought it did relieve my passion much
 more than light airs and recollected terms
 of these most brisk and giddypaced times
 come but one verse
curio he is not here so please your lordship that should sing it
duke orsino who was it
curio feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady
 olivia's father took much delight in he is about the house
duke orsino seek him out and play the tune the while
 exit curio music plays
 come hither boy if ever thou shalt love
 in the sweet pangs of it remember me
 for such as i am all true lovers are
 unstaid and skittish in all motions else
 save in the constant image of the creature
 that is beloved how dost thou like this tune
viola it gives a very echo to the seat
 where love is throned
duke orsino thou dost speak masterly
 my life upon't young though thou art thine eye
 hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves
 hath it not boy
viola a little by your favour
duke orsino what kind of woman is't
viola of your complexion
duke orsino she is not worth thee then what years i faith
viola about your years my lord
duke orsino too old by heaven let still the woman take
 an elder than herself so wears she to him
 so sways she level in her husband's heart
 for boy however we do praise ourselves
 our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
 more longing wavering sooner lost and worn
 than women's are
viola i think it well my lord
duke orsino then let thy love be younger than thyself
 or thy affection cannot hold the bent
 for women are as roses whose fair flower
 being once display'd doth fall that very hour
viola and so they are alas that they are so
 to die even when they to perfection grow
 reenter curio and clown
duke orsino o fellow come the song we had last night
 mark it cesario it is old and plain
 the spinsters and the knitters in the sun
 and the free maids that weave their thread with bones
 do use to chant it it is silly sooth
 and dallies with the innocence of love
 like the old age
clown are you ready sir
duke orsino ay prithee sing
 music
 
 song
clown come away come away death
 and in sad cypress let me be laid
 fly away fly away breath
 i am slain by a fair cruel maid
 my shroud of white stuck all with yew
 o prepare it
 my part of death no one so true
 did share it
 not a flower not a flower sweet
 on my black coffin let there be strown
 not a friend not a friend greet
 my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
 a thousand thousand sighs to save
 lay me o where
 sad true lover never find my grave
 to weep there
duke orsino there's for thy pains
clown no pains sir i take pleasure in singing sir
duke orsino i'll pay thy pleasure then
clown truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another
duke orsino give me now leave to leave thee
clown now the melancholy god protect thee and the
 tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for
 thy mind is a very opal i would have men of such
 constancy put to sea that their business might be
 every thing and their intent every where for that's
 it that always makes a good voyage of nothing farewell
 exit
duke orsino let all the rest give place
 curio and attendants retire
 once more cesario
 get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
 tell her my love more noble than the world
 prizes not quantity of dirty lands
 the parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her
 tell her i hold as giddily as fortune
 but tis that miracle and queen of gems
 that nature pranks her in attracts my soul
viola but if she cannot love you sir
duke orsino i cannot be so answer'd
viola sooth but you must
 say that some lady as perhaps there is
 hath for your love a great a pang of heart
 as you have for olivia you cannot love her
 you tell her so must she not then be answer'd
duke orsino there is no woman's sides
 can bide the beating of so strong a passion
 as love doth give my heart no woman's heart
 so big to hold so much they lack retention
 alas their love may be call'd appetite
 no motion of the liver but the palate
 that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
 but mine is all as hungry as the sea
 and can digest as much make no compare
 between that love a woman can bear me
 and that i owe olivia
viola ay but i know
duke orsino what dost thou know
viola too well what love women to men may owe
 in faith they are as true of heart as we
 my father had a daughter loved a man
 as it might be perhaps were i a woman
 i should your lordship
duke orsino and what's her history
viola a blank my lord she never told her love
 but let concealment like a worm i the bud
 feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought
 and with a green and yellow melancholy
 she sat like patience on a monument
 smiling at grief was not this love indeed
 we men may say more swear more but indeed
 our shows are more than will for still we prove
 much in our vows but little in our love
duke orsino but died thy sister of her love my boy
viola i am all the daughters of my father's house
 and all the brothers too and yet i know not
 sir shall i to this lady
duke orsino ay that's the theme
 to her in haste give her this jewel say
 my love can give no place bide no denay

malvolio tis but fortune all is fortune maria once told

 of my complexion besides she uses me with a more
 exalted respect than any one else that follows her

malvolio calling my officers about me in my branched velvet
 gown having come from a daybed where i have left
 olivia sleeping
sir toby belch fire and brimstone

 demure travel of regard telling them i know my
 place as i would they should do theirs to for my
 kinsman toby

 out for him i frown the while and perchance wind
 up watch or play with mysome rich jewel toby
 approaches courtesies there to me

fabian though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace
malvolio i extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar
 smile with an austere regard of control
sir toby belch and does not toby take you a blow o the lips then
malvolio saying cousin toby my fortunes having cast me on
 your niece give me this prerogative of speech'
sir toby belch what what
malvolio you must amend your drunkenness'

 very c's her u's and her t's and thus makes she her
 great p's it is in contempt of question her hand

malvolio m o a i doth sway my life nay but first let
 me see let me see let me see
fabian what dish o poison has she dressed him
sir toby belch and with what wing the staniel cheques at it
malvolio i may command where i adore why she may command
 me i serve her she is my lady why this is
 evident to any formal capacity there is no
 obstruction in this and the endwhat should
 that alphabetical position portend if i could make
 that resemble something in mesoftly m o a
 i
sir toby belch o ay make up that he is now at a cold scent
fabian sowter will cry upon't for all this though it be as
 rank as a fox
malvolio mmalvolio mwhy that begins my name
fabian did not i say he would work it out the cur is
 excellent at faults
malvolio mbut then there is no consonancy in the sequel
 that suffers under probation a should follow but o does
fabian and o shall end i hope
sir toby belch ay or i'll cudgel him and make him cry o
malvolio and then i comes behind
fabian ay an you had any eye behind you you might see
 more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
 you
malvolio m o a i this simulation is not as the former and
 yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for
 every one of these letters are in my name soft
 here follows prose
 reads
 if this fall into thy hand revolve in my stars i
 am above thee but be not afraid of greatness some
 are born great some achieve greatness and some
 have greatness thrust upon em thy fates open
 their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them
 and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be
 cast thy humble slough and appear fresh be
 opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let
 thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into
 the trick of singularity she thus advises thee
 that sighs for thee remember who commended thy
 yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever
 crossgartered i say remember go to thou art
 made if thou desirest to be so if not let me see
 thee a steward still the fellow of servants and
 not worthy to touch fortune's fingers farewell
 she that would alter services with thee
 the fortunateunhappy'
 daylight and champaign discovers not more this is
 open i will be proud i will read politic authors
 i will baffle sir toby i will wash off gross
 acquaintance i will be pointdevise the very man
 i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade
 me for every reason excites to this that my lady
 loves me she did commend my yellow stockings of
 late she did praise my leg being crossgartered
 and in this she manifests herself to my love and
 with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
 of her liking i thank my stars i am happy i will
 be strange stout in yellow stockings and
 crossgartered even with the swiftness of putting
 on jove and my stars be praised here is yet a
 postscript
 reads
 thou canst not choose but know who i am if thou
 entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling
 thy smiles become thee well therefore in my
 presence still smile dear my sweet i prithee'
 jove i thank thee i will smile i will do
 everything that thou wilt have me
 exit
fabian i will not give my part of this sport for a pension
 of thousands to be paid from the sophy
sir toby belch i could marry this wench for this device
sir andrew so could i too
sir toby belch and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
sir andrew nor i neither
fabian here comes my noble gullcatcher

 the image of it leaves him he must run mad
maria nay but say true does it work upon him
sir toby belch like aquavitae with a midwife
maria if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark
 his first approach before my lady he will come to
 her in yellow stockings and tis a colour she
 abhors and crossgartered a fashion she detests
 and he will smile upon her which will now be so
 unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a
 melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him
 into a notable contempt if you will see it follow
 me
sir toby belch to the gates of tartar thou most excellent devil of wit
sir andrew i'll make one too

act iii
scene i olivia's garden
 enter viola and clown with a tabour
viola save thee friend and thy music dost thou live by
 thy tabour
clown no sir i live by the church
viola art thou a churchman
clown no such matter sir i do live by the church for
 i do live at my house and my house doth stand by
 the church
viola so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a
 beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy
 tabour if thy tabour stand by the church
clown you have said sir to see this age a sentence is
 but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the
 wrong side may be turned outward
viola nay that's certain they that dally nicely with
 words may quickly make them wanton
clown i would therefore my sister had had no name sir
viola why man
clown why sir her name's a word and to dally with that
 word might make my sister wanton but indeed words
 are very rascals since bonds disgraced them
viola thy reason man
clown troth sir i can yield you none without words and
 words are grown so false i am loath to prove
 reason with them
viola i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing
clown not so sir i do care for something but in my
 conscience sir i do not care for you if that be
 to care for nothing sir i would it would make you invisible
viola art not thou the lady olivia's fool
clown no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly she
 will keep no fool sir till she be married and
 fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
 herrings the husband's the bigger i am indeed not
 her fool but her corrupter of words
viola i saw thee late at the count orsino's
clown foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun
 it shines every where i would be sorry sir but
 the fool should be as oft with your master as with
 my mistress i think i saw your wisdom there
viola nay an thou pass upon me i'll no more with thee
 hold there's expenses for thee
clown now jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard
viola by my troth i'll tell thee i am almost sick for
 one
 aside
 though i would not have it grow on my chin is thy
 lady within
clown would not a pair of these have bred sir
viola yes being kept together and put to use
clown i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring
 a cressida to this troilus
viola i understand you sir tis well begged
clown the matter i hope is not great sir begging but
 a beggar cressida was a beggar my lady is
 within sir i will construe to them whence you
 come who you are and what you would are out of my
 welkin i might say element but the word is overworn
 exit
viola this fellow is wise enough to play the fool
 and to do that well craves a kind of wit
 he must observe their mood on whom he jests
 the quality of persons and the time
 and like the haggard cheque at every feather
 that comes before his eye this is a practise
 as full of labour as a wise man's art
 for folly that he wisely shows is fit
 but wise men follyfall'n quite taint their wit
 enter sir toby belch and sir andrew

viola and you sir

 would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me
viola madam i come to whet your gentle thoughts
 on his behalf
olivia o by your leave i pray you
 i bade you never speak again of him
 but would you undertake another suit
 i had rather hear you to solicit that
 than music from the spheres
viola dear lady
olivia give me leave beseech you i did send
 after the last enchantment you did here
 a ring in chase of you so did i abuse
 myself my servant and i fear me you
 under your hard construction must i sit
 to force that on you in a shameful cunning
 which you knew none of yours what might you think
 have you not set mine honour at the stake
 and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
 that tyrannous heart can think to one of your receiving
 enough is shown a cypress not a bosom
 hideth my heart so let me hear you speak
viola i pity you
olivia that's a degree to love
viola no not a grize for tis a vulgar proof
 that very oft we pity enemies
olivia why then methinks tis time to smile again
 o world how apt the poor are to be proud
 if one should be a prey how much the better
 to fall before the lion than the wolf
 clock strikes
 the clock upbraids me with the waste of time
 be not afraid good youth i will not have you
 and yet when wit and youth is come to harvest
 your were is alike to reap a proper man
 there lies your way due west

viola that you do think you are not what you are
olivia if i think so i think the same of you
viola then think you right i am not what i am
olivia i would you were as i would have you be
viola would it be better madam than i am
 i wish it might for now i am your fool
olivia o what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
 in the contempt and anger of his lip
 a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
 than love that would seem hid love's night is noon
 cesario by the roses of the spring
 by maidhood honour truth and every thing
 i love thee so that maugre all thy pride
 nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
 do not extort thy reasons from this clause
 for that i woo thou therefore hast no cause
 but rather reason thus with reason fetter
 love sought is good but given unsought better
viola by innocence i swear and by my youth
 i have one heart one bosom and one truth
 and that no woman has nor never none
 shall mistress be of it save i alone
 and so adieu good madam never more
 will i my master's tears to you deplore
olivia yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move
 that heart which now abhors to like his love

sir andrew as plain as i see you now
fabian this was a great argument of love in her toward you
sir andrew slight will you make an ass o me
fabian i will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of
 judgment and reason
sir toby belch and they have been grandjurymen since before noah
 was a sailor
fabian she did show favour to the youth in your sight only
 to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to
 put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
 you should then have accosted her and with some
 excellent jests firenew from the mint you should
 have banged the youth into dumbness this was
 looked for at your hand and this was balked the
 double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
 off and you are now sailed into the north of my
 lady's opinion where you will hang like an icicle
 on a dutchman's beard unless you do redeem it by
 some laudable attempt either of valour or policy
sir andrew an't be any way it must be with valour for policy
 i hate i had as lief be a brownist as a
 politician
sir toby belch why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
 valour challenge me the count's youth to fight
 with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall
 take note of it and assure thyself there is no
 lovebroker in the world can more prevail in man's
 commendation with woman than report of valour
fabian there is no way but this sir andrew
sir andrew will either of you bear me a challenge to him
sir toby belch go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief
 it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and fun
 of invention taunt him with the licence of ink
 if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be
 amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
 paper although the sheet were big enough for the
 bed of ware in england set em down go about it

 write with a goosepen no matter about it

 youth to an answer i think oxen and wainropes
 cannot hale them together for andrew if he were

 great presage of cruelty

 augmentation of the indies you have not seen such

antonio i could not stay behind you my desire
 more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth
 and not all love to see you though so much
 as might have drawn one to a longer voyage

 unguided and unfriended often prove
 rough and unhospitable my willing love

 set forth in your pursuit
sebastian my kind antonio

 once in a seafight gainst the count his galleys
 i did some service of such note indeed
 that were i ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd
sebastian belike you slew great number of his people
antonio the offence is not of such a bloody nature
 albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
 might well have given us bloody argument
 it might have since been answer'd in repaying
 what we took from them which for traffic's sake
 most of our city did only myself stood out
 for which if i be lapsed in this place
 i shall pay dear
sebastian do not then walk too open
antonio it doth not fit me hold sir here's my purse
 in the south suburbs at the elephant

 whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
 with viewing of the town there shall you have me

 let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put
 thyself into the trick of singularity and
 consequently sets down the manner how as a sad
 face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the
 habit of some sir of note and so forth i have
 limed her but it is jove's doing and jove make me
 thankful and when she went away now let this
 fellow be looked to fellow not malvolio nor
 after my degree but fellow why every thing

 niece is already in the belief that he's mad we
 may carry it thus for our pleasure and his penance

 bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
 finder of madmen but see but see
 enter sir andrew

 some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
sir toby belch go sir andrew scout me for him at the corner the
 orchard like a bumbaily so soon as ever thou seest
 him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for
 it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a
 swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood
 more approbation than ever proof itself would have
 earned him away
sir andrew nay let me alone for swearing
 exit
sir toby belch now will not i deliver his letter for the behavior
 of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
 capacity and breeding his employment between his
 lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this
 letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no
 terror in the youth he will find it comes from a
 clodpole but sir i will deliver his challenge by
 word of mouth set upon aguecheek a notable report
 of valour and drive the gentleman as i know his
 youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous
 opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
 this will so fright them both that they will kill
 one another by the look like cockatrices
 reenter olivia with viola
fabian here he comes with your niece give them way till
 he take leave and presently after him

 for a challenge

 goes on my master's grief
olivia here wear this jewel for me tis my picture

 conduct of the lady i am no fighter i have heard

 others to taste their valour belike this is a man
 of that quirk

 very competent injury therefore get you on and
 give him his desire back you shall not to the

sebastian this is the air that is the glorious sun
 this pearl she gave me i do feel't and see't
 and though tis wonder that enwraps me thus
 yet tis not madness where's antonio then
 i could not find him at the elephant
 yet there he was and there i found this credit
 that he did range the town to seek me out
 his counsel now might do me golden service
 for though my soul disputes well with my sense
 that this may be some error but no madness
 yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
 so far exceed all instance all discourse
 that i am ready to distrust mine eyes
 and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
 to any other trust but that i am mad
 or else the lady's mad yet if twere so
 she could not sway her house command her followers
 take and give back affairs and their dispatch
 with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
 as i perceive she does there's something in't
 that is deceiveable but here the lady comes
 enter olivia and priest
olivia blame not this haste of mine if you mean well
 now go with me and with this holy man
 into the chantry by there before him
 and underneath that consecrated roof
 plight me the full assurance of your faith
 that my most jealous and too doubtful soul
 may live at peace he shall conceal it
 whiles you are willing it shall come to note
 what time we will our celebration keep
 according to my birth what do you say
sebastian i'll follow this good man and go with you
 and having sworn truth ever will be true

clown marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me
 now my foes tell me plainly i am an ass so that by
 my foes sir i profit in the knowledge of myself

 conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives
 make your two affirmatives why then the worse for
 my friends and the better for my foes
duke orsino why this is excellent
clown by my troth sir no though it please you to be
 one of my friends
duke orsino thou shalt not be the worse for me there's gold
clown but that it would be doubledealing sir i would

 and let your flesh and blood obey it
duke orsino well i will be so much a sinner to be a
 doubledealer there's another

 saying is the third pays for all the triplex
 sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of
 saint bennet sir may put you in mind one two three
duke orsino you can fool no more money out of me at this throw
 if you will let your lady know i am here to speak
 with her and bring her along with you it may awake
 my bounty further
clown marry sir lullaby to your bounty till i come
 again i go sir but i would not have you to think
 that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness
 but as you say sir let your bounty take a nap i
 will awake it anon
 exit
viola here comes the man sir that did rescue me
 enter antonio and officers
duke orsino that face of his i do remember well
 yet when i saw it last it was besmear'd
 as black as vulcan in the smoke of war
 a bawbling vessel was he captain of
 for shallow draught and bulk unprizable
 with which such scathful grapple did he make
 with the most noble bottom of our fleet
 that very envy and the tongue of loss
 cried fame and honour on him what's the matter
first officer orsino this is that antonio
 that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy
 and this is he that did the tiger board
 when your young nephew titus lost his leg
 here in the streets desperate of shame and state
 in private brabble did we apprehend him
viola he did me kindness sir drew on my side
 but in conclusion put strange speech upon me
 i know not what twas but distraction
duke orsino notable pirate thou saltwater thief
 what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
 whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
 hast made thine enemies
antonio orsino noble sir
 be pleased that i shake off these names you give me
 antonio never yet was thief or pirate
 though i confess on base and ground enough
 orsino's enemy a witchcraft drew me hither
 that most ingrateful boy there by your side
 from the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
 did i redeem a wreck past hope he was
 his life i gave him and did thereto add
 my love without retention or restraint
 all his in dedication for his sake
 did i expose myself pure for his love
 into the danger of this adverse town
 drew to defend him when he was beset
 where being apprehended his false cunning
 not meaning to partake with me in danger
 taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
 and grew a twenty years removed thing
 while one would wink denied me mine own purse
 which i had recommended to his use
 not half an hour before
viola how can this be
duke orsino when came he to this town
antonio today my lord and for three months before
 no interim not a minute's vacancy
 both day and night did we keep company
 enter olivia and attendants
duke orsino here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth
 but for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness

 cesario you do not keep promise with me
viola madam
duke orsino gracious olivia
olivia what do you say cesario good my lord
viola my lord would speak my duty hushes me
olivia if it be aught to the old tune my lord
 it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
 as howling after music
duke orsino still so cruel
olivia still so constant lord
duke orsino what to perverseness you uncivil lady
 to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
 my soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
 that e'er devotion tender'd what shall i do
olivia even what it please my lord that shall become him
duke orsino why should i not had i the heart to do it
 like to the egyptian thief at point of death
 kill what i lovea savage jealousy
 that sometimes savours nobly but hear me this
 since you to nonregardance cast my faith
 and that i partly know the instrument
 that screws me from my true place in your favour
 live you the marblebreasted tyrant still
 but this your minion whom i know you love
 and whom by heaven i swear i tender dearly
 him will i tear out of that cruel eye
 where he sits crowned in his master's spite
 come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief
 i'll sacrifice the lamb that i do love
 to spite a raven's heart within a dove
viola and i most jocund apt and willingly
 to do you rest a thousand deaths would die
olivia where goes cesario
viola after him i love
 more than i love these eyes more than my life
 more by all mores than e'er i shall love wife
 if i do feign you witnesses above
 punish my life for tainting of my love
olivia ay me detested how am i beguiled
viola who does beguile you who does do you wrong
olivia hast thou forgot thyself is it so long
 call forth the holy father
duke orsino come away

priest a contract of eternal bond of love
 confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands
 attested by the holy close of lips
 strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings
 and all the ceremony of this compact
 seal'd in my function by my testimony
 since when my watch hath told me toward my grave
 i have travell'd but two hours
duke orsino o thou dissembling cub what wilt thou be
 when time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case
 or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
 that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow

 i do perceive it hath offended you
 pardon me sweet one even for the vows
 we made each other but so late ago
duke orsino one face one voice one habit and two persons
 a natural perspective that is and is not
sebastian antonio o my dear antonio
 how have the hours rack'd and tortured me

antonio sebastian are you

olivia most wonderful
sebastian do i stand there i never had a brother
 nor can there be that deity in my nature
 of here and every where i had a sister
 whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd
 of charity what kin are you to me
 what countryman what name what parentage
viola of messaline sebastian was my father
 such a sebastian was my brother too
 so went he suited to his watery tomb
 if spirits can assume both form and suit
 you come to fright us
sebastian a spirit i am indeed
 but am in that dimension grossly clad
 which from the womb i did participate
 were you a woman as the rest goes even
 i should my tears let fall upon your cheek
 and say thricewelcome drowned viola'
viola my father had a mole upon his brow
sebastian and so had mine
viola and died that day when viola from her birth
 had number'd thirteen years
sebastian o that record is lively in my soul
 he finished indeed his mortal act
 that day that made my sister thirteen years
viola if nothing lets to make us happy both
 but this my masculine usurp'd attire
 do not embrace me till each circumstance
 of place time fortune do cohere and jump
 that i am viola which to confirm
 i'll bring you to a captain in this town
 where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
 i was preserved to serve this noble count
 all the occurrence of my fortune since
 hath been between this lady and this lord
sebastian to olivia so comes it lady you have been mistook
 but nature to her bias drew in that
 you would have been contracted to a maid
 nor are you therein by my life deceived
 you are betroth'd both to a maid and man
duke orsino be not amazed right noble is his blood
 if this be so as yet the glass seems true
 i shall have share in this most happy wreck
 to viola
 boy thou hast said to me a thousand times
 thou never shouldst love woman like to me
viola and all those sayings will i overswear
 and those swearings keep as true in soul
 as doth that orbed continent the fire
 that severs day from night
duke orsino give me thy hand
 and let me see thee in thy woman's weeds
viola the captain that did bring me first on shore
 hath my maid's garments he upon some action

 will have it as it ought to be you must allow vox
olivia prithee read i thy right wits
clown so i do madonna but to read his right wits is to
 read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear
olivia read it you sirrah
 to fabian
fabian reads by the lord madam you wrong me and the
 world shall know it though you have put me into
 darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
 me yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as
 your ladyship i have your own letter that induced
 me to the semblance i put on with the which i doubt
 not but to do myself much right or you much shame
 think of me as you please i leave my duty a little
 unthought of and speak out of my injury
 the madlyused malvolio'
olivia did he write this
clown ay madam
duke orsino this savours not much of distraction
olivia see him deliver'd fabian bring him hither
 exit fabian
 my lord so please you these things further
 thought on
 to think me as well a sister as a wife
 one day shall crown the alliance on't so please you
 here at my house and at my proper cost
duke orsino madam i am most apt to embrace your offer
 to viola
 your master quits you and for your service done him
 so much against the mettle of your sex
 so far beneath your soft and tender breeding
 and since you call'd me master for so long
 here is my hand you shall from this time be
 your master's mistress
olivia a sister you are she
 reenter fabian with malvolio
duke orsino is this the madman
olivia ay my lord this same
 how now malvolio
malvolio madam you have done me wrong
 notorious wrong
olivia have i malvolio no
malvolio lady you have pray you peruse that letter
 you must not now deny it is your hand
 write from it if you can in hand or phrase
 or say tis not your seal nor your invention
 you can say none of this well grant it then
 and tell me in the modesty of honour
 why you have given me such clear lights of favour
 bade me come smiling and crossgarter'd to you
 to put on yellow stockings and to frown
 upon sir toby and the lighter people
 and acting this in an obedient hope
 why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd
 kept in a dark house visited by the priest
 and made the most notorious geck and gull
 that e'er invention play'd on tell me why
olivia alas malvolio this is not my writing
 though i confess much like the character
 but out of question tis maria's hand
 and now i do bethink me it was she
 first told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling
 and in such forms which here were presupposed
 upon thee in the letter prithee be content
 this practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee
 but when we know the grounds and authors of it
 thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
 of thine own cause
fabian good madam hear me speak
 and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
 taint the condition of this present hour
 which i have wonder'd at in hope it shall not
 most freely i confess myself and toby
 set this device against malvolio here
 upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
 we had conceived against him maria writ
 the letter at sir toby's great importance
 in recompense whereof he hath married her
 how with a sportful malice it was follow'd
 may rather pluck on laughter than revenge
 if that the injuries be justly weigh'd
 that have on both sides pass'd
olivia alas poor fool how have they baffled thee
clown why some are born great some achieve greatness
 and some have greatness thrown upon them i was
 one sir in this interlude one sir topas sir but
 that's all one by the lord fool i am not mad'
 but do you remember madam why laugh you at such
 a barren rascal an you smile not he's gagged'
 and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
malvolio i'll be revenged on the whole pack of you
 exit
olivia he hath been most notoriously abused
duke orsino pursue him and entreat him to a peace
 he hath not told us of the captain yet
 when that is known and golden time convents
 a solemn combination shall be made
 of our dear souls meantime sweet sister
 we will not part from hence cesario come
 for so you shall be while you are a man
 but when in other habits you are seen
 orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen
 exeunt all except clown
clown sings
 when that i was and a little tiny boy
 with hey ho the wind and the rain
 a foolish thing was but a toy
 for the rain it raineth every day
 but when i came to man's estate
 with hey ho &c
 gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
 for the rain &c
 but when i came alas to wive
 with hey ho &c
 by swaggering could i never thrive
 for the rain &c
 but when i came unto my beds
 with hey ho &c
 with tosspots still had drunken heads
 for the rain &c
 a great while ago the world begun
 with hey ho &c
 but that's all one our play is done
 and we'll strive to please you every day

scene i verona an open place
 enter valentine and proteus
valentine cease to persuade my loving proteus
 homekeeping youth have ever homely wits
 were't not affection chains thy tender days
 to the sweet glances of thy honour'd love
 i rather would entreat thy company
 to see the wonders of the world abroad
 than living dully sluggardized at home
 wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
 but since thou lovest love still and thrive therein
 even as i would when i to love begin
proteus wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu
 think on thy proteus when thou haply seest
 some rare noteworthy object in thy travel
 wish me partaker in thy happiness
 when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
 if ever danger do environ thee
 commend thy grievance to my holy prayers
 for i will be thy beadsman valentine
valentine and on a lovebook pray for my success
proteus upon some book i love i'll pray for thee
valentine that's on some shallow story of deep love
 how young leander cross'd the hellespont
proteus that's a deep story of a deeper love
 for he was more than over shoes in love
valentine tis true for you are over boots in love
 and yet you never swum the hellespont
proteus over the boots nay give me not the boots
valentine no i will not for it boots thee not
proteus what
valentine to be in love where scorn is bought with groans
 coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moment's mirth
 with twenty watchful weary tedious nights
 if haply won perhaps a hapless gain
 if lost why then a grievous labour won
 however but a folly bought with wit
 or else a wit by folly vanquished
proteus so by your circumstance you call me fool
valentine so by your circumstance i fear you'll prove
proteus tis love you cavil at i am not love
valentine love is your master for he masters you
 and he that is so yoked by a fool
 methinks should not be chronicled for wise
proteus yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
 the eating canker dwells so eating love
 inhabits in the finest wits of all
valentine and writers say as the most forward bud
 is eaten by the canker ere it blow
 even so by love the young and tender wit
 is turn'd to folly blasting in the bud
 losing his verdure even in the prime
 and all the fair effects of future hopes
 but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee
 that art a votary to fond desire
 once more adieu my father at the road
 expects my coming there to see me shipp'd
proteus and thither will i bring thee valentine
valentine sweet proteus no now let us take our leave
 to milan let me hear from thee by letters
 of thy success in love and what news else
 betideth here in absence of thy friend
 and likewise will visit thee with mine
proteus all happiness bechance to thee in milan

 made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
 enter speed
speed sir proteus save you saw you my master
proteus but now he parted hence to embark for milan
speed twenty to one then he is shipp'd already
 and i have play'd the sheep in losing him
proteus indeed a sheep doth very often stray
 an if the shepherd be a while away
speed you conclude that my master is a shepherd then
 and i a sheep
proteus i do
speed why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep
proteus a silly answer and fitting well a sheep
speed this proves me still a sheep
proteus true and thy master a shepherd
speed nay that i can deny by a circumstance
proteus it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another
speed the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the
 shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks
 not me therefore i am no sheep
proteus the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the
 shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for
 wages followest thy master thy master for wages
 follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep
speed such another proof will make me cry baa'
proteus but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to julia
speed ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her
 a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a
 lost mutton nothing for my labour
proteus here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons
speed if the ground be overcharged you were best stick her
proteus nay in that you are astray twere best pound you
speed nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for
 carrying your letter
proteus you mistake i mean the pounda pinfold
speed from a pound to a pin fold it over and over
 tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
 your lover
proteus but what said she
speed first nodding ay
proteus nodaywhy that's noddy
speed you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask
 me if she did nod and i say ay'
proteus and that set together is noddy
speed now you have taken the pains to set it together
 take it for your pains
proteus no no you shall have it for bearing the letter
speed well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you
proteus why sir how do you bear with me
speed marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing
 but the word noddy for my pains
proteus beshrew me but you have a quick wit
speed and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse
proteus come come open the matter in brief what said she
speed open your purse that the money and the matter may
 be both at once delivered
proteus well sir here is for your pains what said she
speed truly sir i think you'll hardly win her
proteus why couldst thou perceive so much from her
speed sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no
 not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter
 and being so hard to me that brought your mind i
 fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
 mind give her no token but stones for she's as
 hard as steel
proteus what said she nothing
speed no not so much as take this for thy pains to
 testify your bounty i thank you you have testerned
 me in requital whereof henceforth carry your
 letters yourself and so sir i'll commend you to my master
proteus go go be gone to save your ship from wreck
 which cannot perish having thee aboard
 being destined to a drier death on shore

scene ii the same garden of julia's house
 enter julla and lucetta
julia but say lucetta now we are alone
 wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
lucetta ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully
julia of all the fair resort of gentlemen
 that every day with parle encounter me
 in thy opinion which is worthiest love
lucetta please you repeat their names i'll show my mind
 according to my shallow simple skill
julia what think'st thou of the fair sir eglamour
lucetta as of a knight wellspoken neat and fine
 but were i you he never should be mine
julia what think'st thou of the rich mercatio
lucetta well of his wealth but of himself so so
julia what think'st thou of the gentle proteus
lucetta lord lord to see what folly reigns in us
julia how now what means this passion at his name
lucetta pardon dear madam tis a passing shame
 that i unworthy body as i am
 should censure thus on lovely gentlemen
julia why not on proteus as of all the rest
lucetta then thus of many good i think him best
julia your reason
lucetta i have no other but a woman's reason
 i think him so because i think him so
julia and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
lucetta ay if you thought your love not cast away
julia why he of all the rest hath never moved me
lucetta yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye
julia his little speaking shows his love but small
lucetta fire that's closest kept burns most of all
julia they do not love that do not show their love
lucetta o they love least that let men know their love
julia i would i knew his mind
lucetta peruse this paper madam
julia to julia say from whom
lucetta that the contents will show
julia say say who gave it thee
lucetta valentine's page and sent i think from proteus
 he would have given it you but i being in the way
 did in your name receive it pardon the
 fault i pray
julia now by my modesty a goodly broker
 dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
 to whisper and conspire against my youth
 now trust me tis an office of great worth
 and you an officer fit for the place
 or else return no more into my sight
lucetta to plead for love deserves more fee than hate
julia will ye be gone
lucetta that you may ruminate
 exit
julia and yet i would i had o'erlooked the letter
 it were a shame to call her back again
 and pray her to a fault for which i chid her
 what a fool is she that knows i am a maid
 and would not force the letter to my view
 since maids in modesty say no to that
 which they would have the profferer construe ay'
 fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
 that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
 and presently all humbled kiss the rod
 how churlishly i chid lucetta hence
 when willingly i would have had her here
 how angerly i taught my brow to frown
 when inward joy enforced my heart to smile
 my penance is to call lucetta back
 and ask remission for my folly past
 what ho lucetta
 reenter lucetta
lucetta what would your ladyship
julia is't near dinnertime
lucetta i would it were
 that you might kill your stomach on your meat
 and not upon your maid
julia what is't that you took up so gingerly
lucetta nothing
julia why didst thou stoop then
lucetta to take a paper up that i let fall
julia and is that paper nothing
lucetta nothing concerning me
julia then let it lie for those that it concerns
lucetta madam it will not lie where it concerns
 unless it have a false interpeter
julia some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
lucetta that i might sing it madam to a tune
 give me a note your ladyship can set
julia as little by such toys as may be possible
 best sing it to the tune of light o love'
lucetta it is too heavy for so light a tune
julia heavy belike it hath some burden then
lucetta ay and melodious were it would you sing it
julia and why not you
lucetta i cannot reach so high
julia let's see your song how now minion
lucetta keep tune there still so you will sing it out
 and yet methinks i do not like this tune
julia you do not
lucetta no madam it is too sharp
julia you minion are too saucy
lucetta nay now you are too flat
 and mar the concord with too harsh a descant
 there wanteth but a mean to fill your song
julia the mean is drown'd with your unruly bass
lucetta indeed i bid the base for proteus
julia this babble shall not henceforth trouble me
 here is a coil with protestation
 tears the letter
 go get you gone and let the papers lie
 you would be fingering them to anger me
lucetta she makes it strange but she would be best pleased
 to be so anger'd with another letter
 exit
julia nay would i were so anger'd with the same
 o hateful hands to tear such loving words
 injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
 and kill the bees that yield it with your stings
 i'll kiss each several paper for amends
 look here is writ kind julia unkind julia
 as in revenge of thy ingratitude
 i throw thy name against the bruising stones
 trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
 and here is writ lovewounded proteus'
 poor wounded name my bosom as a bed
 shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd
 and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss
 but twice or thrice was proteus written down
 be calm good wind blow not a word away
 till i have found each letter in the letter
 except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
 unto a ragged fearfulhanging rock
 and throw it thence into the raging sea
 lo here in one line is his name twice writ
 poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus
 to the sweet julia that i'll tear away
 and yet i will not sith so prettily
 he couples it to his complaining names
 thus will i fold them one on another
 now kiss embrace contend do what you will
 reenter lucetta
lucetta madam
 dinner is ready and your father stays
julia well let us go
lucetta what shall these papers lie like telltales here
julia if you respect them best to take them up
lucetta nay i was taken up for laying them down
 yet here they shall not lie for catching cold
julia i see you have a month's mind to them
lucetta ay madam you may say what sights you see
 i see things too although you judge i wink
julia come come will't please you go

scene iii the same antonio's house
 enter antonio and panthino
antonio tell me panthino what sad talk was that
 wherewith my brother held you in the cloister
panthino twas of his nephew proteus your son
antonio why what of him
panthino he wonder'd that your lordship
 would suffer him to spend his youth at home
 while other men of slender reputation
 put forth their sons to seek preferment out
 some to the wars to try their fortune there
 some to discover islands far away
 some to the studious universities
 for any or for all these exercises
 he said that proteus your son was meet
 and did request me to importune you
 to let him spend his time no more at home
 which would be great impeachment to his age
 in having known no travel in his youth
antonio nor need'st thou much importune me to that
 whereon this month i have been hammering
 i have consider'd well his loss of time
 and how he cannot be a perfect man
 not being tried and tutor'd in the world
 experience is by industry achieved
 and perfected by the swift course of time
 then tell me whither were i best to send him
panthino i think your lordship is not ignorant
 how his companion youthful valentine
 attends the emperor in his royal court
antonio i know it well
panthino twere good i think your lordship sent him thither
 there shall he practise tilts and tournaments
 hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen
 and be in eye of every exercise
 worthy his youth and nobleness of birth
antonio i like thy counsel well hast thou advised
 and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it
 the execution of it shall make known
 even with the speediest expedition
 i will dispatch him to the emperor's court
panthino tomorrow may it please you don alphonso
 with other gentlemen of good esteem
 are journeying to salute the emperor
 and to commend their service to his will
antonio good company with them shall proteus go
 and in good time now will we break with him
 enter proteus
proteus sweet love sweet lines sweet life
 here is her hand the agent of her heart
 here is her oath for love her honour's pawn
 o that our fathers would applaud our loves
 to seal our happiness with their consents
 o heavenly julia
antonio how now what letter are you reading there
proteus may't please your lordship tis a word or two
 of commendations sent from valentine
 deliver'd by a friend that came from him
antonio lend me the letter let me see what news
proteus there is no news my lord but that he writes
 how happily he lives how well beloved
 and daily graced by the emperor
 wishing me with him partner of his fortune
antonio and how stand you affected to his wish
proteus as one relying on your lordship's will
 and not depending on his friendly wish
antonio my will is something sorted with his wish
 muse not that i thus suddenly proceed
 for what i will i will and there an end
 i am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
 with valentinus in the emperor's court
 what maintenance he from his friends receives
 like exhibition thou shalt have from me
 tomorrow be in readiness to go
 excuse it not for i am peremptory
proteus my lord i cannot be so soon provided
 please you deliberate a day or two
antonio look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee
 no more of stay tomorrow thou must go
 come on panthino you shall be employ'd
 to hasten on his expedition
 exeunt antonio and panthino
proteus thus have i shunn'd the fire for fear of burning
 and drench'd me in the sea where i am drown'd
 i fear'd to show my father julia's letter
 lest he should take exceptions to my love
 and with the vantage of mine own excuse
 hath he excepted most against my love
 o how this spring of love resembleth
 the uncertain glory of an april day
 which now shows all the beauty of the sun
 and by and by a cloud takes all away
 reenter panthino

 he is in haste therefore i pray you to go

speed she that your worship loves
valentine why how know you that i am in love
speed marry by these special marks first you have
 learned like sir proteus to wreathe your arms

 robinredbreast to walk alone like one that had
 the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had
 lost his a b c to weep like a young wench that had
 buried her grandam to fast like one that takes
 diet to watch like one that fears robbing to
 speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas you were
 wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you

 fasted it was presently after dinner when you
 looked sadly it was for want of money and now you
 are metamorphosed with a mistress that when i look
 on you i can hardly think you my master
valentine are all these things perceived in me
speed they are all perceived without ye
valentine without me they cannot
speed without you nay that's certain for without you
 were so simple none else would but you are so
 without these follies that these follies are within
 you and shine through you like the water in an
 urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a
 physician to comment on your malady
valentine but tell me dost thou know my lady silvia
speed she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
valentine hast thou observed that even she i mean
speed why sir i know her not
valentine dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet
 knowest her not
speed is she not hardfavoured sir
valentine not so fair boy as wellfavoured
speed sir i know that well enough
valentine what dost thou know
speed that she is not so fair as of you wellfavoured
valentine i mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite
speed that's because the one is painted and the other out
 of all count
valentine how painted and how out of count
speed marry sir so painted to make her fair that no
 man counts of her beauty
valentine how esteemest thou me i account of her beauty
speed you never saw her since she was deformed
valentine how long hath she been deformed
speed ever since you loved her
valentine i have loved her ever since i saw her and still i
 see her beautiful
speed if you love her you cannot see her
valentine why
speed because love is blind o that you had mine eyes
 or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
 have when you chid at sir proteus for going
 ungartered
valentine what should i see then
speed your own present folly and her passing deformity
 for he being in love could not see to garter his
 hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose
valentine belike boy then you are in love for last
 morning you could not see to wipe my shoes
speed true sir i was in love with my bed i thank you
 you swinged me for my love which makes me the
 bolder to chide you for yours
valentine in conclusion i stand affected to her
speed i would you were set so your affection would cease
valentine last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
 one she loves
speed and have you
valentine i have
speed are they not lamely writ
valentine no boy but as well as i can do them peace

valentine as you enjoin'd me i have writ your letter
 unto the secret nameless friend of yours
 which i was much unwilling to proceed in
 but for my duty to your ladyship
silvia i thank you gentle servant tis very clerkly done
valentine now trust me madam it came hardly off
 for being ignorant to whom it goes
 i writ at random very doubtfully
silvia perchance you think too much of so much pains
valentine no madam so it stead you i will write
 please you command a thousand times as much and yet
silvia a pretty period well i guess the sequel
 and yet i will not name it and yet i care not
 and yet take this again and yet i thank you
 meaning henceforth to trouble you no more
speed aside and yet you will and yet another yet'
valentine what means your ladyship do you not like it
silvia yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ
 but since unwillingly take them again
 nay take them
valentine madam they are for you
silvia ay ay you writ them sir at my request
 but i will none of them they are for you
 i would have had them writ more movingly
valentine please you i'll write your ladyship another
silvia and when it's writ for my sake read it over
 and if it please you so if not why so
valentine if it please me madam what then
silvia why if it please you take it for your labour

valentine to do what
speed to be a spokesman for madam silvia
valentine to whom
speed to yourself why she wooes you by a figure
valentine what figure
speed by a letter i should say
valentine why she hath not writ to me
speed what need she when she hath made you write to
 yourself why do you not perceive the jest
valentine no believe me
speed no believing you indeed sir but did you perceive
 her earnest
valentine she gave me none except an angry word
speed why she hath given you a letter
valentine that's the letter i writ to her friend
speed and that letter hath she delivered and there an end
valentine i would it were no worse
speed i'll warrant you tis as well
 for often have you writ to her and she in modesty
 or else for want of idle time could not again reply
 or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover
 herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover
 all this i speak in print for in print i found it
 why muse you sir tis dinnertime

silvia what angry sir thurio do you change colour

thurio that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
 in your air
valentine you have said sir
thurio ay sir and done too for this time
valentine i know it well sir you always end ere you begin
silvia a fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off
valentine tis indeed madam we thank the giver
silvia who is that servant
valentine yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire sir
 thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks
 and spends what he borrows kindly in your company
thurio sir if you spend word for word with me i shall
 make your wit bankrupt
valentine i know it well sir you have an exchequer of words
 and i think no other treasure to give your
 followers for it appears by their bare liveries
 that they live by your bare words
silvia no more gentlemen no morehere comes my father

duke now daughter silvia you are hard beset
 sir valentine your father's in good health
 what say you to a letter from your friends
 of much good news
valentine my lord i will be thankful
 to any happy messenger from thence
duke know ye don antonio your countryman
valentine ay my good lord i know the gentleman
 to be of worth and worthy estimation
 and not without desert so well reputed
duke hath he not a son
valentine ay my good lord a son that well deserves
 the honour and regard of such a father
duke you know him well
valentine i know him as myself for from our infancy
 we have conversed and spent our hours together
 and though myself have been an idle truant
 omitting the sweet benefit of time
 to clothe mine age with angellike perfection
 yet hath sir proteus for that's his name
 made use and fair advantage of his days
 his years but young but his experience old
 his head unmellow'd but his judgment ripe
 and in a word for far behind his worth
 comes all the praises that i now bestow
 he is complete in feature and in mind
 with all good grace to grace a gentleman
duke beshrew me sir but if he make this good
 he is as worthy for an empress love
 as meet to be an emperor's counsellor
 well sir this gentleman is come to me
 with commendation from great potentates
 and here he means to spend his time awhile
 i think tis no unwelcome news to you
valentine should i have wish'd a thing it had been he
duke welcome him then according to his worth
 silvia i speak to you and you sir thurio
 for valentine i need not cite him to it
 i will send him hither to you presently
 exit
valentine this is the gentleman i told your ladyship
 had come along with me but that his mistress
 did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks
silvia belike that now she hath enfranchised them
 upon some other pawn for fealty
valentine nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still
silvia nay then he should be blind and being blind
 how could he see his way to seek out you
valentine why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes
thurio they say that love hath not an eye at all
valentine to see such lovers thurio as yourself
 upon a homely object love can wink
silvia have done have done here comes the gentleman
 exit thurio
 enter proteus
valentine welcome dear proteus mistress i beseech you
 confirm his welcome with some special favour
silvia his worth is warrant for his welcome hither
 if this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from
valentine mistress it is sweet lady entertain him
 to be my fellowservant to your ladyship
silvia too low a mistress for so high a servant
proteus not so sweet lady but too mean a servant
 to have a look of such a worthy mistress
valentine leave off discourse of disability
 sweet lady entertain him for your servant
proteus my duty will i boast of nothing else
silvia and duty never yet did want his meed
 servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress
proteus i'll die on him that says so but yourself
silvia that you are welcome
proteus that you are worthless
 reenter thurio
thurio madam my lord your father would speak with you
silvia i wait upon his pleasure come sir thurio
 go with me once more new servant welcome
 i'll leave you to confer of home affairs
 when you have done we look to hear from you
proteus we'll both attend upon your ladyship
 exeunt silvia and thurio
valentine now tell me how do all from whence you came
proteus your friends are well and have them much commended
valentine and how do yours
proteus i left them all in health
valentine how does your lady and how thrives your love
proteus my tales of love were wont to weary you
 i know you joy not in a love discourse
valentine ay proteus but that life is alter'd now
 i have done penance for contemning love
 whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
 with bitter fasts with penitential groans
 with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs
 for in revenge of my contempt of love
 love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
 and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow
 o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord
 and hath so humbled me as i confess
 there is no woe to his correction
 nor to his service no such joy on earth
 now no discourse except it be of love
 now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep
 upon the very naked name of love
proteus enough i read your fortune in your eye
 was this the idol that you worship so
valentine even she and is she not a heavenly saint
proteus no but she is an earthly paragon
valentine call her divine
proteus i will not flatter her
valentine o flatter me for love delights in praises
proteus when i was sick you gave me bitter pills
 and i must minister the like to you
valentine then speak the truth by her if not divine
 yet let her be a principality
 sovereign to all the creatures on the earth
proteus except my mistress
valentine sweet except not any
 except thou wilt except against my love
proteus have i not reason to prefer mine own
valentine and i will help thee to prefer her too
 she shall be dignified with this high honour
 to bear my lady's train lest the base earth
 should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
 and of so great a favour growing proud
 disdain to root the summerswelling flower
 and make rough winter everlastingly
proteus why valentine what braggardism is this
valentine pardon me proteus all i can is nothing
 to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
 she is alone
proteus then let her alone
valentine not for the world why man she is mine own
 and i as rich in having such a jewel
 as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
 the water nectar and the rocks pure gold
 forgive me that i do not dream on thee
 because thou see'st me dote upon my love
 my foolish rival that her father likes
 only for his possessions are so huge
 is gone with her along and i must after
 for love thou know'st is full of jealousy
proteus but she loves you
valentine ay and we are betroth'd nay more our
 marriagehour
 with all the cunning manner of our flight
 determined of how i must climb her window
 the ladder made of cords and all the means
 plotted and greed on for my happiness
 good proteus go with me to my chamber
 in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
proteus go on before i shall inquire you forth
 i must unto the road to disembark
 some necessaries that i needs must use
 and then i'll presently attend you
valentine will you make haste
proteus i will
 exit valentine
 even as one heat another heat expels
 or as one nail by strength drives out another
 so the remembrance of my former love
 is by a newer object quite forgotten
 is it mine or valentine's praise
 her true perfection or my false transgression
 that makes me reasonless to reason thus
 she is fair and so is julia that i love
 that i did love for now my love is thaw'd
 which like a waxen image gainst a fire
 bears no impression of the thing it was
 methinks my zeal to valentine is cold
 and that i love him not as i was wont
 o but i love his lady too too much
 and that's the reason i love him so little
 how shall i dote on her with more advice
 that thus without advice begin to love her
 tis but her picture i have yet beheld
 and that hath dazzled my reason's light
 but when i look on her perfections
 there is no reason but i shall be blind
 if i can cheque my erring love i will
 if not to compass her i'll use my skill

proteus to leave my julia shall i be forsworn
 to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn
 to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn
 and even that power which gave me first my oath
 provokes me to this threefold perjury
 love bade me swear and love bids me forswear
 o sweetsuggesting love if thou hast sinned
 teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
 at first i did adore a twinkling star
 but now i worship a celestial sun
 unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
 and he wants wit that wants resolved will
 to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better
 fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
 whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
 with twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths
 i cannot leave to love and yet i do
 but there i leave to love where i should love
 julia i lose and valentine i lose
 if i keep them i needs must lose myself
 if i lose them thus find i by their loss
 for valentine myself for julia silvia
 i to myself am dearer than a friend
 for love is still most precious in itself
 and silviawitness heaven that made her fair
 shows julia but a swarthy ethiope
 i will forget that julia is alive
 remembering that my love to her is dead
 and valentine i'll hold an enemy
 aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend
 i cannot now prove constant to myself
 without some treachery used to valentine
 this night he meaneth with a corded ladder
 to climb celestial silvia's chamberwindow
 myself in counsel his competitor
 now presently i'll give her father notice
 of their disguising and pretended flight
 who all enraged will banish valentine
 for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
 but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross
 by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding
 love lend me wings to make my purpose swift
 as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift

scene vii verona julia's house
 enter julia and lucetta
julia counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me
 and even in kind love i do conjure thee
 who art the table wherein all my thoughts
 are visibly character'd and engraved
 to lesson me and tell me some good mean
 how with my honour i may undertake
 a journey to my loving proteus
lucetta alas the way is wearisome and long
julia a truedevoted pilgrim is not weary
 to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
 much less shall she that hath love's wings to fly
 and when the flight is made to one so dear
 of such divine perfection as sir proteus
lucetta better forbear till proteus make return
julia o know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food
 pity the dearth that i have pined in
 by longing for that food so long a time
 didst thou but know the inly touch of love
 thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
 as seek to quench the fire of love with words
lucetta i do not seek to quench your love's hot fire
 but qualify the fire's extreme rage
 lest it should burn above the bounds of reason
julia the more thou damm'st it up the more it burns
 the current that with gentle murmur glides
 thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage
 but when his fair course is not hindered
 he makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones
 giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
 he overtaketh in his pilgrimage
 and so by many winding nooks he strays
 with willing sport to the wild ocean
 then let me go and hinder not my course
 i'll be as patient as a gentle stream
 and make a pastime of each weary step
 till the last step have brought me to my love
 and there i'll rest as after much turmoil
 a blessed soul doth in elysium
lucetta but in what habit will you go along
julia not like a woman for i would prevent
 the loose encounters of lascivious men
 gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds
 as may beseem some wellreputed page
lucetta why then your ladyship must cut your hair
julia no girl i'll knit it up in silken strings
 with twenty oddconceited truelove knots
 to be fantastic may become a youth
 of greater time than i shall show to be
lucetta what fashion madam shall i make your breeches
julia that fits as well as tell me good my lord
 what compass will you wear your farthingale'
 why even what fashion thou best likest lucetta
lucetta you must needs have them with a codpiece madam
julia out out lucetta that would be illfavour'd
lucetta a round hose madam now's not worth a pin
 unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
julia lucetta as thou lovest me let me have
 what thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly
 but tell me wench how will the world repute me
 for undertaking so unstaid a journey
 i fear me it will make me scandalized
lucetta if you think so then stay at home and go not
julia nay that i will not
lucetta then never dream on infamy but go
 if proteus like your journey when you come
 no matter who's displeased when you are gone
 i fear me he will scarce be pleased withal
julia that is the least lucetta of my fear
 a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
 and instances of infinite of love
 warrant me welcome to my proteus
lucetta all these are servants to deceitful men
julia base men that use them to so base effect
 but truer stars did govern proteus birth
 his words are bonds his oaths are oracles
 his love sincere his thoughts immaculate
 his tears pure messengers sent from his heart
 his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
lucetta pray heaven he prove so when you come to him
julia now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong
 to bear a hard opinion of his truth
 only deserve my love by loving him
 and presently go with me to my chamber
 to take a note of what i stand in need of
 to furnish me upon my longing journey
 all that is mine i leave at thy dispose
 my goods my lands my reputation
 only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
 come answer not but to it presently
 i am impatient of my tarriance

scene i milan the duke's palace
 enter duke thurio and proteus
duke sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile
 we have some secrets to confer about
 exit thurio
 now tell me proteus what's your will with me
proteus my gracious lord that which i would discover
 the law of friendship bids me to conceal
 but when i call to mind your gracious favours
 done to me undeserving as i am
 my duty pricks me on to utter that
 which else no worldly good should draw from me
 know worthy prince sir valentine my friend
 this night intends to steal away your daughter
 myself am one made privy to the plot
 i know you have determined to bestow her
 on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
 and should she thus be stol'n away from you
 it would be much vexation to your age
 thus for my duty's sake i rather chose
 to cross my friend in his intended drift
 than by concealing it heap on your head
 a pack of sorrows which would press you down
 being unprevented to your timeless grave
duke proteus i thank thee for thine honest care
 which to requite command me while i live
 this love of theirs myself have often seen
 haply when they have judged me fast asleep
 and oftentimes have purposed to forbid
 sir valentine her company and my court
 but fearing lest my jealous aim might err
 and so unworthily disgrace the man
 a rashness that i ever yet have shunn'd
 i gave him gentle looks thereby to find
 that which thyself hast now disclosed to me
 and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
 knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
 i nightly lodge her in an upper tower
 the key whereof myself have ever kept
 and thence she cannot be convey'd away
proteus know noble lord they have devised a mean
 how he her chamberwindow will ascend
 and with a corded ladder fetch her down
 for which the youthful lover now is gone
 and this way comes he with it presently
 where if it please you you may intercept him
 but good my lord do it so cunningly
 that my discovery be not aimed at
 for love of you not hate unto my friend
 hath made me publisher of this pretence
duke upon mine honour he shall never know
 that i had any light from thee of this
proteus adieu my lord sir valentine is coming
 exit
 enter valentine
duke sir valentine whither away so fast
valentine please it your grace there is a messenger
 that stays to bear my letters to my friends
 and i am going to deliver them
duke be they of much import
valentine the tenor of them doth but signify
 my health and happy being at your court
duke nay then no matter stay with me awhile
 i am to break with thee of some affairs
 that touch me near wherein thou must be secret
 tis not unknown to thee that i have sought
 to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter
valentine i know it well my lord and sure the match
 were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
 is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
 beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
 cannot your grace win her to fancy him
duke no trust me she is peevish sullen froward
 proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
 neither regarding that she is my child
 nor fearing me as if i were her father
 and may i say to thee this pride of hers
 upon advice hath drawn my love from her
 and where i thought the remnant of mine age
 should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty
 i now am full resolved to take a wife
 and turn her out to who will take her in
 then let her beauty be her weddingdower
 for me and my possessions she esteems not
valentine what would your grace have me to do in this
duke there is a lady in verona here
 whom i affect but she is nice and coy
 and nought esteems my aged eloquence
 now therefore would i have thee to my tutor
 for long agone i have forgot to court
 besides the fashion of the time is changed
 how and which way i may bestow myself
 to be regarded in her sunbright eye
valentine win her with gifts if she respect not words
 dumb jewels often in their silent kind
 more than quick words do move a woman's mind
duke but she did scorn a present that i sent her
valentine a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her
 send her another never give her o'er
 for scorn at first makes afterlove the more
 if she do frown tis not in hate of you
 but rather to beget more love in you
 if she do chide tis not to have you gone
 for why the fools are mad if left alone
 take no repulse whatever she doth say
 for get you gone she doth not mean away'
 flatter and praise commend extol their graces
 though ne'er so black say they have angels faces
 that man that hath a tongue i say is no man
 if with his tongue he cannot win a woman
duke but she i mean is promised by her friends
 unto a youthful gentleman of worth
 and kept severely from resort of men
 that no man hath access by day to her
valentine why then i would resort to her by night
duke ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe
 that no man hath recourse to her by night
valentine what lets but one may enter at her window
duke her chamber is aloft far from the ground
 and built so shelving that one cannot climb it
 without apparent hazard of his life
valentine why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
 to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
 would serve to scale another hero's tower
 so bold leander would adventure it
duke now as thou art a gentleman of blood
 advise me where i may have such a ladder
valentine when would you use it pray sir tell me that
duke this very night for love is like a child
 that longs for every thing that he can come by
valentine by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder
duke but hark thee i will go to her alone
 how shall i best convey the ladder thither
valentine it will be light my lord that you may bear it
 under a cloak that is of any length
duke a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
valentine ay my good lord
duke then let me see thy cloak
 i'll get me one of such another length
valentine why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
duke how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak
 i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
 what letter is this same what's here to silvia'
 and here an engine fit for my proceeding
 i'll be so bold to break the seal for once
 reads
 my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly
 and slaves they are to me that send them flying
 o could their master come and go as lightly
 himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
 my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
 while i their king that hither them importune
 do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them
 because myself do want my servants fortune
 i curse myself for they are sent by me
 that they should harbour where their lord would be'
 what's here
 silvia this night i will enfranchise thee'
 tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose
 why phaetonfor thou art merops son
 wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
 and with thy daring folly burn the world
 wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
 go base intruder overweening slave
 bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
 and think my patience more than thy desert
 is privilege for thy departure hence
 thank me for this more than for all the favours
 which all too much i have bestow'd on thee
 but if thou linger in my territories
 longer than swiftest expedition
 will give thee time to leave our royal court
 by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
 i ever bore my daughter or thyself
 be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse
 but as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence
 exit
valentine and why not death rather than living torment
 to die is to be banish'd from myself
 and silvia is myself banish'd from her
 is self from self a deadly banishment
 what light is light if silvia be not seen
 what joy is joy if silvia be not by
 unless it be to think that she is by
 and feed upon the shadow of perfection
 except i be by silvia in the night
 there is no music in the nightingale
 unless i look on silvia in the day
 there is no day for me to look upon
 she is my essence and i leave to be
 if i be not by her fair influence
 foster'd illumined cherish'd kept alive
 i fly not death to fly his deadly doom
 tarry i here i but attend on death
 but fly i hence i fly away from life
 enter proteus and launce

valentine neither
proteus what then
valentine nothing
launce can nothing speak master shall i strike
proteus who wouldst thou strike
launce nothing
proteus villain forbear
launce why sir i'll strike nothing i pray you
proteus sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word
valentine my ears are stopt and cannot hear good news
 so much of bad already hath possess'd them
proteus then in dumb silence will i bury mine
 for they are harsh untuneable and bad
valentine is silvia dead
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine indeed for sacred silvia
 hath she forsworn me
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine if silvia have forsworn me
 what is your news
launce sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished
proteus that thou art banishedo that's the news
 from hence from silvia and from me thy friend
valentine o i have fed upon this woe already
 and now excess of it will make me surfeit
 doth silvia know that i am banished
proteus ay ay and she hath offer'd to the doom
 which unreversed stands in effectual force
 a sea of melting pearl which some call tears
 those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd
 with them upon her knees her humble self
 wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
 as if but now they waxed pale for woe
 but neither bended knees pure hands held up
 sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears
 could penetrate her uncompassionate sire
 but valentine if he be ta'en must die
 besides her intercession chafed him so
 when she for thy repeal was suppliant
 that to close prison he commanded her
 with many bitter threats of biding there
valentine no more unless the next word that thou speak'st
 have some malignant power upon my life
 if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear
 as ending anthem of my endless dolour
proteus cease to lament for that thou canst not help
 and study help for that which thou lament'st
 time is the nurse and breeder of all good
 here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
 besides thy staying will abridge thy life
 hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that
 and manage it against despairing thoughts
 thy letters may be here though thou art hence
 which being writ to me shall be deliver'd
 even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love
 the time now serves not to expostulate
 come i'll convey thee through the citygate
 and ere i part with thee confer at large
 of all that may concern thy loveaffairs
 as thou lovest silvia though not for thyself
 regard thy danger and along with me
valentine i pray thee launce an if thou seest my boy
 bid him make haste and meet me at the northgate
proteus go sirrah find him out come valentine
valentine o my dear silvia hapless valentine
 exeunt valentine and proteus
launce i am but a fool look you and yet i have the wit to
 think my master is a kind of a knave but that's

 team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who
 tis i love and yet tis a woman but what woman i

act iii
scene ii the same the duke's palace
 enter duke and thurio
duke sir thurio fear not but that she will love you
 now valentine is banish'd from her sight
thurio since his exile she hath despised me most
 forsworn my company and rail'd at me
 that i am desperate of obtaining her
duke this weak impress of love is as a figure
 trenched in ice which with an hour's heat
 dissolves to water and doth lose his form
 a little time will melt her frozen thoughts
 and worthless valentine shall be forgot
 enter proteus
 how now sir proteus is your countryman
 according to our proclamation gone
proteus gone my good lord
duke my daughter takes his going grievously
proteus a little time my lord will kill that grief
duke so i believe but thurio thinks not so
 proteus the good conceit i hold of thee
 for thou hast shown some sign of good desert
 makes me the better to confer with thee
proteus longer than i prove loyal to your grace
 let me not live to look upon your grace
duke thou know'st how willingly i would effect
 the match between sir thurio and my daughter
proteus i do my lord
duke and also i think thou art not ignorant
 how she opposes her against my will
proteus she did my lord when valentine was here
duke ay and perversely she persevers so
 what might we do to make the girl forget
 the love of valentine and love sir thurio
proteus the best way is to slander valentine
 with falsehood cowardice and poor descent
 three things that women highly hold in hate
duke ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate
proteus ay if his enemy deliver it
 therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
 by one whom she esteemeth as his friend
duke then you must undertake to slander him
proteus and that my lord i shall be loath to do
 tis an ill office for a gentleman
 especially against his very friend
duke where your good word cannot advantage him
 your slander never can endamage him
 therefore the office is indifferent
 being entreated to it by your friend
proteus you have prevail'd my lord if i can do it
 by ought that i can speak in his dispraise
 she shall not long continue love to him
 but say this weed her love from valentine
 it follows not that she will love sir thurio
thurio therefore as you unwind her love from him
 lest it should ravel and be good to none
 you must provide to bottom it on me
 which must be done by praising me as much
 as you in worth dispraise sir valentine
duke and proteus we dare trust you in this kind
 because we know on valentine's report
 you are already love's firm votary
 and cannot soon revolt and change your mind
 upon this warrant shall you have access
 where you with silvia may confer at large
 for she is lumpish heavy melancholy
 and for your friend's sake will be glad of you
 where you may temper her by your persuasion
 to hate young valentine and love my friend
proteus as much as i can do i will effect
 but you sir thurio are not sharp enough
 you must lay lime to tangle her desires
 by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
 should be fullfraught with serviceable vows
duke ay
 much is the force of heavenbred poesy
proteus say that upon the altar of her beauty
 you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
 write till your ink be dry and with your tears
 moist it again and frame some feeling line
 that may discover such integrity
 for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews
 whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
 make tigers tame and huge leviathans
 forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
 after your direlamenting elegies
 visit by night your lady's chamberwindow
 with some sweet concert to their instruments
 tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence
 will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance
 this or else nothing will inherit her
duke this discipline shows thou hast been in love
thurio and thy advice this night i'll put in practise
 therefore sweet proteus my directiongiver
 let us into the city presently
 to sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music
 i have a sonnet that will serve the turn
 to give the onset to thy good advice
duke about it gentlemen
proteus we'll wait upon your grace till after supper
 and afterward determine our proceedings
duke even now about it i will pardon you

second outlaw if there be ten shrink not but down with em

third outlaw stand sir and throw us that you have about ye
 if not we'll make you sit and rifle you
speed sir we are undone these are the villains
 that all the travellers do fear so much
valentine my friends
first outlaw that's not so sir we are your enemies
second outlaw peace we'll hear him
third outlaw ay by my beard will we for he's a proper man
valentine then know that i have little wealth to lose
 a man i am cross'd with adversity
 my riches are these poor habiliments
 of which if you should here disfurnish me
 you take the sum and substance that i have
second outlaw whither travel you
valentine to verona
first outlaw whence came you
valentine from milan
third outlaw have you long sojourned there
valentine some sixteen months and longer might have stay'd
 if crooked fortune had not thwarted me
first outlaw what were you banish'd thence
valentine i was
second outlaw for what offence
valentine for that which now torments me to rehearse
 i kill'd a man whose death i much repent
 but yet i slew him manfully in fight
 without false vantage or base treachery
first outlaw why ne'er repent it if it were done so
 but were you banish'd for so small a fault
valentine i was and held me glad of such a doom
second outlaw have you the tongues
valentine my youthful travel therein made me happy
 or else i often had been miserable
third outlaw by the bare scalp of robin hood's fat friar
 this fellow were a king for our wild faction
first outlaw we'll have him sirs a word
speed master be one of them it's an honourable kind of thievery
valentine peace villain
second outlaw tell us this have you any thing to take to
valentine nothing but my fortune
third outlaw know then that some of us are gentlemen
 such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
 thrust from the company of awful men
 myself was from verona banished
 for practising to steal away a lady
 an heir and near allied unto the duke
second outlaw and i from mantua for a gentleman
 who in my mood i stabb'd unto the heart
first outlaw and i for such like petty crimes as these
 but to the purposefor we cite our faults
 that they may hold excus'd our lawless lives
 and partly seeing you are beautified
 with goodly shape and by your own report
 a linguist and a man of such perfection
 as we do in our quality much want
second outlaw indeed because you are a banish'd man
 therefore above the rest we parley to you
 are you content to be our general
 to make a virtue of necessity
 and live as we do in this wilderness
third outlaw what say'st thou wilt thou be of our consort
 say ay and be the captain of us all
 we'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee
 love thee as our commander and our king
first outlaw but if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
second outlaw thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd
valentine i take your offer and will live with you
 provided that you do no outrages
 on silly women or poor passengers
third outlaw no we detest such vile base practises
 come go with us we'll bring thee to our crews
 and show thee all the treasure we have got
 which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose

scene ii milan outside the duke's palace under silvia's chamber
 enter proteus
proteus already have i been false to valentine
 and now i must be as unjust to thurio
 under the colour of commending him
 i have access my own love to prefer
 but silvia is too fair too true too holy
 to be corrupted with my worthless gifts
 when i protest true loyalty to her
 she twits me with my falsehood to my friend
 when to her beauty i commend my vows
 she bids me think how i have been forsworn
 in breaking faith with julia whom i loved
 and notwithstanding all her sudden quips
 the least whereof would quell a lover's hope
 yet spaniellike the more she spurns my love
 the more it grows and fawneth on her still
 but here comes thurio now must we to her window
 and give some evening music to her ear
 enter thurio and musicians
thurio how now sir proteus are you crept before us
proteus ay gentle thurio for you know that love
 will creep in service where it cannot go

host ay but peace let's hear em
 song
 who is silvia what is she
 that all our swains commend her
 holy fair and wise is she
 the heaven such grace did lend her
 that she might admired be
 is she kind as she is fair
 for beauty lives with kindness
 love doth to her eyes repair
 to help him of his blindness
 and being help'd inhabits there
 then to silvia let us sing
 that silvia is excelling
 she excels each mortal thing
 upon the dull earth dwelling
 to her let us garlands bring
host how now are you sadder than you were before how
 do you man the music likes you not
julia you mistake the musician likes me not
host why my pretty youth
julia he plays false father
host how out of tune on the strings
julia not so but yet so false that he grieves my very
 heartstrings
host you have a quick ear
julia ay i would i were deaf it makes me have a slow heart
host i perceive you delight not in music
julia not a whit when it jars so
host hark what fine change is in the music
julia ay that change is the spite
host you would have them always play but one thing
julia i would always have one play but one thing
 but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on
 often resort unto this gentlewoman
host i tell you what launce his man told me he loved
 her out of all nick
julia where is launce
host gone to seek his dog which tomorrow by his
 master's command he must carry for a present to his lady
julia peace stand aside the company parts

 that you shall say my cunning drift excels

proteus madam good even to your ladyship
silvia i thank you for your music gentlemen

silvia sir proteus as i take it
proteus sir proteus gentle lady and your servant
silvia what's your will
proteus that i may compass yours
silvia you have your wish my will is even this
 that presently you hie you home to bed
 thou subtle perjured false disloyal man
 think'st thou i am so shallow so conceitless
 to be seduced by thy flattery
 that hast deceived so many with thy vows
 return return and make thy love amends
 for me by this pale queen of night i swear
 i am so far from granting thy request
 that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit
 and by and by intend to chide myself
 even for this time i spend in talking to thee
proteus i grant sweet love that i did love a lady
 but she is dead
julia aside twere false if i should speak it
 for i am sure she is not buried
silvia say that she be yet valentine thy friend
 survives to whom thyself art witness
 i am betroth'd and art thou not ashamed
 to wrong him with thy importunacy
proteus i likewise hear that valentine is dead
silvia and so suppose am i for in his grave
 assure thyself my love is buried
proteus sweet lady let me rake it from the earth
silvia go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence
 or at the least in hers sepulchre thine
julia aside he heard not that
proteus madam if your heart be so obdurate
 vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
 the picture that is hanging in your chamber
 to that i'll speak to that i'll sigh and weep
 for since the substance of your perfect self
 is else devoted i am but a shadow
 and to your shadow will i make true love
julia aside if twere a substance you would sure
 deceive it
 and make it but a shadow as i am
silvia i am very loath to be your idol sir
 but since your falsehood shall become you well
 to worship shadows and adore false shapes
 send to me in the morning and i'll send it
 and so good rest
proteus as wretches have o'ernight
 that wait for execution in the morn

 no grief did ever come so near thy heart
 as when thy lady and thy true love died
 upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity
 sir eglamour i would to valentine
 to mantua where i hear he makes abode
 and for the ways are dangerous to pass
 i do desire thy worthy company
 upon whose faith and honour i repose
 urge not my father's anger eglamour
 but think upon my grief a lady's grief
 and on the justice of my flying hence
 to keep me from a most unholy match
 which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
 i do desire thee even from a heart
 as full of sorrows as the sea of sands
 to bear me company and go with me
 if not to hide what i have said to thee
 that i may venture to depart alone
eglamour madam i pity much your grievances
 which since i know they virtuously are placed
 i give consent to go along with you
 recking as little what betideth me
 as much i wish all good befortune you

 look you it goes hard one that i brought up of a
 puppy one that i saved from drowning when three or
 four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it
 i have taught him even as one would say precisely
 thus i would teach a dog i was sent to deliver
 him as a present to mistress silvia from my master
 and i came no sooner into the diningchamber but he
 steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg
 o tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
 in all companies i would have as one should say
 one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be
 as it were a dog at all things if i had not had
 more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did
 i think verily he had been hanged for't sure as i
 live he had suffered for't you shall judge he
 thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
 gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table he had
 not been therebless the marka pissing while but
 all the chamber smelt him out with the dog says
 one what cur is that says another whip him
 out says the third hang him up says the duke
 i having been acquainted with the smell before
 knew it was crab and goes me to the fellow that
 whips the dogs friend quoth i you mean to whip
 the dog ay marry do i quoth he you do him
 the more wrong quoth i 'twas i did the thing you
 wot of he makes me no more ado but whips me out
 of the chamber how many masters would do this for
 his servant nay i'll be sworn i have sat in the
 stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had
 been executed i have stood on the pillory for geese
 he hath killed otherwise he had suffered for't
 thou thinkest not of this now nay i remember the
 trick you served me when i took my leave of madam

 do when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
 water against a gentlewoman's farthingale didst

proteus what didst thou offer her this from me
launce ay sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by
 the hangman boys in the marketplace and then i

proteus go get thee hence and find my dog again
 or ne'er return again into my sight
 away i say stay'st thou to vex me here
 exit launce
 a slave that still an end turns me to shame
 sebastian i have entertained thee
 partly that i have need of such a youth
 that can with some discretion do my business
 for tis no trusting to yond foolish lout
 but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior
 which if my augury deceive me not
 witness good bringing up fortune and truth
 therefore know thou for this i entertain thee
 go presently and take this ring with thee
 deliver it to madam silvia
 she loved me well deliver'd it to me
julia it seems you loved not her to leave her token
 she is dead belike
proteus not so i think she lives
julia alas
proteus why dost thou cry alas'
julia i cannot choose
 but pity her
proteus wherefore shouldst thou pity her
julia because methinks that she loved you as well
 as you do love your lady silvia
 she dreams of him that has forgot her love
 you dote on her that cares not for your love
 tis pity love should be so contrary
 and thinking of it makes me cry alas'
proteus well give her that ring and therewithal
 this letter that's her chamber tell my lady
 i claim the promise for her heavenly picture
 your message done hie home unto my chamber
 where thou shalt find me sad and solitary
 exit
julia how many women would do such a message
 alas poor proteus thou hast entertain'd
 a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
 alas poor fool why do i pity him
 that with his very heart despiseth me
 because he loves her he despiseth me
 because i love him i must pity him
 this ring i gave him when he parted from me
 to bind him to remember my good will
 and now am i unhappy messenger
 to plead for that which i would not obtain
 to carry that which i would have refused
 to praise his faith which i would have dispraised
 i am my master's trueconfirmed love
 but cannot be true servant to my master
 unless i prove false traitor to myself
 yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly
 as heaven it knows i would not have him speed
 enter silvia attended
 gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean
 to bring me where to speak with madam silvia
silvia what would you with her if that i be she
julia if you be she i do entreat your patience
 to hear me speak the message i am sent on
silvia from whom
julia from my master sir proteus madam
silvia o he sends you for a picture
julia ay madam
silvia ursula bring my picture here
 go give your master this tell him from me
 one julia that his changing thoughts forget
 would better fit his chamber than this shadow
julia madam please you peruse this letter
 pardon me madam i have unadvised
 deliver'd you a paper that i should not
 this is the letter to your ladyship
silvia i pray thee let me look on that again
julia it may not be good madam pardon me
silvia there hold
 i will not look upon your master's lines
 i know they are stuff'd with protestations
 and full of newfound oaths which he will break
 as easily as i do tear his paper
julia madam he sends your ladyship this ring
silvia the more shame for him that he sends it me
 for i have heard him say a thousand times
 his julia gave it him at his departure
 though his false finger have profaned the ring
 mine shall not do his julia so much wrong
julia she thanks you
silvia what say'st thou
julia i thank you madam that you tender her
 poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
silvia dost thou know her
julia almost as well as i do know myself
 to think upon her woes i do protest
 that i have wept a hundred several times
silvia belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her
julia i think she doth and that's her cause of sorrow
silvia is she not passing fair
julia she hath been fairer madam than she is
 when she did think my master loved her well
 she in my judgment was as fair as you
 but since she did neglect her lookingglass
 and threw her sunexpelling mask away
 the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
 and pinch'd the lilytincture of her face
 that now she is become as black as i
silvia how tall was she
julia about my stature for at pentecost
 when all our pageants of delight were play'd
 our youth got me to play the woman's part
 and i was trimm'd in madam julia's gown
 which served me as fit by all men's judgments
 as if the garment had been made for me
 therefore i know she is about my height
 and at that time i made her weep agood
 for i did play a lamentable part
 madam twas ariadne passioning
 for theseus perjury and unjust flight
 which i so lively acted with my tears
 that my poor mistress moved therewithal
 wept bitterly and would i might be dead
 if i in thought felt not her very sorrow
silvia she is beholding to thee gentle youth
 alas poor lady desolate and left
 i weep myself to think upon thy words
 here youth there is my purse i give thee this
 for thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovest her
 farewell
 exit silvia with attendants
julia and she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her
 a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
 i hope my master's suit will be but cold
 since she respects my mistress love so much
 alas how love can trifle with itself
 here is her picture let me see i think
 if i had such a tire this face of mine
 were full as lovely as is this of hers
 and yet the painter flatter'd her a little
 unless i flatter with myself too much
 her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
 if that be all the difference in his love
 i'll get me such a colour'd periwig
 her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
 ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high
 what should it be that he respects in her
 but i can make respective in myself
 if this fond love were not a blinded god
 come shadow come and take this shadow up
 for tis thy rival o thou senseless form
 thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd loved and adored
 and were there sense in his idolatry
 my substance should be statue in thy stead
 i'll use thee kindly for thy mistress sake
 that used me so or else by jove i vow
 i should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
 to make my master out of love with thee

proteus o sir i find her milder than she was

thurio what that my leg is too long
proteus no that it is too little
thurio i'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder
julia aside but love will not be spurr'd to what
 it loathes
thurio what says she to my face
proteus she says it is a fair one
thurio nay then the wanton lies my face is black
proteus but pearls are fair and the old saying is
 black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes
julia aside tis true such pearls as put out
 ladies eyes
 for i had rather wink than look on them
thurio how likes she my discourse
proteus ill when you talk of war
thurio but well when i discourse of love and peace
julia aside but better indeed when you hold your peace
thurio what says she to my valour
proteus o sir she makes no doubt of that
julia aside she needs not when she knows it cowardice
thurio what says she to my birth
proteus that you are well derived
julia aside true from a gentleman to a fool
thurio considers she my possessions
proteus o ay and pities them
thurio wherefore
julia aside that such an ass should owe them
proteus that they are out by lease
julia here comes the duke
 enter duke

 which of you saw sir eglamour of late
thurio not i
proteus nor i
duke saw you my daughter
proteus neither
duke why then
 she's fled unto that peasant valentine
 and eglamour is in her company
 tis true for friar laurence met them both
 as he in penance wander'd through the forest
 him he knew well and guess'd that it was she
 but being mask'd he was not sure of it
 besides she did intend confession
 at patrick's cell this even and there she was not
 these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
 therefore i pray you stand not to discourse
 but mount you presently and meet with me
 upon the rising of the mountainfoot
 that leads towards mantua whither they are fled
 dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me
 exit
thurio why this it is to be a peevish girl
 that flies her fortune when it follows her
 i'll after more to be revenged on eglamour
 than for the love of reckless silvia
 exit
proteus and i will follow more for silvia's love
 than hate of eglamour that goes with her
 exit
julia and i will follow more to cross that love

 enter valentine
valentine how use doth breed a habit in a man
 this shadowy desert unfrequented woods
 i better brook than flourishing peopled towns
 here can i sit alone unseen of any
 and to the nightingale's complaining notes
 tune my distresses and record my woes
 o thou that dost inhabit in my breast
 leave not the mansion so long tenantless
 lest growing ruinous the building fall
 and leave no memory of what it was
 repair me with thy presence silvia
 thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain
 what halloing and what stir is this today
 these are my mates that make their wills their law
 have some unhappy passenger in chase
 they love me well yet i have much to do
 to keep them from uncivil outrages
 withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here
 enter proteus silvia and julia
proteus madam this service i have done for you
 though you respect not aught your servant doth
 to hazard life and rescue you from him
 that would have forced your honour and your love
 vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
 a smaller boon than this i cannot beg
 and less than this i am sure you cannot give
valentine aside how like a dream is this i see and hear
 love lend me patience to forbear awhile
silvia o miserable unhappy that i am
proteus unhappy were you madam ere i came
 but by my coming i have made you happy
silvia by thy approach thou makest me most unhappy
julia aside and me when he approacheth to your presence
silvia had i been seized by a hungry lion
 i would have been a breakfast to the beast
 rather than have false proteus rescue me
 o heaven be judge how i love valentine
 whose life's as tender to me as my soul
 and full as much for more there cannot be
 i do detest false perjured proteus
 therefore be gone solicit me no more
proteus what dangerous action stood it next to death
 would i not undergo for one calm look
 o tis the curse in love and still approved
 when women cannot love where they're beloved
silvia when proteus cannot love where he's beloved
 read over julia's heart thy first best love
 for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
 into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
 descended into perjury to love me
 thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two
 and that's far worse than none better have none
 than plural faith which is too much by one
 thou counterfeit to thy true friend
proteus in love
 who respects friend
silvia all men but proteus
proteus nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
 can no way change you to a milder form
 i'll woo you like a soldier at arms end
 and love you gainst the nature of loveforce ye
silvia o heaven
proteus i'll force thee yield to my desire
valentine ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
 thou friend of an ill fashion
proteus valentine
valentine thou common friend that's without faith or love
 for such is a friend now treacherous man
 thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye
 could have persuaded me now i dare not say
 i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
 who should be trusted when one's own right hand
 is perjured to the bosom proteus
 i am sorry i must never trust thee more
 but count the world a stranger for thy sake
 the private wound is deepest o time most accurst
 mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
proteus my shame and guilt confounds me
 forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow
 be a sufficient ransom for offence
 i tender t here i do as truly suffer
 as e'er i did commit
valentine then i am paid
 and once again i do receive thee honest
 who by repentance is not satisfied
 is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased
 by penitence the eternal's wrath's appeased
 and that my love may appear plain and free
 all that was mine in silvia i give thee
julia o me unhappy
 swoons
proteus look to the boy
valentine why boy why wag how now what's the matter
 look up speak
julia o good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring
 to madam silvia which out of my neglect was never done
proteus where is that ring boy
julia here tis this is it
proteus how let me see
 why this is the ring i gave to julia
julia o cry you mercy sir i have mistook
 this is the ring you sent to silvia
proteus but how camest thou by this ring at my depart
 i gave this unto julia
julia and julia herself did give it me
 and julia herself hath brought it hither
proteus how julia
julia behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
 and entertain'd em deeply in her heart
 how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
 o proteus let this habit make thee blush
 be thou ashamed that i have took upon me
 such an immodest raiment if shame live
 in a disguise of love
 it is the lesser blot modesty finds
 women to change their shapes than men their minds
proteus than men their minds tis true
 o heaven were man
 but constant he were perfect that one error
 fills him with faults makes him run through all the sins
 inconstancy falls off ere it begins
 what is in silvia's face but i may spy
 more fresh in julia's with a constant eye
valentine come come a hand from either
 let me be blest to make this happy close
 twere pity two such friends should be long foes
proteus bear witness heaven i have my wish for ever
julia and i mine
 enter outlaws with duke and thurio
outlaws a prize a prize a prize
valentine forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke
 your grace is welcome to a man disgraced
 banished valentine
duke sir valentine
thurio yonder is silvia and silvia's mine
valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death
 come not within the measure of my wrath
 do not name silvia thine if once again
 verona shall not hold thee here she stands
 take but possession of her with a touch
 i dare thee but to breathe upon my love
thurio sir valentine i care not for her i
 i hold him but a fool that will endanger
 his body for a girl that loves him not
 i claim her not and therefore she is thine
duke the more degenerate and base art thou
 to make such means for her as thou hast done
 and leave her on such slight conditions
 now by the honour of my ancestry
 i do applaud thy spirit valentine
 and think thee worthy of an empress love
 know then i here forget all former griefs
 cancel all grudge repeal thee home again
 plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit
 to which i thus subscribe sir valentine
 thou art a gentleman and well derived
 take thou thy silvia for thou hast deserved her
valentine i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy
 i now beseech you for your daughter's sake
 to grant one boom that i shall ask of you
duke i grant it for thine own whate'er it be
valentine these banish'd men that i have kept withal
 are men endued with worthy qualities
 forgive them what they have committed here
 and let them be recall'd from their exile
 they are reformed civil full of good
 and fit for great employment worthy lord
duke thou hast prevail'd i pardon them and thee
 dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts
 come let us go we will include all jars
 with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity
valentine and as we walk along i dare be bold
 with our discourse to make your grace to smile
 what think you of this page my lord
duke i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
valentine i warrant you my lord more grace than boy
duke what mean you by that saying
valentine please you i'll tell you as we pass along
 that you will wonder what hath fortuned
 come proteus tis your penance but to hear
 the story of your loves discovered
 that done our day of marriage shall be yours

 enter camillo and archidamus
archidamus if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on
 the like occasion whereon my services are now on
 foot you shall see as i have said great
 difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia
camillo i think this coming summer the king of sicilia
 means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
archidamus wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
 justified in our loves for indeed
camillo beseech you
archidamus verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge
 we cannot with such magnificencein so rarei know
 not what to say we will give you sleepy drinks
 that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience
 may though they cannot praise us as little accuse
 us
camillo you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely
archidamus believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me
 and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
camillo sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia
 they were trained together in their childhoods and
 there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
 which cannot choose but branch now since their
 more mature dignities and royal necessities made
 separation of their society their encounters
 though not personal have been royally attorneyed
 with interchange of gifts letters loving
 embassies that they have seemed to be together
 though absent shook hands as over a vast and
 embraced as it were from the ends of opposed
 winds the heavens continue their loves
archidamus i think there is not in the world either malice or
 matter to alter it you have an unspeakable
 comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a
 gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
 into my note
camillo i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it
 is a gallant child one that indeed physics the
 subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on
 crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
 see him a man
archidamus would they else be content to die
camillo yes if there were no other excuse why they should
 desire to live
archidamus if the king had no son they would desire to live
 on crutches till he had one

 polixenes camillo and attendants
polixenes nine changes of the watery star hath been
 the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
 without a burthen time as long again
 would be find up my brother with our thanks
 and yet we should for perpetuity
 go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher
 yet standing in rich place i multiply
 with one we thank you many thousands moe
 that go before it
leontes stay your thanks a while
 and pay them when you part
polixenes sir that's tomorrow
 i am question'd by my fears of what may chance
 or breed upon our absence that may blow
 no sneaping winds at home to make us say
 this is put forth too truly besides i have stay'd
 to tire your royalty
leontes we are tougher brother
 than you can put us to't
polixenes no longer stay
leontes one sevennight longer
polixenes very sooth tomorrow
leontes we'll part the time between's then and in that
 i'll no gainsaying
polixenes press me not beseech you so
 there is no tongue that moves none none i the world
 so soon as yours could win me so it should now
 were there necessity in your request although
 twere needful i denied it my affairs
 do even drag me homeward which to hinder
 were in your love a whip to me my stay
 to you a charge and trouble to save both
 farewell our brother
leontes tonguetied our queen
 speak you
hermione i had thought sir to have held my peace until
 you have drawn oaths from him not to stay you sir
 charge him too coldly tell him you are sure
 all in bohemia's well this satisfaction
 the bygone day proclaim'd say this to him
 he's beat from his best ward
leontes well said hermione
hermione to tell he longs to see his son were strong
 but let him say so then and let him go
 but let him swear so and he shall not stay
 we'll thwack him hence with distaffs
 yet of your royal presence i'll adventure
 the borrow of a week when at bohemia
 you take my lord i'll give him my commission
 to let him there a month behind the gest
 prefix'd for's parting yet good deed leontes
 i love thee not a jar o the clock behind
 what ladyshe her lord you'll stay
polixenes no madam
hermione nay but you will
polixenes i may not verily
hermione verily
 you put me off with limber vows but i
 though you would seek to unsphere the
 stars with oaths
 should yet say sir no going verily
 you shall not go a lady's verily s
 as potent as a lord's will you go yet
 force me to keep you as a prisoner
 not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
 when you depart and save your thanks how say you
 my prisoner or my guest by your dread verily'
 one of them you shall be
polixenes your guest then madam
 to be your prisoner should import offending
 which is for me less easy to commit
 than you to punish
hermione not your gaoler then
 but your kind hostess come i'll question you
 of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys
 you were pretty lordings then
polixenes we were fair queen
 two lads that thought there was no more behind
 but such a day tomorrow as today
 and to be boy eternal
hermione was not my lord
 the verier wag o the two
polixenes we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i the sun
 and bleat the one at the other what we changed
 was innocence for innocence we knew not
 the doctrine of illdoing nor dream'd
 that any did had we pursued that life
 and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
 with stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven
 boldly not guilty the imposition clear'd
 hereditary ours
hermione by this we gather
 you have tripp'd since
polixenes o my most sacred lady
 temptations have since then been born to's for
 in those unfledged days was my wife a girl
 your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
 of my young playfellow
hermione grace to boot
 of this make no conclusion lest you say
 your queen and i are devils yet go on
 the offences we have made you do we'll answer
 if you first sinn'd with us and that with us
 you did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
 with any but with us
leontes is he won yet
hermione he'll stay my lord
leontes at my request he would not
 hermione my dearest thou never spokest
 to better purpose
hermione never
leontes never but once
hermione what have i twice said well when was't before
 i prithee tell me cram's with praise and make's
 as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless
 slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
 our praises are our wages you may ride's
 with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
 with spur we beat an acre but to the goal
 my last good deed was to entreat his stay
 what was my first it has an elder sister
 or i mistake you o would her name were grace
 but once before i spoke to the purpose when
 nay let me have't i long
leontes why that was when
 three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death
 ere i could make thee open thy white hand
 and clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
 i am yours for ever'
hermione tis grace indeed
 why lo you now i have spoke to the purpose twice
 the one for ever earn'd a royal husband
 the other for some while a friend
leontes aside too hot too hot
 to mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
 i have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
 but not for joy not joy this entertainment
 may a free face put on derive a liberty
 from heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
 and well become the agent t may i grant
 but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
 as now they are and making practised smiles
 as in a lookingglass and then to sigh as twere
 the mort o the deer o that is entertainment
 my bosom likes not nor my brows mamillius
 art thou my boy
mamillius ay my good lord
leontes i fecks
 why that's my bawcock what hast
 smutch'd thy nose
 they say it is a copy out of mine come captain
 we must be neat not neat but cleanly captain
 and yet the steer the heifer and the calf
 are all call'd neatstill virginalling
 upon his palmhow now you wanton calf
 art thou my calf
mamillius yes if you will my lord
leontes thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have
 to be full like me yet they say we are
 almost as like as eggs women say so
 that will say anything but were they false
 as o'erdyed blacks as wind as waters false
 as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
 no bourn twixt his and mine yet were it true
 to say this boy were like me come sir page
 look on me with your welkin eye sweet villain
 most dear'st my collop can thy dammay't be
 affection thy intention stabs the centre
 thou dost make possible things not so held
 communicatest with dreamshow can this be
 with what's unreal thou coactive art
 and fellow'st nothing then tis very credent
 thou mayst cojoin with something and thou dost
 and that beyond commission and i find it
 and that to the infection of my brains
 and hardening of my brows
polixenes what means sicilia
hermione he something seems unsettled
polixenes how my lord
 what cheer how is't with you best brother
hermione you look as if you held a brow of much distraction
 are you moved my lord
leontes no in good earnest
 how sometimes nature will betray its folly
 its tenderness and make itself a pastime
 to harder bosoms looking on the lines
 of my boy's face methoughts i did recoil
 twentythree years and saw myself unbreech'd
 in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled
 lest it should bite its master and so prove
 as ornaments oft do too dangerous
 how like methought i then was to this kernel
 this squash this gentleman mine honest friend
 will you take eggs for money
mamillius no my lord i'll fight
leontes you will why happy man be's dole my brother
 are you so fond of your young prince as we
 do seem to be of ours
polixenes if at home sir
 he's all my exercise my mirth my matter
 now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
 my parasite my soldier statesman all
 he makes a july's day short as december
 and with his varying childness cures in me
 thoughts that would thick my blood
leontes so stands this squire
 officed with me we two will walk my lord
 and leave you to your graver steps hermione
 how thou lovest us show in our brother's welcome
 let what is dear in sicily be cheap
 next to thyself and my young rover he's
 apparent to my heart
hermione if you would seek us
 we are yours i the garden shall's attend you there
leontes to your own bents dispose you you'll be found
 be you beneath the sky
 aside
 i am angling now
 though you perceive me not how i give line
 go to go to
 how she holds up the neb the bill to him
 and arms her with the boldness of a wife
 to her allowing husband
 exeunt polixenes hermione and attendants
 gone already
 inchthick kneedeep o'er head and
 ears a fork'd one
 go play boy play thy mother plays and i
 play too but so disgraced a part whose issue
 will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour
 will be my knell go play boy play
 there have been
 or i am much deceived cuckolds ere now
 and many a man there is even at this present
 now while i speak this holds his wife by the arm
 that little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
 and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by
 sir smile his neighbour nay there's comfort in't
 whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd
 as mine against their will should all despair
 that have revolted wives the tenth of mankind
 would hang themselves physic for't there is none
 it is a bawdy planet that will strike
 where tis predominant and tis powerful think it
 from east west north and south be it concluded
 no barricado for a belly know't
 it will let in and out the enemy
 with bag and baggage many thousand on's
 have the disease and feel't not how now boy
mamillius i am like you they say
leontes why that's some comfort what camillo there
camillo ay my good lord
leontes go play mamillius thou'rt an honest man
 exit mamillius
 camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
camillo you had much ado to make his anchor hold
 when you cast out it still came home
leontes didst note it
camillo he would not stay at your petitions made
 his business more material
leontes didst perceive it
 aside
 they're here with me already whispering rounding
 sicilia is a soforth tis far gone
 when i shall gust it last how came't camillo
 that he did stay
camillo at the good queen's entreaty
leontes at the queen's be't good should be pertinent
 but so it is it is not was this taken
 by any understanding pate but thine
 for thy conceit is soaking will draw in
 more than the common blocks not noted is't
 but of the finer natures by some severals
 of headpiece extraordinary lower messes
 perchance are to this business purblind say
camillo business my lord i think most understand
 bohemia stays here longer
leontes ha
camillo stays here longer
leontes ay but why
camillo to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
 of our most gracious mistress
leontes satisfy
 the entreaties of your mistress satisfy
 let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo
 with all the nearest things to my heart as well
 my chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou
 hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed
 thy penitent reform'd but we have been
 deceived in thy integrity deceived
 in that which seems so
camillo be it forbid my lord
leontes to bide upon't thou art not honest or
 if thou inclinest that way thou art a coward
 which hoxes honesty behind restraining
 from course required or else thou must be counted
 a servant grafted in my serious trust
 and therein negligent or else a fool
 that seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn
 and takest it all for jest
camillo my gracious lord
 i may be negligent foolish and fearful
 in every one of these no man is free
 but that his negligence his folly fear
 among the infinite doings of the world
 sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord
 if ever i were wilfulnegligent
 it was my folly if industriously
 i play'd the fool it was my negligence
 not weighing well the end if ever fearful
 to do a thing where i the issue doubted
 where of the execution did cry out
 against the nonperformance twas a fear
 which oft infects the wisest these my lord
 are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
 is never free of but beseech your grace
 be plainer with me let me know my trespass
 by its own visage if i then deny it
 tis none of mine
leontes ha not you seen camillo
 but that's past doubt you have or your eyeglass
 is thicker than a cuckold's hornor heard
 for to a vision so apparent rumour
 cannot be muteor thoughtfor cogitation
 resides not in that man that does not think
 my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess
 or else be impudently negative
 to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
 my wife's a hobbyhorse deserves a name
 as rank as any flaxwench that puts to
 before her trothplight say't and justify't
camillo i would not be a standerby to hear
 my sovereign mistress clouded so without
 my present vengeance taken shrew my heart
 you never spoke what did become you less
 than this which to reiterate were sin
 as deep as that though true
leontes is whispering nothing
 is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses
 kissing with inside lip stopping the career
 of laughing with a sigha note infallible
 of breaking honestyhorsing foot on foot
 skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
 hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
 blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
 that would unseen be wicked is this nothing
 why then the world and all that's in't is nothing
 the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing
 my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
 if this be nothing
camillo good my lord be cured
 of this diseased opinion and betimes
 for tis most dangerous
leontes say it be tis true
camillo no no my lord
leontes it is you lie you lie
 i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee
 pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
 or else a hovering temporizer that
 canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
 inclining to them both were my wife's liver
 infected as her life she would not live
 the running of one glass
camillo who does infect her
leontes why he that wears her like a medal hanging
 about his neck bohemia who if i
 had servants true about me that bare eyes
 to see alike mine honour as their profits
 their own particular thrifts they would do that
 which should undo more doing ay and thou
 his cupbearerwhom i from meaner form
 have benched and reared to worship who mayst see
 plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
 how i am galledmightst bespice a cup
 to give mine enemy a lasting wink
 which draught to me were cordial
camillo sir my lord
 i could do this and that with no rash potion
 but with a lingering dram that should not work
 maliciously like poison but i cannot
 believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
 so sovereignly being honourable
 i have loved thee
leontes make that thy question and go rot
 dost think i am so muddy so unsettled
 to appoint myself in this vexation sully
 the purity and whiteness of my sheets
 which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
 is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
 give scandal to the blood o the prince my son
 who i do think is mine and love as mine
 without ripe moving to't would i do this
 could man so blench
camillo i must believe you sir
 i do and will fetch off bohemia for't
 provided that when he's removed your highness
 will take again your queen as yours at first
 even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing
 the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
 known and allied to yours
leontes thou dost advise me
 even so as i mine own course have set down
 i'll give no blemish to her honour none
camillo my lord
 go then and with a countenance as clear
 as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia
 and with your queen i am his cupbearer
 if from me he have wholesome beverage
 account me not your servant
leontes this is all
 do't and thou hast the one half of my heart
 do't not thou split'st thine own
camillo i'll do't my lord
leontes i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me
 exit
camillo o miserable lady but for me
 what case stand i in i must be the poisoner
 of good polixenes and my ground to do't
 is the obedience to a master one
 who in rebellion with himself will have
 all that are his so too to do this deed
 promotion follows if i could find example
 of thousands that had struck anointed kings
 and flourish'd after i'ld not do't but since
 nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
 let villany itself forswear't i must
 forsake the court to do't or no is certain
 to me a breakneck happy star reign now
 here comes bohemia
 reenter polixenes
polixenes this is strange methinks
 my favour here begins to warp not speak
 good day camillo
camillo hail most royal sir
polixenes what is the news i the court
camillo none rare my lord
polixenes the king hath on him such a countenance
 as he had lost some province and a region
 loved as he loves himself even now i met him
 with customary compliment when he
 wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
 a lip of much contempt speeds from me and
 so leaves me to consider what is breeding
 that changeth thus his manners
camillo i dare not know my lord
polixenes how dare not do not do you know and dare not
 be intelligent to me tis thereabouts
 for to yourself what you do know you must
 and cannot say you dare not good camillo
 your changed complexions are to me a mirror
 which shows me mine changed too for i must be
 a party in this alteration finding
 myself thus alter'd with t
camillo there is a sickness
 which puts some of us in distemper but
 i cannot name the disease and it is caught
 of you that yet are well
polixenes how caught of me
 make me not sighted like the basilisk
 i have look'd on thousands who have sped the better
 by my regard but kill'd none so camillo
 as you are certainly a gentleman thereto
 clerklike experienced which no less adorns
 our gentry than our parents noble names
 in whose success we are gentlei beseech you
 if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
 thereof to be inform'd imprison't not
 in ignorant concealment
camillo i may not answer
polixenes a sickness caught of me and yet i well
 i must be answer'd dost thou hear camillo
 i conjure thee by all the parts of man
 which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
 is not this suit of mine that thou declare
 what incidency thou dost guess of harm
 is creeping toward me how far off how near
 which way to be prevented if to be
 if not how best to bear it
camillo sir i will tell you
 since i am charged in honour and by him
 that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel
 which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
 i mean to utter it or both yourself and me
 cry lost and so good night
polixenes on good camillo
camillo i am appointed him to murder you
polixenes by whom camillo
camillo by the king
polixenes for what
camillo he thinks nay with all confidence he swears
 as he had seen't or been an instrument
 to vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen
 forbiddenly
polixenes o then my best blood turn
 to an infected jelly and my name
 be yoked with his that did betray the best
 turn then my freshest reputation to
 a savour that may strike the dullest nostril
 where i arrive and my approach be shunn'd
 nay hated too worse than the great'st infection
 that e'er was heard or read
camillo swear his thought over
 by each particular star in heaven and
 by all their influences you may as well
 forbid the sea for to obey the moon
 as or by oath remove or counsel shake
 the fabric of his folly whose foundation
 is piled upon his faith and will continue
 the standing of his body
polixenes how should this grow
camillo i know not but i am sure tis safer to
 avoid what's grown than question how tis born
 if therefore you dare trust my honesty
 that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
 shall bear along impawn'd away tonight
 your followers i will whisper to the business
 and will by twos and threes at several posterns
 clear them o the city for myself i'll put
 my fortunes to your service which are here
 by this discovery lost be not uncertain
 for by the honour of my parents i
 have utter'd truth which if you seek to prove
 i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
 than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth thereon
 his execution sworn
polixenes i do believe thee
 i saw his heart in s face give me thy hand
 be pilot to me and thy places shall
 still neighbour mine my ships are ready and
 my people did expect my hence departure
 two days ago this jealousy
 is for a precious creature as she's rare
 must it be great and as his person's mighty
 must it be violent and as he does conceive
 he is dishonour'd by a man which ever
 profess'd to him why his revenges must
 in that be made more bitter fear o'ershades me
 good expedition be my friend and comfort
 the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing
 of his illta'en suspicion come camillo
 i will respect thee as a father if
 thou bear'st my life off hence let us avoid

mamillius no i'll none of you
first lady why my sweet lord
mamillius you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
 i were a baby still i love you better
second lady and why so my lord
mamillius not for because
 your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
 become some women best so that there be not
 too much hair there but in a semicircle
 or a halfmoon made with a pen
second lady who taught you this
mamillius i learnt it out of women's faces pray now
 what colour are your eyebrows
first lady blue my lord
mamillius nay that's a mock i have seen a lady's nose
 that has been blue but not her eyebrows
first lady hark ye
 the queen your mother rounds apace we shall
 present our services to a fine new prince
 one of these days and then you'ld wanton with us
 if we would have you
second lady she is spread of late
 into a goodly bulk good time encounter her
hermione what wisdom stirs amongst you come sir now
 i am for you again pray you sit by us
 and tell s a tale

hermione come on then
 and give't me in mine ear
 enter leontes with antigonus lords and others
leontes was he met there his train camillo with him
first lord behind the tuft of pines i met them never
 saw i men scour so on their way i eyed them
 even to their ships
leontes how blest am i
 in my just censure in my true opinion
 alack for lesser knowledge how accursed
 in being so blest there may be in the cup
 a spider steep'd and one may drink depart
 and yet partake no venom for his knowledge
 is not infected but if one present
 the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known
 how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
 with violent hefts i have drunk
 and seen the spider
 camillo was his help in this his pander
 there is a plot against my life my crown
 all's true that is mistrusted that false villain
 whom i employ'd was preemploy'd by him
 he has discover'd my design and i
 remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick
 for them to play at will how came the posterns
 so easily open
first lord by his great authority
 which often hath no less prevail'd than so
 on your command
leontes i know't too well
 give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him
 though he does bear some signs of me yet you
 have too much blood in him
hermione what is this sport
leontes bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
 away with him and let her sport herself
 with that she's big with for tis polixenes
 has made thee swell thus
hermione but i'ld say he had not
 and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying
 howe'er you lean to the nayward
leontes you my lords
 look on her mark her well be but about
 to say she is a goodly lady and
 the justice of your bearts will thereto add
 tis pity she's not honest honourable'
 praise her but for this her withoutdoor form
 which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
 the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
 that calumny doth useo i am out
 that mercy does for calumny will sear
 virtue itself these shrugs these hums and ha's
 when you have said she's goodly come between
 ere you can say she's honest but be t known
 from him that has most cause to grieve it should be
 she's an adulteress
hermione should a villain say so
 the most replenish'd villain in the world
 he were as much more villain you my lord
 do but mistake
leontes you have mistook my lady
 polixenes for leontes o thou thing
 which i'll not call a creature of thy place
 lest barbarism making me the precedent
 should a like language use to all degrees
 and mannerly distinguishment leave out
 betwixt the prince and beggar i have said
 she's an adulteress i have said with whom
 more she's a traitor and camillo is
 a federary with her and one that knows
 what she should shame to know herself
 but with her most vile principal that she's
 a bedswerver even as bad as those
 that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy
 to this their late escape
hermione no by my life
 privy to none of this how will this grieve you
 when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
 you thus have publish'd me gentle my lord
 you scarce can right me throughly then to say
 you did mistake
leontes no if i mistake
 in those foundations which i build upon
 the centre is not big enough to bear
 a schoolboy's top away with her to prison
 he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
 but that he speaks
hermione there's some ill planet reigns
 i must be patient till the heavens look
 with an aspect more favourable good my lords
 i am not prone to weeping as our sex
 commonly are the want of which vain dew
 perchance shall dry your pities but i have
 that honourable grief lodged here which burns
 worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords
 with thoughts so qualified as your charities
 shall best instruct you measure me and so
 the king's will be perform'd
leontes shall i be heard
hermione who is't that goes with me beseech your highness
 my women may be with me for you see
 my plight requires it do not weep good fools
 there is no cause when you shall know your mistress
 has deserved prison then abound in tears
 as i come out this action i now go on
 is for my better grace adieu my lord
 i never wish'd to see you sorry now
 i trust i shall my women come you have leave
leontes go do our bidding hence
 exit hermione guarded with ladies
first lord beseech your highness call the queen again
antigonus be certain what you do sir lest your justice
 prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
 yourself your queen your son
first lord for her my lord
 i dare my life lay down and will do't sir
 please you to accept it that the queen is spotless
 i the eyes of heaven and to you i mean
 in this which you accuse her
antigonus if it prove
 she's otherwise i'll keep my stables where
 i lodge my wife i'll go in couples with her
 than when i feel and see her no farther trust her
 for every inch of woman in the world
 ay every dram of woman's flesh is false if she be
leontes hold your peaces
first lord good my lord
antigonus it is for you we speak not for ourselves
 you are abused and by some putteron
 that will be damn'd for't would i knew the villain
 i would landdamn him be she honourflaw'd
 i have three daughters the eldest is eleven
 the second and the third nine and some five
 if this prove true they'll pay for't
 by mine honour
 i'll geld em all fourteen they shall not see
 to bring false generations they are coheirs
 and i had rather glib myself than they
 should not produce fair issue
leontes cease no more
 you smell this business with a sense as cold
 as is a dead man's nose but i do see't and feel't
 as you feel doing thus and see withal
 the instruments that feel
antigonus if it be so
 we need no grave to bury honesty
 there's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
 of the whole dungy earth
leontes what lack i credit
first lord i had rather you did lack than i my lord
 upon this ground and more it would content me
 to have her honour true than your suspicion
 be blamed for't how you might
leontes why what need we
 commune with you of this but rather follow
 our forceful instigation our prerogative
 calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
 imparts this which if you or stupefied
 or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
 relish a truth like us inform yourselves
 we need no more of your advice the matter
 the loss the gain the ordering on't is all
 properly ours
antigonus and i wish my liege
 you had only in your silent judgment tried it
 without more overture
leontes how could that be
 either thou art most ignorant by age
 or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight
 added to their familiarity
 which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture
 that lack'd sight only nought for approbation
 but only seeing all other circumstances
 made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding
 yet for a greater confirmation
 for in an act of this importance twere
 most piteous to be wild i have dispatch'd in post
 to sacred delphos to apollo's temple
 cleomenes and dion whom you know
 of stuff'd sufficiency now from the oracle
 they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
 shall stop or spur me have i done well
first lord well done my lord
leontes though i am satisfied and need no more
 than what i know yet shall the oracle
 give rest to the minds of others such as he
 whose ignorant credulity will not
 come up to the truth so have we thought it good
 from our free person she should be confined
 lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
 be left her to perform come follow us
 we are to speak in public for this business
 will raise us all
antigonus aside
 to laughter as i take it
 if the good truth were known

 which never tender lady hath born greater
 she is something before her time deliver'd
paulina a boy
emilia a daughter and a goodly babe

 much comfort in't says my poor prisoner

 if she dares trust me with her little babe
 i'll show't the king and undertake to be
 her advocate to the loud'st we do not know
 how he may soften at the sight o the child
 the silence often of pure innocence
 persuades when speaking fails
emilia most worthy madam
 your honour and your goodness is so evident
 that your free undertaking cannot miss
 a thriving issue there is no lady living
 so meet for this great errand please your ladyship
 to visit the next room i'll presently
 acquaint the queen of your most noble offer
 who but today hammer'd of this design
 but durst not tempt a minister of honour
 lest she should be denied
paulina tell her emilia
 i'll use that tongue i have if wit flow from't
 as boldness from my bosom let t not be doubted
 i shall do good
emilia now be you blest for it
 i'll to the queen please you
 come something nearer
gaoler madam if't please the queen to send the babe
 i know not what i shall incur to pass it
 having no warrant
paulina you need not fear it sir
 this child was prisoner to the womb and is
 by law and process of great nature thence
 freed and enfranchised not a party to
 the anger of the king nor guilty of
 if any be the trespass of the queen
gaoler i do believe it
paulina do not you fear upon mine honour
 i will stand betwixt you and danger

 the cause were not in beingpart o the cause

 is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank
 and level of my brain plotproof but she
 i can hook to me say that she were gone
 given to the fire a moiety of my rest
 might come to me again who's there
first servant my lord
leontes how does the boy
first servant he took good rest tonight
 tis hoped his sickness is discharged
leontes to see his nobleness
 conceiving the dishonour of his mother
 he straight declined droop'd took it deeply
 fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself
 threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
 and downright languish'd leave me solely go
 see how he fares
 exit servant
 fie fie no thought of him
 the thought of my revenges that way
 recoil upon me in himself too mighty
 and in his parties his alliance let him be
 until a time may serve for present vengeance
 take it on her camillo and polixenes
 laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
 they should not laugh if i could reach them nor
 shall she within my power
 enter paulina with a child
first lord you must not enter
paulina nay rather good my lords be second to me
 fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
 than the queen's life a gracious innocent soul
 more free than he is jealous
antigonus that's enough
second servant madam he hath not slept tonight commanded
 none should come at him
paulina not so hot good sir
 i come to bring him sleep tis such as you
 that creep like shadows by him and do sigh
 at each his needless heavings such as you
 nourish the cause of his awaking i
 do come with words as medicinal as true
 honest as either to purge him of that humour
 that presses him from sleep
leontes what noise there ho
paulina no noise my lord but needful conference
 about some gossips for your highness
leontes how
 away with that audacious lady antigonus
 i charged thee that she should not come about me
 i knew she would
antigonus i told her so my lord
 on your displeasure's peril and on mine
 she should not visit you
leontes what canst not rule her
paulina from all dishonesty he can in this
 unless he take the course that you have done
 commit me for committing honour trust it
 he shall not rule me
antigonus la you now you hear
 when she will take the rein i let her run
 but she'll not stumble
paulina good my liege i come
 and i beseech you hear me who profess
 myself your loyal servant your physician
 your most obedient counsellor yet that dare
 less appear so in comforting your evils
 than such as most seem yours i say i come
 from your good queen
leontes good queen
paulina good queen my lord
 good queen i say good queen
 and would by combat make her good so were i
 a man the worst about you
leontes force her hence
paulina let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
 first hand me on mine own accord i'll off
 but first i'll do my errand the good queen
 for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
 here tis commends it to your blessing
 laying down the child
leontes out
 a mankind witch hence with her out o door
 a most intelligencing bawd
paulina not so
 i am as ignorant in that as you
 in so entitling me and no less honest
 than you are mad which is enough i'll warrant
 as this world goes to pass for honest
leontes traitors
 will you not push her out give her the bastard
 thou dotard thou art womantired unroosted
 by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard
 take't up i say give't to thy crone
paulina for ever
 unvenerable be thy hands if thou
 takest up the princess by that forced baseness
 which he has put upon't
leontes he dreads his wife
paulina so i would you did then twere past all doubt
 you'ld call your children yours
leontes a nest of traitors
antigonus i am none by this good light
paulina nor i nor any
 but one that's here and that's himself for he
 the sacred honour of himself his queen's
 his hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander
 whose sting is sharper than the sword's
 and will not
 for as the case now stands it is a curse
 he cannot be compell'd to'tonce remove
 the root of his opinion which is rotten
 as ever oak or stone was sound
leontes a callat
 of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
 and now baits me this brat is none of mine
 it is the issue of polixenes
 hence with it and together with the dam
 commit them to the fire
paulina it is yours
 and might we lay the old proverb to your charge
 so like you tis the worse behold my lords
 although the print be little the whole matter
 and copy of the father eye nose lip
 the trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley
 the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek
 his smiles
 the very mould and frame of hand nail finger
 and thou good goddess nature which hast made it
 so like to him that got it if thou hast
 the ordering of the mind too mongst all colours
 no yellow in't lest she suspect as he does
 her children not her husband's
leontes a gross hag
 and lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd
 that wilt not stay her tongue
antigonus hang all the husbands
 that cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself
 hardly one subject
leontes once more take her hence
paulina a most unworthy and unnatural lord
 can do no more
leontes i'll ha thee burnt
paulina i care not
 it is an heretic that makes the fire
 not she which burns in't i'll not call you tyrant
 but this most cruel usage of your queen
 not able to produce more accusation
 than your own weakhinged fancy something savours
 of tyranny and will ignoble make you
 yea scandalous to the world
leontes on your allegiance
 out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant
 where were her life she durst not call me so
 if she did know me one away with her
paulina i pray you do not push me i'll be gone
 look to your babe my lord tis yours
 jove send her
 a better guiding spirit what needs these hands
 you that are thus so tender o'er his follies
 will never do him good not one of you
 so so farewell we are gone
 exit
leontes thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
 my child away with't even thou that hast
 a heart so tender o'er it take it hence
 and see it instantly consumed with fire
 even thou and none but thou take it up straight
 within this hour bring me word tis done
 and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life
 with what thou else call'st thine if thou refuse
 and wilt encounter with my wrath say so
 the bastard brains with these my proper hands
 shall i dash out go take it to the fire
 for thou set'st on thy wife
antigonus i did not sir
 these lords my noble fellows if they please
 can clear me in't
lords we can my royal liege
 he is not guilty of her coming hither
leontes you're liars all
first lord beseech your highness give us better credit
 we have always truly served you and beseech you
 so to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
 as recompense of our dear services
 past and to come that you do change this purpose
 which being so horrible so bloody must
 lead on to some foul issue we all kneel
leontes i am a feather for each wind that blows
 shall i live on to see this bastard kneel
 and call me father better burn it now
 than curse it then but be it let it live
 it shall not neither you sir come you hither
 you that have been so tenderly officious
 with lady margery your midwife there
 to save this bastard's lifefor tis a bastard
 so sure as this beard's grey
 what will you adventure
 to save this brat's life
antigonus any thing my lord
 that my ability may undergo
 and nobleness impose at least thus much
 i'll pawn the little blood which i have left
 to save the innocent any thing possible
leontes it shall be possible swear by this sword
 thou wilt perform my bidding
antigonus i will my lord
leontes mark and perform it see'st thou for the fail
 of any point in't shall not only be
 death to thyself but to thy lewdtongued wife
 whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee
 as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
 this female bastard hence and that thou bear it
 to some remote and desert place quite out
 of our dominions and that there thou leave it
 without more mercy to its own protection
 and favour of the climate as by strange fortune
 it came to us i do in justice charge thee
 on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture
 that thou commend it strangely to some place
 where chance may nurse or end it take it up
antigonus i swear to do this though a present death
 had been more merciful come on poor babe
 some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
 to be thy nurses wolves and bears they say
 casting their savageness aside have done
 like offices of pity sir be prosperous
 in more than this deed does require and blessing
 against this cruelty fight on thy side

 of us too much beloved let us be clear'd
 of being tyrannous since we so openly
 proceed in justice which shall have due course
 even to the guilt or the purgation

officer it is his highness pleasure that the queen
 appear in person here in court silence
 enter hermione guarded
 paulina and ladies attending
leontes read the indictment
officer reads hermione queen to the worthy
 leontes king of sicilia thou art here accused and
 arraigned of high treason in committing adultery
 with polixenes king of bohemia and conspiring
 with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
 lord the king thy royal husband the pretence
 whereof being by circumstances partly laid open
 thou hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance
 of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for
 their better safety to fly away by night
hermione since what i am to say must be but that
 which contradicts my accusation and
 the testimony on my part no other
 but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
 to say not guilty mine integrity
 being counted falsehood shall as i express it
 be so received but thus if powers divine
 behold our human actions as they do
 i doubt not then but innocence shall make
 false accusation blush and tyranny
 tremble at patience you my lord best know
 who least will seem to do so my past life
 hath been as continent as chaste as true
 as i am now unhappy which is more
 than history can pattern though devised
 and play'd to take spectators for behold me
 a fellow of the royal bed which owe
 a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter
 the mother to a hopeful prince here standing
 to prate and talk for life and honour fore
 who please to come and hear for life i prize it
 as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour
 tis a derivative from me to mine
 and only that i stand for i appeal
 to your own conscience sir before polixenes
 came to your court how i was in your grace
 how merited to be so since he came
 with what encounter so uncurrent i
 have strain'd to appear thus if one jot beyond
 the bound of honour or in act or will
 that way inclining harden'd be the hearts
 of all that hear me and my near'st of kin
 cry fie upon my grave
leontes i ne'er heard yet
 that any of these bolder vices wanted
 less impudence to gainsay what they did
 than to perform it first
hermione that's true enough
 through tis a saying sir not due to me
leontes you will not own it
hermione more than mistress of
 which comes to me in name of fault i must not
 at all acknowledge for polixenes
 with whom i am accused i do confess
 i loved him as in honour he required
 with such a kind of love as might become
 a lady like me with a love even such
 so and no other as yourself commanded
 which not to have done i think had been in me
 both disobedience and ingratitude
 to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
 even since it could speak from an infant freely
 that it was yours now for conspiracy
 i know not how it tastes though it be dish'd
 for me to try how all i know of it
 is that camillo was an honest man
 and why he left your court the gods themselves
 wotting no more than i are ignorant
leontes you knew of his departure as you know
 what you have underta'en to do in's absence
hermione sir
 you speak a language that i understand not
 my life stands in the level of your dreams
 which i'll lay down
leontes your actions are my dreams
 you had a bastard by polixenes
 and i but dream'd it as you were past all shame
 those of your fact are soso past all truth
 which to deny concerns more than avails for as
 thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
 no father owning itwhich is indeed
 more criminal in thee than itso thou
 shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
 look for no less than death
hermione sir spare your threats
 the bug which you would fright me with i seek
 to me can life be no commodity
 the crown and comfort of my life your favour
 i do give lost for i do feel it gone
 but know not how it went my second joy
 and firstfruits of my body from his presence
 i am barr'd like one infectious my third comfort
 starr'd most unluckily is from my breast
 the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth
 haled out to murder myself on every post
 proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred
 the childbed privilege denied which longs
 to women of all fashion lastly hurried
 here to this place i the open air before
 i have got strength of limit now my liege
 tell me what blessings i have here alive
 that i should fear to die therefore proceed
 but yet hear this mistake me not no life
 i prize it not a straw but for mine honour
 which i would free if i shall be condemn'd
 upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
 but what your jealousies awake i tell you
 tis rigor and not law your honours all
 i do refer me to the oracle
 apollo be my judge
first lord this your request
 is altogether just therefore bring forth
 and in apollos name his oracle
 exeunt certain officers
hermione the emperor of russia was my father
 o that he were alive and here beholding
 his daughter's trial that he did but see
 the flatness of my misery yet with eyes
 of pity not revenge
 reenter officers with cleomenes and dion
officer you here shall swear upon this sword of justice
 that you cleomenes and dion have
 been both at delphos and from thence have brought
 the seal'dup oracle by the hand deliver'd
 of great apollo's priest and that since then
 you have not dared to break the holy seal

leontes break up the seals and read
officer reads hermione is chaste
 polixenes blameless camillo a true subject leontes
 a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten
 and the king shall live without an heir if that
 which is lost be not found
lords now blessed be the great apollo
hermione praised
leontes hast thou read truth
officer ay my lord even so
 as it is here set down
leontes there is no truth at all i the oracle
 the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood
 enter servant
servant my lord the king the king
leontes what is the business
servant o sir i shall be hated to report it
 the prince your son with mere conceit and fear
 of the queen's speed is gone
leontes how gone
servant is dead
leontes apollo's angry and the heavens themselves
 do strike at my injustice
 hermione swoons
 how now there
paulina this news is mortal to the queen look down
 and see what death is doing
leontes take her hence
 her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover
 i have too much believed mine own suspicion
 beseech you tenderly apply to her
 some remedies for life
 exeunt paulina and ladies with hermione
 apollo pardon
 my great profaneness gainst thine oracle
 i'll reconcile me to polixenes
 new woo my queen recall the good camillo
 whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy
 for being transported by my jealousies
 to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose
 camillo for the minister to poison
 my friend polixenes which had been done
 but that the good mind of camillo tardied
 my swift command though i with death and with
 reward did threaten and encourage him
 not doing t and being done he most humane
 and fill'd with honour to my kingly guest
 unclasp'd my practise quit his fortunes here
 which you knew great and to the hazard
 of all encertainties himself commended
 no richer than his honour how he glisters
 thorough my rust and how his pity
 does my deeds make the blacker
 reenter paulina
paulina woe the while
 o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
 break too
first lord what fit is this good lady
paulina what studied torments tyrant hast for me
 what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
 in leads or oils what old or newer torture
 must i receive whose every word deserves
 to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny
 together working with thy jealousies
 fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
 for girls of nine o think what they have done
 and then run mad indeed stark mad for all
 thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it
 that thou betray'dst polixenes'twas nothing
 that did but show thee of a fool inconstant
 and damnable ingrateful nor was't much
 thou wouldst have poison'd good camillo's honour
 to have him kill a king poor trespasses
 more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon
 the casting forth to crows thy babydaughter
 to be or none or little though a devil
 would have shed water out of fire ere done't
 nor is't directly laid to thee the death
 of the young prince whose honourable thoughts
 thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
 that could conceive a gross and foolish sire
 blemish'd his gracious dam this is not no
 laid to thy answer but the lasto lords
 when i have said cry woe the queen the queen
 the sweet'st dear'st creature's dead
 and vengeance for't
 not dropp'd down yet
first lord the higher powers forbid
paulina i say she's dead i'll swear't if word nor oath
 prevail not go and see if you can bring
 tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
 heat outwardly or breath within i'll serve you
 as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant
 do not repent these things for they are heavier
 than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
 to nothing but despair a thousand knees
 ten thousand years together naked fasting
 upon a barren mountain and still winter
 in storm perpetual could not move the gods
 to look that way thou wert
leontes go on go on
 thou canst not speak too much i have deserved
 all tongues to talk their bitterest
first lord say no more
 howe'er the business goes you have made fault
 i the boldness of your speech
paulina i am sorry for't
 all faults i make when i shall come to know them
 i do repent alas i have show'd too much
 the rashness of a woman he is touch'd
 to the noble heart what's gone and what's past help
 should be past grief do not receive affliction
 at my petition i beseech you rather
 let me be punish'd that have minded you
 of what you should forget now good my liege
 sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
 the love i bore your queenlo fool again
 i'll speak of her no more nor of your children
 i'll not remember you of my own lord
 who is lost too take your patience to you
 and i'll say nothing
leontes thou didst speak but well
 when most the truth which i receive much better
 than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me
 to the dead bodies of my queen and son
 one grave shall be for both upon them shall
 the causes of their death appear unto
 our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit
 the chapel where they lie and tears shed there
 shall be my recreation so long as nature
 will bear up with this exercise so long
 i daily vow to use it come and lead me
 unto these sorrows

antigonus thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon
 the deserts of bohemia
mariner ay my lord and fear
 we have landed in ill time the skies look grimly
 and threaten present blusters in my conscience
 the heavens with that we have in hand are angry
 and frown upon s
antigonus their sacred wills be done go get aboard
 look to thy bark i'll not be long before
 i call upon thee
mariner make your best haste and go not
 too far i the land tis like to be loud weather
 besides this place is famous for the creatures
 of prey that keep upon't
antigonus go thou away
 i'll follow instantly
mariner i am glad at heart
 to be so rid o the business

antigonus come poor babe
 i have heard but not believed
 the spirits o the dead
 may walk again if such thing be thy mother
 appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream
 so like a waking to me comes a creature
 sometimes her head on one side some another
 i never saw a vessel of like sorrow
 so fill'd and so becoming in pure white robes
 like very sanctity she did approach
 my cabin where i lay thrice bow'd before me
 and gasping to begin some speech her eyes
 became two spouts the fury spent anon
 did this breakfrom her good antigonus
 since fate against thy better disposition
 hath made thy person for the throwerout
 of my poor babe according to thine oath
 places remote enough are in bohemia
 there weep and leave it crying and for the babe
 is counted lost for ever perdita
 i prithee call't for this ungentle business
 put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see
 thy wife paulina more and so with shrieks
 she melted into air affrighted much
 i did in time collect myself and thought
 this was so and no slumber dreams are toys
 yet for this once yea superstitiously
 i will be squared by this i do believe
 hermione hath suffer'd death and that
 apollo would this being indeed the issue
 of king polixenes it should here be laid
 either for life or death upon the earth
 of its right father blossom speed thee well
 there lie and there thy character there these
 which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
 and still rest thine the storm begins poor wretch
 that for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
 to loss and what may follow weep i cannot
 but my heart bleeds and most accursed am i
 to be by oath enjoin'd to this farewell

 sky betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust

shepherd why boy how is it
clown i would you did but see how it chafes how it rages
 how it takes up the shore but that's not the
 point o the most piteous cry of the poor souls
 sometimes to see em and not to see em now the
 ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon
 swallowed with yest and froth as you'ld thrust a
 cork into a hogshead and then for the
 landservice to see how the bear tore out his
 shoulderbone how he cried to me for help and said
 his name was antigonus a nobleman but to make an
 end of the ship to see how the sea flapdragoned
 it but first how the poor souls roared and the
 sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared
 and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than
 the sea or weather
shepherd name of mercy when was this boy
clown now now i have not winked since i saw these
 sights the men are not yet cold under water nor
 the bear half dined on the gentleman he's at it

 the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
 that he shuts up himself imagine me
 gentle spectators that i now may be

scene ii bohemia the palace of polixenes
 enter polixenes and camillo
polixenes i pray thee good camillo be no more importunate
 tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to
 grant this
camillo it is fifteen years since i saw my country though
 i have for the most part been aired abroad i
 desire to lay my bones there besides the penitent
 king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling
 sorrows i might be some allay or i o'erween to
 think so which is another spur to my departure
polixenes as thou lovest me camillo wipe not out the rest of
 thy services by leaving me now the need i have of
 thee thine own goodness hath made better not to
 have had thee than thus to want thee thou having
 made me businesses which none without thee can
 sufficiently manage must either stay to execute
 them thyself or take away with thee the very
 services thou hast done which if i have not enough
 considered as too much i cannot to be more
 thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit
 therein the heaping friendships of that fatal
 country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very
 naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
 penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king
 my brother whose loss of his most precious queen
 and children are even now to be afresh lamented
 say to me when sawest thou the prince florizel my
 son kings are no less unhappy their issue not
 being gracious than they are in losing them when
 they have approved their virtues
camillo sir it is three days since i saw the prince what
 his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i
 have missingly noted he is of late much retired
 from court and is less frequent to his princely
 exercises than formerly he hath appeared
polixenes i have considered so much camillo and with some
 care so far that i have eyes under my service which
 look upon his removedness from whom i have this
 intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a
 most homely shepherd a man they say that from
 very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
 neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
camillo i have heard sir of such a man who hath a
 daughter of most rare note the report of her is
 extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage
polixenes that's likewise part of my intelligence but i
 fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou
 shalt accompany us to the place where we will not
 appearing what we are have some question with the
 shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not
 uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither
 prithee be my present partner in this business and
 lay aside the thoughts of sicilia
camillo i willingly obey your command
polixenes my best camillo we must disguise ourselves

 out of the court they cherish it to make it stay
 there and yet it will no more but abide
autolycus vices i would say sir i know this man well he
 hath been since an apebearer then a
 processserver a bailiff then he compassed a
 motion of the prodigal son and married a tinker's
 wife within a mile where my land and living lies

 settled only in rogue some call him autolycus

florizel these your unusual weeds to each part of you
 do give a life no shepherdess but flora
 peering in april's front this your sheepshearing
 is as a meeting of the petty gods
 and you the queen on't
perdita sir my gracious lord
 to chide at your extremes it not becomes me
 o pardon that i name them your high self
 the gracious mark o the land you have obscured
 with a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid
 most goddesslike prank'd up but that our feasts
 in every mess have folly and the feeders
 digest it with a custom i should blush
 to see you so attired sworn i think
 to show myself a glass
florizel i bless the time
 when my good falcon made her flight across
 thy father's ground
perdita now jove afford you cause
 to me the difference forges dread your greatness
 hath not been used to fear even now i tremble
 to think your father by some accident
 should pass this way as you did o the fates
 how would he look to see his work so noble
 vilely bound up what would he say or how
 should i in these my borrow'd flaunts behold
 the sternness of his presence
florizel apprehend
 nothing but jollity the gods themselves
 humbling their deities to love have taken
 the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter
 became a bull and bellow'd the green neptune
 a ram and bleated and the firerobed god
 golden apollo a poor humble swain
 as i seem now their transformations
 were never for a piece of beauty rarer
 nor in a way so chaste since my desires
 run not before mine honour nor my lusts
 burn hotter than my faith
perdita o but sir
 your resolution cannot hold when tis
 opposed as it must be by the power of the king
 one of these two must be necessities
 which then will speak that you must
 change this purpose
 or i my life
florizel thou dearest perdita
 with these forced thoughts i prithee darken not
 the mirth o the feast or i'll be thine my fair
 or not my father's for i cannot be
 mine own nor any thing to any if
 i be not thine to this i am most constant
 though destiny say no be merry gentle
 strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
 that you behold the while your guests are coming
 lift up your countenance as it were the day

 flowers o the season

 which some call nature's bastards of that kind
 our rustic garden's barren and i care not
 to get slips of them
polixenes wherefore gentle maiden
 do you neglect them
perdita for i have heard it said
 there is an art which in their piedness shares
 with great creating nature
polixenes say there be
 yet nature is made better by no mean
 but nature makes that mean so over that art
 which you say adds to nature is an art
 that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry
 a gentler scion to the wildest stock
 and make conceive a bark of baser kind
 by bud of nobler race this is an art
 which does mend nature change it rather but
 the art itself is nature
perdita so it is
polixenes then make your garden rich in gillyvors
 and do not call them bastards
perdita i'll not put
 the dibble in earth to set one slip of them
 no more than were i painted i would wish
 this youth should say twere well and only therefore
 desire to breed by me here's flowers for you
 hot lavender mints savoury marjoram
 the marigold that goes to bed wi the sun
 and with him rises weeping these are flowers
 of middle summer and i think they are given
 to men of middle age you're very welcome
camillo i should leave grazing were i of your flock

perdita out alas
 you'd be so lean that blasts of january
 would blow you through and through

 become your time of day and yours and yours
 that wear upon your virgin branches yet
 your maidenheads growing o proserpina
 for the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall
 from dis's waggon daffodils
 that come before the swallow dares and take
 the winds of march with beauty violets dim
 but sweeter than the lids of juno's eyes
 or cytherea's breath pale primroses

 bight phoebus in his strengtha malady
 most incident to maids bold oxlips and
 the crown imperial lilies of all kinds
 the flowerdeluce being one o these i lack

perdita no like a bank for love to lie and play on
 not like a corse or if not to be buried
 but quick and in mine arms come take your flowers
 methinks i play as i have seen them do
 in whitsun pastorals sure this robe of mine
 does change my disposition
florizel what you do
 still betters what is done when you speak sweet
 i'ld have you do it ever when you sing
 i'ld have you buy and sell so so give alms
 pray so and for the ordering your affairs
 to sing them too when you do dance i wish you
 a wave o the sea that you might ever do
 nothing but that move still still so
 and own no other function each your doing
 so singular in each particular
 crowns what you are doing in the present deed
 that all your acts are queens
perdita o doricles
 your praises are too large but that your youth
 and the true blood which peepeth fairly through't
 do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd
 with wisdom i might fear my doricles
 you woo'd me the false way
florizel i think you have
 as little skill to fear as i have purpose
 to put you to't but come our dance i pray
 your hand my perdita so turtles pair
 that never mean to part
perdita i'll swear for em
polixenes this is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever
 ran on the greensward nothing she does or seems
 but smacks of something greater than herself
 too noble for this place
camillo he tells her something
 that makes her blood look out good sooth she is
 the queen of curds and cream
clown come on strike up
dorcas mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic

 shepherdesses
polixenes pray good shepherd what fair swain is this
 which dances with your daughter
shepherd they call him doricles and boasts himself
 to have a worthy feeding but i have it
 upon his own report and i believe it
 he looks like sooth he says he loves my daughter
 i think so too for never gazed the moon
 upon the water as he'll stand and read
 as twere my daughter's eyes and to be plain
 i think there is not half a kiss to choose
 who loves another best
polixenes she dances featly
shepherd so she does any thing though i report it
 that should be silent if young doricles
 do light upon her she shall bring him that
 which he not dreams of
 enter servant
servant o master if you did but hear the pedlar at the
 door you would never dance again after a tabour and
 pipe no the bagpipe could not move you he sings
 several tunes faster than you'll tell money he
 utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
 ears grew to his tunes
clown he could never come better he shall come in i
 love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful
 matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing
 indeed and sung lamentably
servant he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no
 milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he
 has the prettiest lovesongs for maids so without
 bawdry which is strange with such delicate
 burthens of dildos and fadings jump her and thump
 her and where some stretchmouthed rascal would
 as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into
 the matter he makes the maid to answer whoop do me
 no harm good man puts him off slights him with
 whoop do me no harm good man'
polixenes this is a brave fellow
clown believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited
 fellow has he any unbraided wares
servant he hath ribbons of an the colours i the rainbow
 points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can
 learnedly handle though they come to him by the
 gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns why he
 sings em over as they were gods or goddesses you
 would think a smock were a sheangel he so chants
 to the sleevehand and the work about the square on't
clown prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
perdita forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in s tunes

 themselves all men of hair they call themselves
 saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches
 say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are
 not in't but they themselves are o the mind if it
 be not too rough for some that know little but
 bowling it will please plentifully
shepherd away we'll none on t here has been too much
 homely foolery already i know sir we weary you
polixenes you weary those that refresh us pray let's see
 these four threes of herdsmen
servant one three of them by their own report sir hath
 danced before the king and not the worst of the
 three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier
shepherd leave your prating since these good men are
 pleased let them come in but quickly now
servant why they stay at door sir
 exit
 here a dance of twelve satyrs
polixenes o father you'll know more of that hereafter
 to camillo
 is it not too far gone tis time to part them
 he's simple and tells much
 to florizel
 how now fair shepherd
 your heart is full of something that does take
 your mind from feasting sooth when i was young
 and handed love as you do i was wont
 to load my she with knacks i would have ransack'd
 the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
 to her acceptance you have let him go
 and nothing marted with him if your lass
 interpretation should abuse and call this
 your lack of love or bounty you were straited
 for a reply at least if you make a care
 of happy holding her
florizel old sir i know
 she prizes not such trifles as these are
 the gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
 up in my heart which i have given already
 but not deliver'd o hear me breathe my life
 before this ancient sir who it should seem
 hath sometime loved i take thy hand this hand
 as soft as dove's down and as white as it
 or ethiopian's tooth or the fann'd
 snow that's bolted
 by the northern blasts twice o'er
polixenes what follows this
 how prettily the young swain seems to wash
 the hand was fair before i have put you out
 but to your protestation let me hear
 what you profess
florizel do and be witness to t
polixenes and this my neighbour too
florizel and he and more
 than he and men the earth the heavens and all
 that were i crown'd the most imperial monarch
 thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth
 that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
 more than was ever man's i would not prize them
 without her love for her employ them all
 commend them and condemn them to her service
 or to their own perdition
polixenes fairly offer'd
camillo this shows a sound affection
shepherd but my daughter
 say you the like to him
perdita i cannot speak
 so well nothing so well no nor mean better
 by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out
 the purity of his
shepherd take hands a bargain
 and friends unknown you shall bear witness to t
 i give my daughter to him and will make
 her portion equal his
florizel o that must be
 i the virtue of your daughter one being dead
 i shall have more than you can dream of yet
 enough then for your wonder but come on
 contract us fore these witnesses
shepherd come your hand
 and daughter yours
polixenes soft swain awhile beseech you
 have you a father
florizel i have but what of him
polixenes knows he of this
florizel he neither does nor shall
polixenes methinks a father
 is at the nuptial of his son a guest
 that best becomes the table pray you once more
 is not your father grown incapable
 of reasonable affairs is he not stupid
 with age and altering rheums can he speak hear
 know man from man dispute his own estate
 lies he not bedrid and again does nothing
 but what he did being childish
florizel no good sir
 he has his health and ampler strength indeed
 than most have of his age
polixenes by my white beard
 you offer him if this be so a wrong
 something unfilial reason my son
 should choose himself a wife but as good reason
 the father all whose joy is nothing else
 but fair posterity should hold some counsel
 in such a business
florizel i yield all this
 but for some other reasons my grave sir
 which tis not fit you know i not acquaint
 my father of this business
polixenes let him know't
florizel he shall not
polixenes prithee let him
florizel no he must not
shepherd let him my son he shall not need to grieve
 at knowing of thy choice
florizel come come he must not
 mark our contract
polixenes mark your divorce young sir
 discovering himself
 whom son i dare not call thou art too base
 to be acknowledged thou a sceptre's heir
 that thus affect'st a sheephook thou old traitor
 i am sorry that by hanging thee i can
 but shorten thy life one week and thou fresh piece
 of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
 the royal fool thou copest with
shepherd o my heart
polixenes i'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made
 more homely than thy state for thee fond boy
 if i may ever know thou dost but sigh
 that thou no more shalt see this knack as never
 i mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession
 not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
 far than deucalion off mark thou my words
 follow us to the court thou churl for this time
 though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
 from the dead blow of it and you enchantment
 worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
 that makes himself but for our honour therein
 unworthy theeif ever henceforth thou
 these rural latches to his entrance open
 or hoop his body more with thy embraces
 i will devise a death as cruel for thee
 as thou art tender to't
 exit
perdita even here undone
 i was not much afeard for once or twice
 i was about to speak and tell him plainly
 the selfsame sun that shines upon his court
 hides not his visage from our cottage but
 looks on alike will't please you sir be gone
 i told you what would come of this beseech you
 of your own state take care this dream of mine
 being now awake i'll queen it no inch farther
 but milk my ewes and weep
camillo why how now father
 speak ere thou diest
shepherd i cannot speak nor think
 nor dare to know that which i know o sir
 you have undone a man of fourscore three
 that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
 to die upon the bed my father died
 to lie close by his honest bones but now
 some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
 where no priest shovels in dust o cursed wretch
 that knew'st this was the prince
 and wouldst adventure
 to mingle faith with him undone undone
 if i might die within this hour i have lived
 to die when i desire
 exit
florizel why look you so upon me
 i am but sorry not afeard delay'd
 but nothing alter'd what i was i am
 more straining on for plucking back not following
 my leash unwillingly
camillo gracious my lord
 you know your father's temper at this time
 he will allow no speech which i do guess
 you do not purpose to him and as hardly
 will he endure your sight as yet i fear
 then till the fury of his highness settle
 come not before him
florizel i not purpose it
 i think camillo
camillo even he my lord
perdita how often have i told you twould be thus
 how often said my dignity would last
 but till twere known
florizel it cannot fail but by
 the violation of my faith and then
 let nature crush the sides o the earth together
 and mar the seeds within lift up thy looks
 from my succession wipe me father i
 am heir to my affection
camillo be advised
florizel i am and by my fancy if my reason
 will thereto be obedient i have reason
 if not my senses better pleased with madness
 do bid it welcome
camillo this is desperate sir
florizel so call it but it does fulfil my vow
 i needs must think it honesty camillo
 not for bohemia nor the pomp that may
 be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or
 the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
 in unknown fathoms will i break my oath
 to this my fair beloved therefore i pray you
 as you have ever been my father's honour'd friend
 when he shall miss meas in faith i mean not
 to see him any morecast your good counsels
 upon his passion let myself and fortune
 tug for the time to come this you may know
 and so deliver i am put to sea
 with her whom here i cannot hold on shore
 and most opportune to our need i have
 a vessel rides fast by but not prepared
 for this design what course i mean to hold
 shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
 concern me the reporting
camillo o my lord
 i would your spirit were easier for advice
 or stronger for your need
florizel hark perdita
 drawing her aside
 i'll hear you by and by
camillo he's irremoveable
 resolved for flight now were i happy if
 his going i could frame to serve my turn
 save him from danger do him love and honour
 purchase the sight again of dear sicilia
 and that unhappy king my master whom
 i so much thirst to see
florizel now good camillo
 i am so fraught with curious business that
 i leave out ceremony
camillo sir i think
 you have heard of my poor services i the love
 that i have borne your father
florizel very nobly
 have you deserved it is my father's music
 to speak your deeds not little of his care
 to have them recompensed as thought on
camillo well my lord
 if you may please to think i love the king
 and through him what is nearest to him which is
 your gracious self embrace but my direction
 if your more ponderous and settled project
 may suffer alteration on mine honour
 i'll point you where you shall have such receiving
 as shall become your highness where you may
 enjoy your mistress from the whom i see
 there's no disjunction to be made but by
 as heavens forefendyour ruin marry her
 and with my best endeavours in your absence
 your discontenting father strive to qualify
 and bring him up to liking
florizel how camillo
 may this almost a miracle be done
 that i may call thee something more than man
 and after that trust to thee
camillo have you thought on
 a place whereto you'll go
florizel not any yet
 but as the unthoughton accident is guilty
 to what we wildly do so we profess
 ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
 of every wind that blows
camillo then list to me
 this follows if you will not change your purpose
 but undergo this flight make for sicilia
 and there present yourself and your fair princess
 for so i see she must be fore leontes
 she shall be habited as it becomes
 the partner of your bed methinks i see
 leontes opening his free arms and weeping
 his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness
 as twere i the father's person kisses the hands
 of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him
 twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one
 he chides to hell and bids the other grow
 faster than thought or time
florizel worthy camillo
 what colour for my visitation shall i
 hold up before him
camillo sent by the king your father
 to greet him and to give him comforts sir
 the manner of your bearing towards him with
 what you as from your father shall deliver
 things known betwixt us three i'll write you down
 the which shall point you forth at every sitting
 what you must say that he shall not perceive
 but that you have your father's bosom there
 and speak his very heart
florizel i am bound to you
 there is some sap in this
camillo a cause more promising
 than a wild dedication of yourselves
 to unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain
 to miseries enough no hope to help you
 but as you shake off one to take another
 nothing so certain as your anchors who
 do their best office if they can but stay you
 where you'll be loath to be besides you know
 prosperity's the very bond of love
 whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
 affliction alters
perdita one of these is true
 i think affliction may subdue the cheek
 but not take in the mind
camillo yea say you so
 there shall not at your father's house these
 seven years
 be born another such
florizel my good camillo
 she is as forward of her breeding as
 she is i the rear our birth
camillo i cannot say tis pity
 she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
 to most that teach
perdita your pardon sir for this
 i'll blush you thanks
florizel my prettiest perdita
 but o the thorns we stand upon camillo
 preserver of my father now of me
 the medicine of our house how shall we do
 we are not furnish'd like bohemia's son
 nor shall appear in sicilia
camillo my lord
 fear none of this i think you know my fortunes
 do all lie there it shall be so my care
 to have you royally appointed as if
 the scene you play were mine for instance sir
 that you may know you shall not want one word
 they talk aside
 reenter autolycus
autolycus ha ha what a fool honesty is and trust his
 sworn brother a very simple gentleman i have sold
 all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a
 ribbon glass pomander brooch tablebook ballad
 knife tape glove shoetie bracelet hornring
 to keep my pack from fasting they throng who
 should buy first as if my trinkets had been
 hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer
 by which means i saw whose purse was best in
 picture and what i saw to my good use i
 remembered my clown who wants but something to
 be a reasonable man grew so in love with the
 wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes
 till he had both tune and words which so drew the
 rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
 stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it
 was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
 purse i could have filed keys off that hung in
 chains no hearing no feeling but my sir's song
 and admiring the nothing of it so that in this
 time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their
 festival purses and had not the old man come in
 with a whoobub against his daughter and the king's
 son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not
 left a purse alive in the whole army
 camillo florizel and perdita come forward
camillo nay but my letters by this means being there
 so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
florizel and those that you'll procure from king leontes
camillo shall satisfy your father
perdita happy be you
 all that you speak shows fair
camillo who have we here
 seeing autolycus
 we'll make an instrument of this omit
 nothing may give us aid
autolycus if they have overheard me now why hanging
camillo how now good fellow why shakest thou so fear
 not man here's no harm intended to thee
autolycus i am a poor fellow sir
camillo why be so still here's nobody will steal that from
 thee yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
 make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly
 thou must think there's a necessity in'tand
 change garments with this gentleman though the
 pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee
 there's some boot
autolycus i am a poor fellow sir
 aside
 i know ye well enough
camillo nay prithee dispatch the gentleman is half
 flayed already
autolycus are you in earnest sir
 aside
 i smell the trick on't
florizel dispatch i prithee
autolycus indeed i have had earnest but i cannot with
 conscience take it
camillo unbuckle unbuckle
 florizel and autolycus exchange garments
 fortunate mistresslet my prophecy
 come home to yeyou must retire yourself
 into some covert take your sweetheart's hat
 and pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face
 dismantle you and as you can disliken
 the truth of your own seeming that you may
 for i do fear eyes overto shipboard
 get undescried
perdita i see the play so lies
 that i must bear a part
camillo no remedy
 have you done there
florizel should i now meet my father
 he would not call me son
camillo nay you shall have no hat
 giving it to perdita
 come lady come farewell my friend
autolycus adieu sir
florizel o perdita what have we twain forgot
 pray you a word
camillo aside what i do next shall be to tell the king
 of this escape and whither they are bound
 wherein my hope is i shall so prevail
 to force him after in whose company
 i shall review sicilia for whose sight
 i have a woman's longing
florizel fortune speed us
 thus we set on camillo to the seaside
camillo the swifter speed the better
 exeunt florizel perdita and camillo
autolycus i understand the business i hear it to have an
 open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is
 necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite
 also to smell out work for the other senses i see
 this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive
 what an exchange had this been without boot what
 a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do
 this year connive at us and we may do any thing
 extempore the prince himself is about a piece of
 iniquity stealing away from his father with his
 clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of
 honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not
 do't i hold it the more knavery to conceal it
 and therein am i constant to my profession
 reenter clown and shepherd
 aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain
 every lane's end every shop church session
 hanging yields a careful man work
clown see see what a man you are now
 there is no other way but to tell the king
 she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood
shepherd nay but hear me
clown nay but hear me
shepherd go to then
clown she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh
 and blood has not offended the king and so your
 flesh and blood is not to be punished by him show
 those things you found about her those secret
 things all but what she has with her this being
 done let the law go whistle i warrant you
shepherd i will tell the king all every word yea and his
 son's pranks too who i may say is no honest man
 neither to his father nor to me to go about to make
 me the king's brotherinlaw
clown indeed brotherinlaw was the farthest off you
 could have been to him and then your blood had been
 the dearer by i know how much an ounce
autolycus aside very wisely puppies
shepherd well let us to the king there is that in this
 fardel will make him scratch his beard
autolycus aside i know not what impediment this complaint
 may be to the flight of my master
clown pray heartily he be at palace
autolycus aside though i am not naturally honest i am so
 sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement
 takes off his false beard
 how now rustics whither are you bound
shepherd to the palace an it like your worship
autolycus your affairs there what with whom the condition
 of that fardel the place of your dwelling your
 names your ages of what having breeding and any
 thing that is fitting to be known discover
clown we are but plain fellows sir
autolycus a lie you are rough and hairy let me have no
 lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they
 often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for
 it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore
 they do not give us the lie
clown your worship had like to have given us one if you
 had not taken yourself with the manner
shepherd are you a courtier an't like you sir
autolycus whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest
 thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings
 hath not my gait in it the measure of the court
 receives not thy nose courtodor from me reflect i
 not on thy baseness courtcontempt thinkest thou
 for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy
 business i am therefore no courtier i am courtier
 capape and one that will either push on or pluck
 back thy business there whereupon i command thee to
 open thy affair
shepherd my business sir is to the king
autolycus what advocate hast thou to him
shepherd i know not an't like you
clown advocate's the courtword for a pheasant say you
 have none
shepherd none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen
autolycus how blessed are we that are not simple men
 yet nature might have made me as these are
 therefore i will not disdain
clown this cannot be but a great courtier
shepherd his garments are rich but he wears
 them not handsomely
clown he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical
 a great man i'll warrant i know by the picking
 on's teeth
autolycus the fardel there what's i the fardel
 wherefore that box
shepherd sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box
 which none must know but the king and which he
 shall know within this hour if i may come to the
 speech of him
autolycus age thou hast lost thy labour
shepherd why sir
autolycus the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a
 new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for
 if thou beest capable of things serious thou must
 know the king is full of grief
shepard so tis said sir about his son that should have
 married a shepherd's daughter
autolycus if that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly
 the curses he shall have the tortures he shall
 feel will break the back of man the heart of monster
clown think you so sir
autolycus not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
 and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to
 him though removed fifty times shall all come
 under the hangman which though it be great pity
 yet it is necessary an old sheepwhistling rogue a
 ramtender to offer to have his daughter come into
 grace some say he shall be stoned but that death
 is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a
 sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy
clown has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear an't
 like you sir
autolycus he has a son who shall be flayed alive then
 nointed over with honey set on the head of a
 wasp's nest then stand till he be three quarters
 and a dram dead then recovered again with
 aquavitae or some other hot infusion then raw as
 he is and in the hottest day prognostication
 proclaims shall be be set against a brickwall the
 sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he
 is to behold him with flies blown to death but what
 talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries
 are to be smiled at their offences being so
 capital tell me for you seem to be honest plain
 men what you have to the king being something
 gently considered i'll bring you where he is
 aboard tender your persons to his presence
 whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man
 besides the king to effect your suits here is man
 shall do it
clown he seems to be of great authority close with him
 give him gold and though authority be a stubborn
 bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show
 the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand
 and no more ado remember stoned and flayed alive'
shepherd an't please you sir to undertake the business for
 us here is that gold i have i'll make it as much
 more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you
autolycus after i have done what i promised
shepherd ay sir
autolycus well give me the moiety are you a party in this business
clown in some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful
 one i hope i shall not be flayed out of it
autolycus o that's the case of the shepherd's son hang him
 he'll be made an example
clown comfort good comfort we must to the king and show
 our strange sights he must know tis none of your
 daughter nor my sister we are gone else sir i
 will give you as much as this old man does when the
 business is performed and remain as he says your
 pawn till it be brought you
autolycus i will trust you walk before toward the seaside
 go on the right hand i will but look upon the
 hedge and follow you
clown we are blest in this man as i may say even blest
shepherd let's before as he bids us he was provided to do us good
 exeunt shepherd and clown
autolycus if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would
 not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth i am
 courted now with a double occasion gold and a means
 to do the prince my master good which who knows how
 that may turn back to my advancement i will bring
 these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he
 think it fit to shore them again and that the
 complaint they have to the king concerns him
 nothing let him call me rogue for being so far
 officious for i am proof against that title and
 what shame else belongs to't to him will i present
 them there may be matter in it
 exit
 the winter's tale
act v
scene i a room in leontes palace
 enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and servants
cleomenes sir you have done enough and have perform'd
 a saintlike sorrow no fault could you make
 which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down
 more penitence than done trespass at the last
 do as the heavens have done forget your evil
 with them forgive yourself
leontes whilst i remember
 her and her virtues i cannot forget
 my blemishes in them and so still think of
 the wrong i did myself which was so much
 that heirless it hath made my kingdom and
 destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
 bred his hopes out of
paulina true too true my lord
 if one by one you wedded all the world
 or from the all that are took something good
 to make a perfect woman she you kill'd
 would be unparallel'd
leontes i think so kill'd
 she i kill'd i did so but thou strikest me
 sorely to say i did it is as bitter
 upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now
 say so but seldom
cleomenes not at all good lady
 you might have spoken a thousand things that would
 have done the time more benefit and graced
 your kindness better
paulina you are one of those
 would have him wed again
dion if you would not so
 you pity not the state nor the remembrance
 of his most sovereign name consider little
 what dangers by his highness fail of issue
 may drop upon his kingdom and devour
 incertain lookers on what were more holy
 than to rejoice the former queen is well
 what holier than for royalty's repair
 for present comfort and for future good
 to bless the bed of majesty again
 with a sweet fellow to't
paulina there is none worthy
 respecting her that's gone besides the gods
 will have fulfill'd their secret purposes
 for has not the divine apollo said
 is't not the tenor of his oracle
 that king leontes shall not have an heir
 till his lost child be found which that it shall
 is all as monstrous to our human reason
 as my antigonus to break his grave
 and come again to me who on my life
 did perish with the infant tis your counsel
 my lord should to the heavens be contrary
 oppose against their wills
 to leontes
 care not for issue
 the crown will find an heir great alexander
 left his to the worthiest so his successor
 was like to be the best
leontes good paulina
 who hast the memory of hermione
 i know in honour o that ever i
 had squared me to thy counsel then even now
 i might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes
 have taken treasure from her lips
paulina and left them
 more rich for what they yielded
leontes thou speak'st truth
 no more such wives therefore no wife one worse
 and better used would make her sainted spirit
 again possess her corpse and on this stage
 where we're offenders now appear soulvex'd
 and begin why to me'
paulina had she such power
 she had just cause
leontes she had and would incense me
 to murder her i married
paulina i should so
 were i the ghost that walk'd i'ld bid you mark
 her eye and tell me for what dull part in't
 you chose her then i'ld shriek that even your ears
 should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd
 should be remember mine'
leontes stars stars
 and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife
 i'll have no wife paulina
paulina will you swear
 never to marry but by my free leave
leontes never paulina so be blest my spirit
paulina then good my lords bear witness to his oath
cleomenes you tempt him overmuch
paulina unless another
 as like hermione as is her picture
 affront his eye
cleomenes good madam
paulina i have done
 yet if my lord will marryif you will sir
 no remedy but you willgive me the office
 to choose you a queen she shall not be so young
 as was your former but she shall be such
 as walk'd your first queen's ghost
 it should take joy
 to see her in your arms
leontes my true paulina
 we shall not marry till thou bid'st us
paulina that
 shall be when your first queen's again in breath
 never till then
 enter a gentleman
gentleman one that gives out himself prince florizel
 son of polixenes with his princess she
 the fairest i have yet beheld desires access
 to your high presence
leontes what with him he comes not
 like to his father's greatness his approach
 so out of circumstance and sudden tells us
 tis not a visitation framed but forced
 by need and accident what train
gentleman but few
 and those but mean
leontes his princess say you with him
gentleman ay the most peerless piece of earth i think
 that e'er the sun shone bright on
paulina o hermione
 as every present time doth boast itself
 above a better gone so must thy grave
 give way to what's seen now sir you yourself
 have said and writ so but your writing now
 is colder than that theme she had not been
 nor was not to be equall'd'thus your verse
 flow'd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebb'd
 to say you have seen a better
gentleman pardon madam
 the one i have almost forgotyour pardon
 the other when she has obtain'd your eye
 will have your tongue too this is a creature
 would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
 of all professors else make proselytes
 of who she but bid follow
paulina how not women
gentleman women will love her that she is a woman
 more worth than any man men that she is
 the rarest of all women
leontes go cleomenes
 yourself assisted with your honour'd friends
 bring them to our embracement still tis strange
 exeunt cleomenes and others
 he thus should steal upon us
paulina had our prince
 jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd
 well with this lord there was not full a month
 between their births
leontes prithee no more cease thou know'st
 he dies to me again when talk'd of sure
 when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches
 will bring me to consider that which may
 unfurnish me of reason they are come
 reenter cleomenes and others with florizel and perdita
 your mother was most true to wedlock prince
 for she did print your royal father off
 conceiving you were i but twentyone
 your father's image is so hit in you
 his very air that i should call you brother
 as i did him and speak of something wildly
 by us perform'd before most dearly welcome
 and your fair princessgoddesso alas
 i lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth
 might thus have stood begetting wonder as
 you gracious couple do and then i lost
 all mine own follythe society
 amity too of your brave father whom
 though bearing misery i desire my life
 once more to look on him
florizel by his command
 have i here touch'd sicilia and from him
 give you all greetings that a king at friend
 can send his brother and but infirmity
 which waits upon worn times hath something seized
 his wish'd ability he had himself
 the lands and waters twixt your throne and his
 measured to look upon you whom he loves
 he bade me say somore than all the sceptres
 and those that bear them living
leontes o my brother
 good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir
 afresh within me and these thy offices
 so rarely kind are as interpreters
 of my behindhand slackness welcome hither
 as is the spring to the earth and hath he too
 exposed this paragon to the fearful usage
 at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune
 to greet a man not worth her pains much less
 the adventure of her person
florizel good my lord
 she came from libya
leontes where the warlike smalus
 that noble honour'd lord is fear'd and loved
florizel most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
 his tears proclaim'd his parting with her thence
 a prosperous southwind friendly we have cross'd
 to execute the charge my father gave me
 for visiting your highness my best train
 i have from your sicilian shores dismiss'd
 who for bohemia bend to signify
 not only my success in libya sir
 but my arrival and my wife's in safety
 here where we are
leontes the blessed gods
 purge all infection from our air whilst you
 do climate here you have a holy father
 a graceful gentleman against whose person
 so sacred as it is i have done sin
 for which the heavens taking angry note
 have left me issueless and your father's blest
 as he from heaven merits it with you
 worthy his goodness what might i have been
 might i a son and daughter now have look'd on
 such goodly things as you
 enter a lord
lord most noble sir
 that which i shall report will bear no credit
 were not the proof so nigh please you great sir
 bohemia greets you from himself by me
 desires you to attach his son who has
 his dignity and duty both cast off
 fled from his father from his hopes and with
 a shepherd's daughter
leontes where's bohemia speak
lord here in your city i now came from him
 i speak amazedly and it becomes
 my marvel and my message to your court
 whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems
 of this fair couple meets he on the way
 the father of this seeming lady and
 her brother having both their country quitted
 with this young prince
florizel camillo has betray'd me
 whose honour and whose honesty till now
 endured all weathers
lord lay't so to his charge
 he's with the king your father
leontes who camillo
lord camillo sir i spake with him who now
 has these poor men in question never saw i
 wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth
 forswear themselves as often as they speak
 bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
 with divers deaths in death
perdita o my poor father
 the heaven sets spies upon us will not have
 our contract celebrated
leontes you are married
florizel we are not sir nor are we like to be
 the stars i see will kiss the valleys first
 the odds for high and low's alike
leontes my lord
 is this the daughter of a king
florizel she is
 when once she is my wife
leontes that once i see by your good father's speed
 will come on very slowly i am sorry
 most sorry you have broken from his liking
 where you were tied in duty and as sorry
 your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
 that you might well enjoy her
florizel dear look up
 though fortune visible an enemy
 should chase us with my father power no jot
 hath she to change our loves beseech you sir
 remember since you owed no more to time
 than i do now with thought of such affections
 step forth mine advocate at your request
 my father will grant precious things as trifles
leontes would he do so i'ld beg your precious mistress
 which he counts but a trifle
paulina sir my liege
 your eye hath too much youth in't not a month
 fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
 than what you look on now
leontes i thought of her
 even in these looks i made
 to florizel
 but your petition
 is yet unanswer'd i will to your father
 your honour not o'erthrown by your desires
 i am friend to them and you upon which errand
 i now go toward him therefore follow me
 and mark what way i make come good my lord

 the winter's tale
act v
scene ii before leontes palace
 enter autolycus and a gentleman
autolycus beseech you sir were you present at this relation
first gentleman i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old
 shepherd deliver the manner how he found it
 whereupon after a little amazedness we were all
 commanded out of the chamber only this methought i
 heard the shepherd say he found the child
autolycus i would most gladly know the issue of it
first gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business but the
 changes i perceived in the king and camillo were
 very notes of admiration they seemed almost with
 staring on one another to tear the cases of their
 eyes there was speech in their dumbness language
 in their very gesture they looked as they had heard
 of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable
 passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest
 beholder that knew no more but seeing could not
 say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the
 extremity of the one it must needs be
 enter another gentleman
 here comes a gentleman that haply knows more
 the news rogero
second gentleman nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the
 king's daughter is found such a deal of wonder is
 broken out within this hour that balladmakers
 cannot be able to express it
 enter a third gentleman
 here comes the lady paulina's steward he can
 deliver you more how goes it now sir this news
 which is called true is so like an old tale that
 the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king
 found his heir
third gentleman most true if ever truth were pregnant by
 circumstance that which you hear you'll swear you
 see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle
 of queen hermione's her jewel about the neck of it
 the letters of antigonus found with it which they
 know to be his character the majesty of the
 creature in resemblance of the mother the affection
 of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding
 and many other evidences proclaim her with all
 certainty to be the king's daughter did you see
 the meeting of the two kings
second gentleman no
third gentleman then have you lost a sight which was to be seen
 cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one
 joy crown another so and in such manner that it
 seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their
 joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes
 holding up of hands with countenances of such
 distraction that they were to be known by garment
 not by favour our king being ready to leap out of
 himself for joy of his found daughter as if that
 joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother
 thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then
 embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his
 daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old
 shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten
 conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such
 another encounter which lames report to follow it
 and undoes description to do it
second gentleman what pray you became of antigonus that carried
 hence the child
third gentleman like an old tale still which will have matter to
 rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear
 open he was torn to pieces with a bear this
 avouches the shepherd's son who has not only his
 innocence which seems much to justify him but a
 handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows
first gentleman what became of his bark and his followers
third gentleman wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
 in the view of the shepherd so that all the
 instruments which aided to expose the child were
 even then lost when it was found but o the noble
 combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
 paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of
 her husband another elevated that the oracle was
 fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth
 and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin
 her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
 of losing
first gentleman the dignity of this act was worth the audience of
 kings and princes for by such was it acted
third gentleman one of the prettiest touches of all and that which
 angled for mine eyes caught the water though not
 the fish was when at the relation of the queen's
 death with the manner how she came to't bravely
 confessed and lamented by the king how
 attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one
 sign of dolour to another she did with an alas'
 i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my
 heart wept blood who was most marble there changed
 colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world
 could have seen t the woe had been universal
first gentleman are they returned to the court
third gentleman no the princess hearing of her mother's statue
 which is in the keeping of paulinaa piece many
 years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
 italian master julio romano who had he himself
 eternity and could put breath into his work would
 beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her
 ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that
 they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
 answer thither with all greediness of affection
 are they gone and there they intend to sup
second gentleman i thought she had some great matter there in hand
 for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever
 since the death of hermione visited that removed
 house shall we thither and with our company piece
 the rejoicing
first gentleman who would be thence that has the benefit of access
 every wink of an eye some new grace will be born
 our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge
 let's along
 exeunt gentlemen
autolycus now had i not the dash of my former life in me
 would preferment drop on my head i brought the old
 man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard
 them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he
 at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter
 so he then took her to be who began to be much
 seasick and himself little better extremity of
 weather continuing this mystery remained
 undiscovered but tis all one to me for had i
 been the finder out of this secret it would not
 have relished among my other discredits
 enter shepherd and clown
 here come those i have done good to against my will
 and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
shepherd come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and
 daughters will be all gentlemen born
clown you are well met sir you denied to fight with me
 this other day because i was no gentleman born
 see you these clothes say you see them not and
 think me still no gentleman born you were best say
 these robes are not gentlemen born give me the
 lie do and try whether i am not now a gentleman born
autolycus i know you are now sir a gentleman born
clown ay and have been so any time these four hours
shepherd and so have i boy
clown so you have but i was a gentleman born before my
 father for the king's son took me by the hand and
 called me brother and then the two kings called my
 father brother and then the prince my brother and
 the princess my sister called my father father and
 so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike
 tears that ever we shed
shepherd we may live son to shed many more
clown ay or else twere hard luck being in so
 preposterous estate as we are
autolycus i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the
 faults i have committed to your worship and to give
 me your good report to the prince my master
shepherd prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are
 gentlemen
clown thou wilt amend thy life
autolycus ay an it like your good worship
clown give me thy hand i will swear to the prince thou
 art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia
shepherd you may say it but not swear it
clown not swear it now i am a gentleman let boors and
 franklins say it i'll swear it
shepherd how if it be false son
clown if it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear
 it in the behalf of his friend and i'll swear to
 the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
 that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no
 tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
 drunk but i'll swear it and i would thou wouldst
 be a tall fellow of thy hands
autolycus i will prove so sir to my power
clown ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not
 wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not
 being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings
 and the princes our kindred are going to see the
 queen's picture come follow us we'll be thy
 good masters

 the winter's tale
act v
scene iii a chapel in paulina's house
 enter leontes polixenes florizel perdita
 camillo paulina lords and attendants
leontes o grave and good paulina the great comfort
 that i have had of thee
paulina what sovereign sir
 i did not well i meant well all my services
 you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed
 with your crown'd brother and these your contracted
 heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
 it is a surplus of your grace which never
 my life may last to answer
leontes o paulina
 we honour you with trouble but we came
 to see the statue of our queen your gallery
 have we pass'd through not without much content
 in many singularities but we saw not
 that which my daughter came to look upon
 the statue of her mother
paulina as she lived peerless
 so her dead likeness i do well believe
 excels whatever yet you look'd upon
 or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it
 lonely apart but here it is prepare
 to see the life as lively mock'd as ever
 still sleep mock'd death behold and say tis well
 paulina draws a curtain and discovers hermione
 standing like a statue
 i like your silence it the more shows off
 your wonder but yet speak first you my liege
 comes it not something near
leontes her natural posture
 chide me dear stone that i may say indeed
 thou art hermione or rather thou art she
 in thy not chiding for she was as tender
 as infancy and grace but yet paulina
 hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
 so aged as this seems
polixenes o not by much
paulina so much the more our carver's excellence
 which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
 as she lived now
leontes as now she might have done
 so much to my good comfort as it is
 now piercing to my soul o thus she stood
 even with such life of majesty warm life
 as now it coldly stands when first i woo'd her
 i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me
 for being more stone than it o royal piece
 there's magic in thy majesty which has
 my evils conjured to remembrance and
 from thy admiring daughter took the spirits
 standing like stone with thee
perdita and give me leave
 and do not say tis superstition that
 i kneel and then implore her blessing lady
 dear queen that ended when i but began
 give me that hand of yours to kiss
paulina o patience
 the statue is but newly fix'd the colour's not dry
camillo my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
 which sixteen winters cannot blow away
 so many summers dry scarce any joy
 did ever so long live no sorrow
 but kill'd itself much sooner
polixenes dear my brother
 let him that was the cause of this have power
 to take off so much grief from you as he
 will piece up in himself
paulina indeed my lord
 if i had thought the sight of my poor image
 would thus have wrought youfor the stone is mine
 i'ld not have show'd it
leontes do not draw the curtain
paulina no longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy
 may think anon it moves
leontes let be let be
 would i were dead but that methinks already
 what was he that did make it see my lord
 would you not deem it breathed and that those veins
 did verily bear blood
polixenes masterly done
 the very life seems warm upon her lip
leontes the fixture of her eye has motion in't
 as we are mock'd with art
paulina i'll draw the curtain
 my lord's almost so far transported that
 he'll think anon it lives
leontes o sweet paulina
 make me to think so twenty years together
 no settled senses of the world can match
 the pleasure of that madness let t alone
paulina i am sorry sir i have thus far stirr'd you but
 i could afflict you farther
leontes do paulina
 for this affliction has a taste as sweet
 as any cordial comfort still methinks
 there is an air comes from her what fine chisel
 could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me
 for i will kiss her
paulina good my lord forbear
 the ruddiness upon her lip is wet
 you'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
 with oily painting shall i draw the curtain
leontes no not these twenty years
perdita so long could i
 stand by a looker on
paulina either forbear
 quit presently the chapel or resolve you
 for more amazement if you can behold it
 i'll make the statue move indeed descend
 and take you by the hand but then you'll think
 which i protest againsti am assisted
 by wicked powers
leontes what you can make her do
 i am content to look on what to speak
 i am content to hear for tis as easy
 to make her speak as move
paulina it is required
 you do awake your faith then all stand still
 on those that think it is unlawful business
 i am about let them depart
leontes proceed
 no foot shall stir
paulina music awake her strike
 music
 tis time descend be stone no more approach
 strike all that look upon with marvel come
 i'll fill your grave up stir nay come away
 bequeath to death your numbness for from him
 dear life redeems you you perceive she stirs
 hermione comes down
 start not her actions shall be holy as
 you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her
 until you see her die again for then
 you kill her double nay present your hand
 when she was young you woo'd her now in age
 is she become the suitor
leontes o she's warm
 if this be magic let it be an art
 lawful as eating
polixenes she embraces him
camillo she hangs about his neck
 if she pertain to life let her speak too
polixenes ay and make't manifest where she has lived
 or how stolen from the dead
paulina that she is living
 were it but told you should be hooted at
 like an old tale but it appears she lives
 though yet she speak not mark a little while
 please you to interpose fair madam kneel
 and pray your mother's blessing turn good lady
 our perdita is found
hermione you gods look down
 and from your sacred vials pour your graces
 upon my daughter's head tell me mine own
 where hast thou been preserved where lived how found
 thy father's court for thou shalt hear that i
 knowing by paulina that the oracle
 gave hope thou wast in being have preserved
 myself to see the issue
paulina there's time enough for that
 lest they desire upon this push to trouble
 your joys with like relation go together
 you precious winners all your exultation
 partake to every one i an old turtle
 will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
 my mate that's never to be found again
 lament till i am lost
leontes o peace paulina
 thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
 as i by thine a wife this is a match
 and made between's by vows thou hast found mine
 but how is to be question'd for i saw her
 as i thought dead and have in vain said many
 a prayer upon her grave i'll not seek far
 for him i partly know his mindto find thee
 an honourable husband come camillo
 and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
 is richly noted and here justified
 by us a pair of kings let's from this place
 what look upon my brother both your pardons
 that e'er i put between your holy looks
 my ill suspicion this is your soninlaw
 and son unto the king who heavens directing
 is trothplight to your daughter good paulina
 lead us from hence where we may leisurely
 each one demand an answer to his part
 perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
 we were dissever'd hastily lead away

 enter king henry lord john of lancaster the earl
 of westmoreland sir walter blunt and others
king henry iv so shaken as we are so wan with care
 find we a time for frighted peace to pant
 and breathe shortwinded accents of new broils
 to be commenced in strands afar remote
 no more the thirsty entrance of this soil
 shall daub her lips with her own children's blood
 nor more shall trenching war channel her fields
 nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
 of hostile paces those opposed eyes
 which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
 all of one nature of one substance bred
 did lately meet in the intestine shock
 and furious close of civil butchery
 shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks
 march all one way and be no more opposed
 against acquaintance kindred and allies
 the edge of war like an illsheathed knife
 no more shall cut his master therefore friends
 as far as to the sepulchre of christ
 whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
 we are impressed and engaged to fight
 forthwith a power of english shall we levy
 whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb
 to chase these pagans in those holy fields
 over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
 which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
 for our advantage on the bitter cross
 but this our purpose now is twelve month old
 and bootless tis to tell you we will go
 therefore we meet not now then let me hear
 of you my gentle cousin westmoreland
 what yesternight our council did decree
 in forwarding this dear expedience
westmoreland my liege this haste was hot in question
 and many limits of the charge set down
 but yesternight when all athwart there came
 a post from wales loaden with heavy news
 whose worst was that the noble mortimer
 leading the men of herefordshire to fight
 against the irregular and wild glendower
 was by the rude hands of that welshman taken
 a thousand of his people butchered
 upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
 such beastly shameless transformation
 by those welshwomen done as may not be
 without much shame retold or spoken of
king henry iv it seems then that the tidings of this broil
 brake off our business for the holy land
westmoreland this match'd with other did my gracious lord
 for more uneven and unwelcome news
 came from the north and thus it did import
 on holyrood day the gallant hotspur there
 young harry percy and brave archibald
 that evervaliant and approved scot
 at holmedon met
 where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
 as by discharge of their artillery
 and shape of likelihood the news was told
 for he that brought them in the very heat
 and pride of their contention did take horse
 uncertain of the issue any way
king henry iv here is a dear a true industrious friend
 sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse
 stain'd with the variation of each soil
 betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours
 and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
 the earl of douglas is discomfited
 ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights
 balk'd in their own blood did sir walter see
 on holmedon's plains of prisoners hotspur took
 mordake the earl of fife and eldest son
 to beaten douglas and the earl of athol
 of murray angus and menteith
 and is not this an honourable spoil
 a gallant prize ha cousin is it not
westmoreland in faith
 it is a conquest for a prince to boast of
king henry iv yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
 in envy that my lord northumberland
 should be the father to so blest a son
 a son who is the theme of honour's tongue
 amongst a grove the very straightest plant
 who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride
 whilst i by looking on the praise of him
 see riot and dishonour stain the brow
 of my young harry o that it could be proved
 that some nighttripping fairy had exchanged
 in cradleclothes our children where they lay
 and call'd mine percy his plantagenet
 then would i have his harry and he mine
 but let him from my thoughts what think you coz
 of this young percy's pride the prisoners
 which he in this adventure hath surprised
 to his own use he keeps and sends me word
 i shall have none but mordake earl of fife
westmoreland this is his uncle's teaching this is worcester
 malevolent to you in all aspects
 which makes him prune himself and bristle up
 the crest of youth against your dignity
king henry iv but i have sent for him to answer this
 and for this cause awhile we must neglect
 our holy purpose to jerusalem
 cousin on wednesday next our council we
 will hold at windsor so inform the lords
 but come yourself with speed to us again
 for more is to be said and to be done
 than out of anger can be uttered

prince henry thou art so fatwitted with drinking of old sack

 benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to
 demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know
 what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
 day unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
 capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
 signs of leapinghouses and the blessed sun himself
 a fair hot wench in flamecoloured taffeta i see no
 reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
 the time of the day
falstaff indeed you come near me now hal for we that take
 purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not
 by phoebus he'that wandering knight so fair and

 save thy gracemajesty i should say for grace
 thou wilt have none

 thieves of the day's beauty let us be diana's

poins sir john i prithee leave the prince and me alone
 i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
 that he shall go
falstaff well god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
 the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may
 move and what he hears may be believed that the
 true prince may for recreation sake prove a false
 thief for the poor abuses of the time want
 countenance farewell you shall find me in eastcheap
prince henry farewell thou latter spring farewell allhallown summer
 exit falstaff
poins now my good sweet honey lord ride with us
 tomorrow i have a jest to execute that i cannot
 manage alone falstaff bardolph peto and gadshill
 shall rob those men that we have already waylaid
 yourself and i will not be there and when they
 have the booty if you and i do not rob them cut
 this head off from my shoulders
prince henry how shall we part with them in setting forth
poins why we will set forth before or after them and
 appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at
 our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure
 upon the exploit themselves which they shall have
 no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them
prince henry yea but tis like that they will know us by our
 horses by our habits and by every other
 appointment to be ourselves
poins tut our horses they shall not see i'll tie them
 in the wood our vizards we will change after we
 leave them and sirrah i have cases of buckram
 for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments
prince henry yea but i doubt they will be too hard for us
poins well for two of them i know them to be as
 truebred cowards as ever turned back and for the
 third if he fight longer than he sees reason i'll
 forswear arms the virtue of this jest will be the
 incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
 tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at
 least he fought with what wards what blows what
 extremities he endured and in the reproof of this
 lies the jest
prince henry well i'll go with thee provide us all things
 necessary and meet me tomorrow night in eastcheap
 there i'll sup farewell
poins farewell my lord
 exit poins
prince henry i know you all and will awhile uphold
 the unyoked humour of your idleness
 yet herein will i imitate the sun
 who doth permit the base contagious clouds
 to smother up his beauty from the world
 that when he please again to be himself
 being wanted he may be more wonder'd at
 by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
 of vapours that did seem to strangle him
 if all the year were playing holidays
 to sport would be as tedious as to work
 but when they seldom come they wish'd for come
 and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
 so when this loose behavior i throw off
 and pay the debt i never promised
 by how much better than my word i am
 by so much shall i falsify men's hopes
 and like bright metal on a sullen ground
 my reformation glittering o'er my fault
 shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
 than that which hath no foil to set it off
 i'll so offend to make offence a skill
 redeeming time when men think least i will

act i
scene iii london the palace
 enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur
 sir walter blunt with others
king henry iv my blood hath been too cold and temperate
 unapt to stir at these indignities
 and you have found me for accordingly
 you tread upon my patience but be sure
 i will from henceforth rather be myself
 mighty and to be fear'd than my condition
 which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
 and therefore lost that title of respect
 which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud
earl of worcester our house my sovereign liege little deserves
 the scourge of greatness to be used on it
 and that same greatness too which our own hands
 have holp to make so portly
northumberland my lord
king henry iv worcester get thee gone for i do see
 danger and disobedience in thine eye
 o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
 and majesty might never yet endure
 the moody frontier of a servant brow
 you have good leave to leave us when we need
 your use and counsel we shall send for you
 exit worcester
 you were about to speak
 to north
northumberland yea my good lord
 those prisoners in your highness name demanded
 which harry percy here at holmedon took
 were as he says not with such strength denied
 as is deliver'd to your majesty
 either envy therefore or misprison
 is guilty of this fault and not my son
hotspur my liege i did deny no prisoners
 but i remember when the fight was done
 when i was dry with rage and extreme toil
 breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
 came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd
 fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd
 show'd like a stubbleland at harvesthome
 he was perfumed like a milliner
 and twixt his finger and his thumb he held
 a pouncetbox which ever and anon
 he gave his nose and took't away again
 who therewith angry when it next came there
 took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk'd
 and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
 he call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly
 to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
 betwixt the wind and his nobility
 with many holiday and lady terms
 he question'd me amongst the rest demanded
 my prisoners in your majesty's behalf
 i then all smarting with my wounds being cold
 to be so pester'd with a popinjay
 out of my grief and my impatience
 answer'd neglectingly i know not what
 he should or he should not for he made me mad
 to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
 and talk so like a waitinggentlewoman
 of guns and drums and woundsgod save the mark
 and telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
 was parmaceti for an inward bruise
 and that it was great pity so it was
 this villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
 out of the bowels of the harmless earth
 which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
 so cowardly and but for these vile guns
 he would himself have been a soldier
 this bald unjointed chat of his my lord
 i answer'd indirectly as i said
 and i beseech you let not his report
 come current for an accusation
 betwixt my love and your high majesty
sir walter blunt the circumstance consider'd good my lord
 whate'er lord harry percy then had said
 to such a person and in such a place
 at such a time with all the rest retold
 may reasonably die and never rise
 to do him wrong or any way impeach
 what then he said so he unsay it now
king henry iv why yet he doth deny his prisoners
 but with proviso and exception
 that we at our own charge shall ransom straight
 his brotherinlaw the foolish mortimer
 who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd
 the lives of those that he did lead to fight
 against that great magician damn'd glendower
 whose daughter as we hear the earl of march
 hath lately married shall our coffers then
 be emptied to redeem a traitor home
 shall we but treason and indent with fears
 when they have lost and forfeited themselves
 no on the barren mountains let him starve
 for i shall never hold that man my friend
 whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
 to ransom home revolted mortimer
hotspur revolted mortimer
 he never did fall off my sovereign liege
 but by the chance of war to prove that true
 needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
 those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
 when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank
 in single opposition hand to hand
 he did confound the best part of an hour
 in changing hardiment with great glendower
 three times they breathed and three times did
 they drink
 upon agreement of swift severn's flood
 who then affrighted with their bloody looks
 ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
 and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
 bloodstained with these valiant combatants
 never did base and rotten policy
 colour her working with such deadly wounds
 nor could the noble mortimer
 receive so many and all willingly
 then let not him be slander'd with revolt
king henry iv thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him
 he never did encounter with glendower
 i tell thee
 he durst as well have met the devil alone
 as owen glendower for an enemy
 art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth
 let me not hear you speak of mortimer
 send me your prisoners with the speediest means
 or you shall hear in such a kind from me
 as will displease you my lord northumberland
 we licence your departure with your son
 send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
 exeunt king henry blunt and train
hotspur an if the devil come and roar for them
 i will not send them i will after straight
 and tell him so for i will ease my heart
 albeit i make a hazard of my head
northumberland what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
 here comes your uncle
 reenter worcester
hotspur speak of mortimer
 zounds i will speak of him and let my soul
 want mercy if i do not join with him
 yea on his part i'll empty all these veins
 and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
 but i will lift the downtrod mortimer
 as high in the air as this unthankful king
 as this ingrate and canker'd bolingbroke
northumberland brother the king hath made your nephew mad
earl of worcester who struck this heat up after i was gone
hotspur he will forsooth have all my prisoners
 and when i urged the ransom once again
 of my wife's brother then his cheek look'd pale
 and on my face he turn'd an eye of death
 trembling even at the name of mortimer
earl of worcester i cannot blame him was not he proclaim'd
 by richard that dead is the next of blood
northumberland he was i heard the proclamation
 and then it was when the unhappy king
 whose wrongs in us god pardondid set forth
 upon his irish expedition
 from whence he intercepted did return
 to be deposed and shortly murdered
earl of worcester and for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
 live scandalized and foully spoken of
hotspur but soft i pray you did king richard then
 proclaim my brother edmund mortimer
 heir to the crown
northumberland he did myself did hear it
hotspur nay then i cannot blame his cousin king
 that wished him on the barren mountains starve
 but shall it be that you that set the crown
 upon the head of this forgetful man
 and for his sake wear the detested blot
 of murderous subornation shall it be
 that you a world of curses undergo
 being the agents or base second means
 the cords the ladder or the hangman rather
 o pardon me that i descend so low
 to show the line and the predicament
 wherein you range under this subtle king
 shall it for shame be spoken in these days
 or fill up chronicles in time to come
 that men of your nobility and power
 did gage them both in an unjust behalf
 as both of yougod pardon ithave done
 to put down richard that sweet lovely rose
 an plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke
 and shall it in more shame be further spoken
 that you are fool'd discarded and shook off
 by him for whom these shames ye underwent
 no yet time serves wherein you may redeem
 your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
 into the good thoughts of the world again
 revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
 of this proud king who studies day and night
 to answer all the debt he owes to you
 even with the bloody payment of your deaths
 therefore i say
earl of worcester peace cousin say no more
 and now i will unclasp a secret book
 and to your quickconceiving discontents
 i'll read you matter deep and dangerous
 as full of peril and adventurous spirit
 as to o'erwalk a current roaring loud
 on the unsteadfast footing of a spear
hotspur if he fall in good night or sink or swim
 send danger from the east unto the west
 so honour cross it from the north to south
 and let them grapple o the blood more stirs
 to rouse a lion than to start a hare
northumberland imagination of some great exploit
 drives him beyond the bounds of patience
hotspur by heaven methinks it were an easy leap
 to pluck bright honour from the palefaced moon
 or dive into the bottom of the deep
 where fathomline could never touch the ground
 and pluck up drowned honour by the locks
 so he that doth redeem her thence might wear
 without corrival all her dignities
 but out upon this halffaced fellowship
earl of worcester he apprehends a world of figures here
 but not the form of what he should attend
 good cousin give me audience for a while
hotspur i cry you mercy
earl of worcester those same noble scots
 that are your prisoners
hotspur i'll keep them all
 by god he shall not have a scot of them
 no if a scot would save his soul he shall not
 i'll keep them by this hand
earl of worcester you start away
 and lend no ear unto my purposes
 those prisoners you shall keep
hotspur nay i will that's flat
 he said he would not ransom mortimer
 forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer
 but i will find him when he lies asleep
 and in his ear i'll holla mortimer'
 nay
 i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
 nothing but mortimer and give it him
 to keep his anger still in motion
earl of worcester hear you cousin a word
hotspur all studies here i solemnly defy
 save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke
 and that same swordandbuckler prince of wales
 but that i think his father loves him not
 and would be glad he met with some mischance
 i would have him poison'd with a pot of ale
earl of worcester farewell kinsman i'll talk to you
 when you are better temper'd to attend
northumberland why what a waspstung and impatient fool
 art thou to break into this woman's mood
 tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
hotspur why look you i am whipp'd and scourged with rods
 nettled and stung with pismires when i hear
 of this vile politician bolingbroke
 in richard's timewhat do you call the place
 a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire
 twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
 his uncle york where i first bow'd my knee
 unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke
 sblood
 when you and he came back from ravenspurgh
northumberland at berkley castle
hotspur you say true
 why what a candy deal of courtesy
 this fawning greyhound then did proffer me
 look'when his infant fortune came to age'
 and gentle harry percy and kind cousin'
 o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me
 good uncle tell your tale i have done
earl of worcester nay if you have not to it again
 we will stay your leisure
hotspur i have done i faith
earl of worcester then once more to your scottish prisoners
 deliver them up without their ransom straight
 and make the douglas son your only mean
 for powers in scotland which for divers reasons
 which i shall send you written be assured
 will easily be granted you my lord
 to northumberland
 your son in scotland being thus employ'd
 shall secretly into the bosom creep
 of that same noble prelate well beloved
 the archbishop
hotspur of york is it not
earl of worcester true who bears hard
 his brother's death at bristol the lord scroop
 i speak not this in estimation
 as what i think might be but what i know
 is ruminated plotted and set down
 and only stays but to behold the face
 of that occasion that shall bring it on
hotspur i smell it upon my life it will do well
northumberland before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip
hotspur why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
 and then the power of scotland and of york
 to join with mortimer ha
earl of worcester and so they shall
hotspur in faith it is exceedingly well aim'd
earl of worcester and tis no little reason bids us speed
 to save our heads by raising of a head
 for bear ourselves as even as we can
 the king will always think him in our debt
 and think we think ourselves unsatisfied
 till he hath found a time to pay us home
 and see already how he doth begin
 to make us strangers to his looks of love
hotspur he does he does we'll be revenged on him
earl of worcester cousin farewell no further go in this
 than i by letters shall direct your course
 when time is ripe which will be suddenly
 i'll steal to glendower and lord mortimer
 where you and douglas and our powers at once
 as i will fashion it shall happily meet
 to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
 which now we hold at much uncertainty
northumberland farewell good brother we shall thrive i trust
hotspur uncle adieu o let the hours be short
 till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport

 and given my treasures and my rights of thee
 to thickeyed musing and cursed melancholy
 in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch'd
 and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars
 speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed
 cry courage to the field and thou hast talk'd
 of sallies and retires of trenches tents
 of palisadoes frontiers parapets
 of basilisks of cannon culverin
 of prisoners ransom and of soldiers slain
 and all the currents of a heady fight
 thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
 and thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep
 that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
 like bubbles in a latedisturbed stream
 and in thy face strange motions have appear'd
 such as we see when men restrain their breath

 players as ever i see
falstaff peace good pintpot peace good ticklebrain
 harry i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
 time but also how thou art accompanied for though
 the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster
 it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the
 sooner it wears that thou art my son i have
 partly thy mother's word partly my own opinion
 but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
 foolishhanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant
 me if then thou be son to me here lies the point
 why being son to me art thou so pointed at shall
 the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
 blackberries a question not to be asked shall
 the sun of england prove a thief and take purses a
 question to be asked there is a thing harry
 which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
 many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch
 as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth
 the company thou keepest for harry now i do not
 speak to thee in drink but in tears not in
 pleasure but in passion not in words only but in
 woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i
 have often noted in thy company but i know not his name
prince henry what manner of man an it like your majesty
falstaff a goodly portly man i faith and a corpulent of a
 cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble
 carriage and as i think his age some fifty or
 by'r lady inclining to three score and now i
 remember me his name is falstaff if that man
 should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry
 i see virtue in his looks if then the tree may be
 known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then
 peremptorily i speak it there is virtue in that
 falstaff him keep with the rest banish and tell
 me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast
 thou been this month
prince henry dost thou speak like a king do thou stand for me
 and i'll play my father
falstaff depose me if thou dost it half so gravely so
 majestically both in word and matter hang me up by
 the heels for a rabbitsucker or a poulter's hare

 old fat man a tun of man is thy companion why
 dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that
 boltinghutch of beastliness that swollen parcel
 of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed
 cloakbag of guts that roasted manningtree ox with
 the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that
 grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in
 years wherein is he good but to taste sack and
 drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a
 capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft
 wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous
 but in all things wherein worthy but in nothing
falstaff i would your grace would take me with you whom
 means your grace

 falstaff that old whitebearded satan
falstaff my lord the man i know

 god help the wicked if to be old and merry be a
 sin then many an old host that i know is damned if
 to be fat be to be hated then pharaoh's lean kine

act iii
scene i bangor the archdeacon's house
 enter hotspur worcester mortimer and glendower
mortimer these promises are fair the parties sure
 and our induction full of prosperous hope
hotspur lord mortimer and cousin glendower
 will you sit down
 and uncle worcester a plague upon it
 i have forgot the map
glendower no here it is
 sit cousin percy sit good cousin hotspur
 for by that name as oft as lancaster
 doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
 a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
hotspur and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of
glendower i cannot blame him at my nativity
 the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
 of burning cressets and at my birth
 the frame and huge foundation of the earth
 shaked like a coward
hotspur why so it would have done at the same season if
 your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself
 had never been born
glendower i say the earth did shake when i was born
hotspur and i say the earth was not of my mind
 if you suppose as fearing you it shook
glendower the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
hotspur o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
 and not in fear of your nativity
 diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
 in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
 is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
 by the imprisoning of unruly wind
 within her womb which for enlargement striving
 shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
 steeples and mossgrown towers at your birth
 our grandam earth having this distemperature
 in passion shook
glendower cousin of many men
 i do not bear these crossings give me leave
 to tell you once again that at my birth
 the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
 the goats ran from the mountains and the herds
 were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
 these signs have mark'd me extraordinary
 and all the courses of my life do show
 i am not in the roll of common men
 where is he living clipp'd in with the sea
 that chides the banks of england scotland wales
 which calls me pupil or hath read to me
 and bring him out that is but woman's son
 can trace me in the tedious ways of art
 and hold me pace in deep experiments
hotspur i think there's no man speaks better welsh
 i'll to dinner
mortimer peace cousin percy you will make him mad
glendower i can call spirits from the vasty deep
hotspur why so can i or so can any man
 but will they come when you do call for them
glendower why i can teach you cousin to command
 the devil
hotspur and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil
 by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
 if thou have power to raise him bring him hither
 and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence
 o while you live tell truth and shame the devil
mortimer come come no more of this unprofitable chat
glendower three times hath henry bolingbroke made head
 against my power thrice from the banks of wye
 and sandybottom'd severn have i sent him
 bootless home and weatherbeaten back
hotspur home without boots and in foul weather too
 how scapes he agues in the devil's name
glendower come here's the map shall we divide our right
 according to our threefold order ta'en
mortimer the archdeacon hath divided it
 into three limits very equally
 england from trent and severn hitherto
 by south and east is to my part assign'd
 all westward wales beyond the severn shore
 and all the fertile land within that bound
 to owen glendower and dear coz to you
 the remnant northward lying off from trent
 and our indentures tripartite are drawn
 which being sealed interchangeably
 a business that this night may execute
 tomorrow cousin percy you and i
 and my good lord of worcester will set forth
 to meet your father and the scottish power
 as is appointed us at shrewsbury
 my father glendower is not ready yet
 not shall we need his help these fourteen days
 within that space you may have drawn together
 your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
glendower a shorter time shall send me to you lords
 and in my conduct shall your ladies come
 from whom you now must steal and take no leave
 for there will be a world of water shed
 upon the parting of your wives and you
hotspur methinks my moiety north from burton here
 in quantity equals not one of yours
 see how this river comes me cranking in
 and cuts me from the best of all my land
 a huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out
 i'll have the current in this place damm'd up
 and here the smug and silver trent shall run
 in a new channel fair and evenly
 it shall not wind with such a deep indent
 to rob me of so rich a bottom here
glendower not wind it shall it must you see it doth
mortimer yea but
 mark how he bears his course and runs me up
 with like advantage on the other side
 gelding the opposed continent as much
 as on the other side it takes from you
earl of worcester yea but a little charge will trench him here
 and on this north side win this cape of land
 and then he runs straight and even
hotspur i'll have it so a little charge will do it
glendower i'll not have it alter'd
hotspur will not you
glendower no nor you shall not
hotspur who shall say me nay
glendower why that will i
hotspur let me not understand you then speak it in welsh
glendower i can speak english lord as well as you
 for i was train'd up in the english court
 where being but young i framed to the harp
 many an english ditty lovely well
 and gave the tongue a helpful ornament
 a virtue that was never seen in you
hotspur marry
 and i am glad of it with all my heart
 i had rather be a kitten and cry mew
 than one of these same metre balladmongers
 i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd
 or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
 and that would set my teeth nothing on edge
 nothing so much as mincing poetry
 tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag
glendower come you shall have trent turn'd
hotspur i do not care i'll give thrice so much land
 to any welldeserving friend
 but in the way of bargain mark ye me
 i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
 are the indentures drawn shall we be gone
glendower the moon shines fair you may away by night
 i'll haste the writer and withal
 break with your wives of your departure hence
 i am afraid my daughter will run mad
 so much she doteth on her mortimer
 exit glendower
mortimer fie cousin percy how you cross my father
hotspur i cannot choose sometime he angers me
 with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant
 of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies
 and of a dragon and a finless fish
 a clipwing'd griffin and a moulten raven
 a couching lion and a ramping cat
 and such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff
 as puts me from my faith i tell you what
 he held me last night at least nine hours
 in reckoning up the several devils names
 that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to'
 but mark'd him not a word o he is as tedious
 as a tired horse a railing wife
 worse than a smoky house i had rather live
 with cheese and garlic in a windmill far
 than feed on cates and have him talk to me
 in any summerhouse in christendom
mortimer in faith he is a worthy gentleman
 exceedingly well read and profited
 in strange concealments valiant as a lion
 and as wondrous affable and as bountiful
 as mines of india shall i tell you cousin
 he holds your temper in a high respect
 and curbs himself even of his natural scope
 when you come cross his humour faith he does
 i warrant you that man is not alive
 might so have tempted him as you have done
 without the taste of danger and reproof
 but do not use it oft let me entreat you
earl of worcester in faith my lord you are too wilfulblame
 and since your coming hither have done enough
 to put him quite beside his patience
 you must needs learn lord to amend this fault
 though sometimes it show greatness courage blood
 and that's the dearest grace it renders you
 yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
 defect of manners want of government
 pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
 the least of which haunting a nobleman
 loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
 upon the beauty of all parts besides
 beguiling them of commendation
hotspur well i am school'd good manners be your speed
 here come our wives and let us take our leave
 reenter glendower with the ladies
mortimer this is the deadly spite that angers me
 my wife can speak no english i no welsh
glendower my daughter weeps she will not part with you
 she'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars
mortimer good father tell her that she and my aunt percy
 shall follow in your conduct speedily
 glendower speaks to her in welsh and she
 answers him in the same
glendower she is desperate here a peevish selfwind harlotry
 one that no persuasion can do good upon
 the lady speaks in welsh
mortimer i understand thy looks that pretty welsh
 which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
 i am too perfect in and but for shame
 in such a parley should i answer thee
 the lady speaks again in welsh
 i understand thy kisses and thou mine
 and that's a feeling disputation
 but i will never be a truant love
 till i have learned thy language for thy tongue
 makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd
 sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower
 with ravishing division to her lute
glendower nay if you melt then will she run mad
 the lady speaks again in welsh
mortimer o i am ignorance itself in this
glendower she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
 and rest your gentle head upon her lap
 and she will sing the song that pleaseth you
 and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
 charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
 making such difference twixt wake and sleep
 as is the difference betwixt day and night
 the hour before the heavenlyharness'd team
 begins his golden progress in the east
mortimer with all my heart i'll sit and hear her sing
 by that time will our book i think be drawn
glendower do so
 and those musicians that shall play to you
 hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
 and straight they shall be here sit and attend
hotspur come kate thou art perfect in lying down come
 quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap
lady percy go ye giddy goose
 the music plays
hotspur now i perceive the devil understands welsh
 and tis no marvel he is so humorous
 by'r lady he is a good musician
lady percy then should you be nothing but musical for you are
 altogether governed by humours lie still ye thief
 and hear the lady sing in welsh
hotspur i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish
lady percy wouldst thou have thy head broken
hotspur no
lady percy then be still
hotspur neither'tis a woman's fault
lady percy now god help thee
hotspur to the welsh lady's bed
lady percy what's that
hotspur peace she sings
 here the lady sings a welsh song
hotspur come kate i'll have your song too
lady percy not mine in good sooth
hotspur not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a
 comfitmaker's wife not you in good sooth and
 as true as i live and as god shall mend me and
 as sure as day'
 and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
 as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury
 swear me kate like a lady as thou art
 a good mouthfilling oath and leave in sooth'
 and such protest of peppergingerbread
 to velvetguards and sundaycitizens
 come sing
lady percy i will not sing
hotspur tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast
 teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away
 within these two hours and so come in when ye will
 exit
glendower come come lord mortimer you are as slow
 as hot lord percy is on fire to go
 by this our book is drawn we'll but seal
 and then to horse immediately
mortimer with all my heart

act iii
scene ii london the palace
 enter king henry iv prince henry and others
king henry iv lords give us leave the prince of wales and i
 must have some private conference but be near at hand
 for we shall presently have need of you
 exeunt lords
 i know not whether god will have it so
 for some displeasing service i have done
 that in his secret doom out of my blood
 he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me
 but thou dost in thy passages of life
 make me believe that thou art only mark'd
 for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
 to punish my mistreadings tell me else
 could such inordinate and low desires
 such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
 such barren pleasures rude society
 as thou art match'd withal and grafted to
 accompany the greatness of thy blood
 and hold their level with thy princely heart
prince henry so please your majesty i would i could
 quit all offences with as clear excuse
 as well as i am doubtless i can purge
 myself of many i am charged withal
 yet such extenuation let me beg
 as in reproof of many tales devised
 which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
 by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
 i may for some things true wherein my youth
 hath faulty wander'd and irregular
 find pardon on my true submission
king henry iv god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry
 at thy affections which do hold a wing
 quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
 thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
 which by thy younger brother is supplied
 and art almost an alien to the hearts
 of all the court and princes of my blood
 the hope and expectation of thy time
 is ruin'd and the soul of every man
 prophetically doth forethink thy fall
 had i so lavish of my presence been
 so commonhackney'd in the eyes of men
 so stale and cheap to vulgar company
 opinion that did help me to the crown
 had still kept loyal to possession
 and left me in reputeless banishment
 a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
 by being seldom seen i could not stir
 but like a comet i was wonder'd at
 that men would tell their children this is he'
 others would say where which is bolingbroke'
 and then i stole all courtesy from heaven
 and dress'd myself in such humility
 that i did pluck allegiance from men's hearts
 loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
 even in the presence of the crowned king
 thus did i keep my person fresh and new
 my presence like a robe pontifical
 ne'er seen but wonder'd at and so my state
 seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
 and won by rareness such solemnity
 the skipping king he ambled up and down
 with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
 soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
 mingled his royalty with capering fools
 had his great name profaned with their scorns
 and gave his countenance against his name
 to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
 of every beardless vain comparative
 grew a companion to the common streets
 enfeoff'd himself to popularity
 that being daily swallow'd by men's eyes
 they surfeited with honey and began
 to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
 more than a little is by much too much
 so when he had occasion to be seen
 he was but as the cuckoo is in june
 heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
 as sick and blunted with community
 afford no extraordinary gaze
 such as is bent on sunlike majesty
 when it shines seldom in admiring eyes
 but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down
 slept in his face and render'd such aspect
 as cloudy men use to their adversaries
 being with his presence glutted gorged and full
 and in that very line harry standest thou
 for thou has lost thy princely privilege
 with vile participation not an eye
 but is aweary of thy common sight
 save mine which hath desired to see thee more
 which now doth that i would not have it do
 make blind itself with foolish tenderness
prince henry i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
 be more myself
king henry iv for all the world
 as thou art to this hour was richard then
 when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh
 and even as i was then is percy now
 now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
 he hath more worthy interest to the state
 than thou the shadow of succession
 for of no right nor colour like to right
 he doth fill fields with harness in the realm
 turns head against the lion's armed jaws
 and being no more in debt to years than thou
 leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
 to bloody battles and to bruising arms
 what neverdying honour hath he got
 against renowned douglas whose high deeds
 whose hot incursions and great name in arms
 holds from all soldiers chief majority
 and military title capital
 through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ
 thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes
 this infant warrior in his enterprises
 discomfited great douglas ta'en him once
 enlarged him and made a friend of him
 to fill the mouth of deep defiance up
 and shake the peace and safety of our throne
 and what say you to this percy northumberland
 the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer
 capitulate against us and are up
 but wherefore do i tell these news to thee
 why harry do i tell thee of my foes
 which art my near'st and dearest enemy
 thou that art like enough through vassal fear
 base inclination and the start of spleen
 to fight against me under percy's pay
 to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
 to show how much thou art degenerate
prince henry do not think so you shall not find it so
 and god forgive them that so much have sway'd
 your majesty's good thoughts away from me
 i will redeem all this on percy's head
 and in the closing of some glorious day
 be bold to tell you that i am your son
 when i will wear a garment all of blood
 and stain my favours in a bloody mask
 which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it
 and that shall be the day whene'er it lights
 that this same child of honour and renown
 this gallant hotspur this allpraised knight
 and your unthoughtof harry chance to meet
 for every honour sitting on his helm
 would they were multitudes and on my head
 my shames redoubled for the time will come
 that i shall make this northern youth exchange
 his glorious deeds for my indignities
 percy is but my factor good my lord
 to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
 and i will call him to so strict account
 that he shall render every glory up
 yea even the slightest worship of his time
 or i will tear the reckoning from his heart
 this in the name of god i promise here
 the which if he be pleased i shall perform
 i do beseech your majesty may salve
 the longgrown wounds of my intemperance
 if not the end of life cancels all bands
 and i will die a hundred thousand deaths
 ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
king henry iv a hundred thousand rebels die in this
 thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
 enter blunt

 lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word

act iv
scene i the rebel camp near shrewsbury
 enter hotspur worcester and douglas
hotspur well said my noble scot if speaking truth
 in this fine age were not thought flattery
 such attribution should the douglas have
 as not a soldier of this season's stamp
 should go so general current through the world
 by god i cannot flatter i do defy
 the tongues of soothers but a braver place
 in my heart's love hath no man than yourself
 nay task me to my word approve me lord
earl of douglas thou art the king of honour
 no man so potent breathes upon the ground
 but i will beard him
hotspur do so and tis well
 enter a messenger with letters
 what letters hast thou therei can but thank you
messenger these letters come from your father
hotspur letters from him why comes he not himself
messenger he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
hotspur zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
 in such a rustling time who leads his power
 under whose government come they along
messenger his letters bear his mind not i my lord
earl of worcester i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
messenger he did my lord four days ere i set forth
 and at the time of my departure thence
 he was much fear'd by his physicians
earl of worcester i would the state of time had first been whole
 ere he by sickness had been visited
 his health was never better worth than now
hotspur sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
 the very lifeblood of our enterprise
 tis catching hither even to our camp
 he writes me here that inward sickness
 and that his friends by deputation could not
 so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet
 to lay so dangerous and dear a trust
 on any soul removed but on his own
 yet doth he give us bold advertisement
 that with our small conjunction we should on
 to see how fortune is disposed to us
 for as he writes there is no quailing now
 because the king is certainly possess'd
 of all our purposes what say you to it
earl of worcester your father's sickness is a maim to us
hotspur a perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off
 and yet in faith it is not his present want
 seems more than we shall find it were it good
 to set the exact wealth of all our states
 all at one cast to set so rich a main
 on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
 it were not good for therein should we read
 the very bottom and the soul of hope
 the very list the very utmost bound
 of all our fortunes
earl of douglas faith and so we should
 where now remains a sweet reversion
 we may boldly spend upon the hope of what
 is to come in
 a comfort of retirement lives in this
hotspur a rendezvous a home to fly unto
 if that the devil and mischance look big
 upon the maidenhead of our affairs
earl of worcester but yet i would your father had been here
 the quality and hair of our attempt
 brooks no division it will be thought
 by some that know not why he is away
 that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
 of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
 and think how such an apprehension
 may turn the tide of fearful faction
 and breed a kind of question in our cause
 for well you know we of the offering side
 must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
 and stop all sightholes every loop from whence
 the eye of reason may pry in upon us
 this absence of your father's draws a curtain
 that shows the ignorant a kind of fear
 before not dreamt of
hotspur you strain too far
 i rather of his absence make this use
 it lends a lustre and more great opinion
 a larger dare to our great enterprise
 than if the earl were here for men must think
 if we without his help can make a head
 to push against a kingdom with his help
 we shall o'erturn it topsyturvy down
 yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
earl of douglas as heart can think there is not such a word
 spoke of in scotland as this term of fear
 enter sir richard vernon
hotspur my cousin vernon welcome by my soul
vernon pray god my news be worth a welcome lord
 the earl of westmoreland seven thousand strong
 is marching hitherwards with him prince john
hotspur no harm what more
vernon and further i have learn'd
 the king himself in person is set forth
 or hitherwards intended speedily
 with strong and mighty preparation
hotspur he shall be welcome too where is his son
 the nimblefooted madcap prince of wales
 and his comrades that daff'd the world aside
 and bid it pass
vernon all furnish'd all in arms
 all plumed like estridges that with the wind
 baited like eagles having lately bathed
 glittering in golden coats like images
 as full of spirit as the month of may

 his cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm'd

 to turn and wind a fiery pegasus

 this praise doth nourish agues let them come
 they come like sacrifices in their trim

 and yet not ours come let me taste my horse

 discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to
 younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers

 swinekeeping from eating draff and husks a mad
 fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded
 all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies no eye
 hath seen such scarecrows i'll not march through
 coventry with them that's flat nay and the
 villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had
 gyves on for indeed i had the most of them out of
 prison there's but a shirt and a half in all my
 company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
 together and thrown over the shoulders like an
 herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say

hotspur his is certain ours is doubtful
earl of worcester good cousin be advised stir not tonight

earl of douglas you do not counsel well
 you speak it out of fear and cold heart
vernon do me no slander douglas by my life
 and i dare well maintain it with my life
 if wellrespected honour bid me on
 i hold as little counsel with weak fear
 as you my lord or any scot that this day lives
 let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
 which of us fears
earl of douglas yea or tonight
vernon content
hotspur tonight say i
vernon come come it nay not be i wonder much
 being men of such great leading as you are
 that you foresee not what impediments
 drag back our expedition certain horse
 of my cousin vernon's are not yet come up
 your uncle worcester's horse came but today
 and now their pride and mettle is asleep
 their courage with hard labour tame and dull
 that not a horse is half the half of himself
hotspur so are the horses of the enemy
 in general journeybated and brought low
 the better part of ours are full of rest
earl of worcester the number of the king exceedeth ours
 for god's sake cousin stay till all come in
 the trumpet sounds a parley
 enter sir walter blunt
sir walter blunt i come with gracious offers from the king
 if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
hotspur welcome sir walter blunt and would to god
 you were of our determination
 some of us love you well and even those some
 envy your great deservings and good name
 because you are not of our quality
 but stand against us like an enemy
sir walter blunt and god defend but still i should stand so
 so long as out of limit and true rule
 you stand against anointed majesty
 but to my charge the king hath sent to know
 the nature of your griefs and whereupon
 you conjure from the breast of civil peace
 such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
 audacious cruelty if that the king
 have any way your good deserts forgot
 which he confesseth to be manifold
 he bids you name your griefs and with all speed
 you shall have your desires with interest
 and pardon absolute for yourself and these
 herein misled by your suggestion
hotspur the king is kind and well we know the king
 knows at what time to promise when to pay
 my father and my uncle and myself
 did give him that same royalty he wears
 and when he was not six and twenty strong
 sick in the world's regard wretched and low
 a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
 my father gave him welcome to the shore
 and when he heard him swear and vow to god
 he came but to be duke of lancaster
 to sue his livery and beg his peace
 with tears of innocency and terms of zeal
 my father in kind heart and pity moved
 swore him assistance and perform'd it too
 now when the lords and barons of the realm
 perceived northumberland did lean to him
 the more and less came in with cap and knee
 met him in boroughs cities villages
 attended him on bridges stood in lanes
 laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths
 gave him their heirs as pages follow'd him
 even at the heels in golden multitudes
 he presently as greatness knows itself
 steps me a little higher than his vow
 made to my father while his blood was poor
 upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh
 and now forsooth takes on him to reform
 some certain edicts and some strait decrees
 that lie too heavy on the commonwealth
 cries out upon abuses seems to weep
 over his country's wrongs and by this face
 this seeming brow of justice did he win
 the hearts of all that he did angle for
 proceeded further cut me off the heads
 of all the favourites that the absent king
 in deputation left behind him here
 when he was personal in the irish war
sir walter blunt tut i came not to hear this
hotspur then to the point
 in short time after he deposed the king
 soon after that deprived him of his life
 and in the neck of that task'd the whole state
 to make that worse suffer'd his kinsman march
 who is if every owner were well placed
 indeed his king to be engaged in wales
 there without ransom to lie forfeited
 disgraced me in my happy victories
 sought to entrap me by intelligence
 rated mine uncle from the councilboard
 in rage dismiss'd my father from the court
 broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
 and in conclusion drove us to seek out
 this head of safety and withal to pry
 into his title the which we find
 too indirect for long continuance
sir walter blunt shall i return this answer to the king
hotspur not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile
 go to the king and let there be impawn'd
 some surety for a safe return again
 and in the morning early shall my uncle
 bring him our purposes and so farewell
sir walter blunt i would you would accept of grace and love
hotspur and may be so we shall
sir walter blunt pray god you do

 to whom they are directed if you knew
 how much they do to import you would make haste
sir michael my good lord
 i guess their tenor
archbishop of york like enough you do
 tomorrow good sir michael is a day
 wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
 must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury
 as i am truly given to understand
 the king with mighty and quickraised power
 meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael
 what with the sickness of northumberland
 whose power was in the first proportion
 and what with owen glendower's absence thence
 who with them was a rated sinew too
 and comes not in o'erruled by prophecies
 i fear the power of percy is too weak
 to wage an instant trial with the king
sir michael why my good lord you need not fear
 there is douglas and lord mortimer
archbishop of york no mortimer is not there
sir michael but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy
 and there is my lord of worcester and a head
 of gallant warriors noble gentlemen
archbishop of york and so there is but yet the king hath drawn
 the special head of all the land together
 the prince of wales lord john of lancaster
 the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt
 and moe corrivals and dear men
 of estimation and command in arms
sir michael doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed
archbishop of york i hope no less yet needful tis to fear
 and to prevent the worst sir michael speed
 for if lord percy thrive not ere the king
 dismiss his power he means to visit us
 for he hath heard of our confederacy

 above yon busky hill the day looks pale
 at his distemperature
prince henry the southern wind
 doth play the trumpet to his purposes
 and by his hollow whistling in the leaves
 foretells a tempest and a blustering day
king henry iv then with the losers let it sympathize
 for nothing can seem foul to those that win
 the trumpet sounds
 enter worcester and vernon
 how now my lord of worcester tis not well
 that you and i should meet upon such terms
 as now we meet you have deceived our trust
 and made us doff our easy robes of peace
 to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
 this is not well my lord this is not well
 what say you to it will you again unknit
 this curlish knot of allabhorred war
 and move in that obedient orb again
 where you did give a fair and natural light
 and be no more an exhaled meteor
 a prodigy of fear and a portent
 of broached mischief to the unborn times
earl of worcester hear me my liege
 for mine own part i could be well content
 to entertain the lagend of my life
 with quiet hours for i do protest
 i have not sought the day of this dislike
king henry iv you have not sought it how comes it then
falstaff rebellion lay in his way and he found it
prince henry peace chewet peace
earl of worcester it pleased your majesty to turn your looks
 of favour from myself and all our house
 and yet i must remember you my lord
 we were the first and dearest of your friends
 for you my staff of office did i break
 in richard's time and posted day and night
 to meet you on the way and kiss your hand
 when yet you were in place and in account
 nothing so strong and fortunate as i
 it was myself my brother and his son
 that brought you home and boldly did outdare
 the dangers of the time you swore to us
 and you did swear that oath at doncaster
 that you did nothing purpose gainst the state
 nor claim no further than your newfall'n right
 the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster
 to this we swore our aid but in short space
 it rain'd down fortune showering on your head
 and such a flood of greatness fell on you
 what with our help what with the absent king
 what with the injuries of a wanton time
 the seeming sufferances that you had borne
 and the contrarious winds that held the king
 so long in his unlucky irish wars
 that all in england did repute him dead
 and from this swarm of fair advantages
 you took occasion to be quickly woo'd
 to gripe the general sway into your hand
 forget your oath to us at doncaster
 and being fed by us you used us so
 as that ungentle hull the cuckoo's bird
 useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
 grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
 that even our love durst not come near your sight
 for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
 we were enforced for safety sake to fly
 out of sight and raise this present head
 whereby we stand opposed by such means
 as you yourself have forged against yourself
 by unkind usage dangerous countenance
 and violation of all faith and troth
 sworn to us in your younger enterprise
king henry iv these things indeed you have articulate
 proclaim'd at marketcrosses read in churches
 to face the garment of rebellion
 with some fine colour that may please the eye
 of fickle changelings and poor discontents
 which gape and rub the elbow at the news
 of hurlyburly innovation
 and never yet did insurrection want
 such watercolours to impaint his cause
 nor moody beggars starving for a time
 of pellmell havoc and confusion
prince henry in both your armies there is many a soul
 shall pay full dearly for this encounter
 if once they join in trial tell your nephew
 the prince of wales doth join with all the world
 in praise of henry percy by my hopes
 this present enterprise set off his head
 i do not think a braver gentleman
 more activevaliant or more valiantyoung
 more daring or more bold is now alive
 to grace this latter age with noble deeds
 for my part i may speak it to my shame
 i have a truant been to chivalry
 and so i hear he doth account me too
 yet this before my father's majesty
 i am content that he shall take the odds
 of his great name and estimation
 and will to save the blood on either side
 try fortune with him in a single fight
king henry iv and prince of wales so dare we venture thee
 albeit considerations infinite
 do make against it no good worcester no
 we love our people well even those we love
 that are misled upon your cousin's part
 and will they take the offer of our grace
 both he and they and you every man
 shall be my friend again and i'll be his
 so tell your cousin and bring me word
 what he will do but if he will not yield
 rebuke and dread correction wait on us
 and they shall do their office so be gone
 we will not now be troubled with reply
 we offer fair take it advisedly
 exeunt worcester and vernon
prince henry it will not be accepted on my life
 the douglas and the hotspur both together

 the liberal and kind offer of the king
vernon twere best he did
earl of worcester then are we all undone
 it is not possible it cannot be
 the king should keep his word in loving us
 he will suspect us still and find a time
 to punish this offence in other faults
 suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
 for treason is but trusted like the fox
 who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up
 will have a wild trick of his ancestors
 look how we can or sad or merrily
 interpretation will misquote our looks
 and we shall feed like oxen at a stall
 the better cherish'd still the nearer death
 my nephew's trespass may be well forgot
 it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
 and an adopted name of privilege
 a hairbrain'd hotspur govern'd by a spleen
 all his offences live upon my head
 and on his father's we did train him on
 and his corruption being ta'en from us
 we as the spring of all shall pay for all

 which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
earl of worcester the prince of wales stepp'd forth before the king
 and nephew challenged you to single fight
hotspur o would the quarrel lay upon our heads
 and that no man might draw short breath today
 but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me
 how show'd his tasking seem'd it in contempt
vernon no by my soul i never in my life
 did hear a challenge urged more modestly
 unless a brother should a brother dare
 to gentle exercise and proof of arms
 he gave you all the duties of a man
 trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
 spoke to your deservings like a chronicle
 making you ever better than his praise
 by still dispraising praise valued in you
 and which became him like a prince indeed
 he made a blushing cital of himself
 and chid his truant youth with such a grace
 as if he master'd there a double spirit
 of teaching and of learning instantly
 there did he pause but let me tell the world
 if he outlive the envy of this day
 england did never owe so sweet a hope
 so much misconstrued in his wantonness
hotspur cousin i think thou art enamoured
 on his follies never did i hear
 of any prince so wild a libertine
 but be he as he will yet once ere night
 i will embrace him with a soldier's arm
 that he shall shrink under my courtesy

 can lift your blood up with persuasion

 i'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
 tomorrow sblood'twas time to counterfeit or
 that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot too
 counterfeit i lie i am no counterfeit to die
 is to be a counterfeit for he is but the
 counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man
 but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
 liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and
 perfect image of life indeed the better part of
 valour is discretion in the which better part i
 have saved my life'zounds i am afraid of this
 gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he
 should counterfeit too and rise by my faith i am
 afraid he would prove the better counterfeit
 therefore i'll make him sure yea and i'll swear i
 killed him why may not he rise as well as i
 nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me
 therefore sirrah
 stabbing him
 with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me

 be not jack falstaff then am i a jack there is percy
 throwing the body down
 if your father will do me any honour so if not let
 him kill the next percy himself i look to be either
 earl or duke i can assure you
prince henry why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead
falstaff didst thou lord lord how this world is given to
 lying i grant you i was down and out of breath
 and so was he but we rose both at an instant and
 fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock if i may be
 believed so if not let them that should reward
 valour bear the sin upon their own heads i'll take
 it upon my death i gave him this wound in the
 thigh if the man were alive and would deny it
 zounds i would make him eat a piece of my sword
lancaster this is the strangest tale that ever i heard
prince henry this is the strangest fellow brother john
 come bring your luggage nobly on your back
 for my part if a lie may do thee grace
 i'll gild it with the happiest terms i have
 a retreat is sounded
 the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
 come brother let us to the highest of the field

 warwick the bishop of winchester heralds &c
bedford hung be the heavens with black yield day to night
 comets importing change of times and states
 brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
 and with them scourge the bad revolting stars
 that have consented unto henry's death
 king henry the fifth too famous to live long
 england ne'er lost a king of so much worth
gloucester england ne'er had a king until his time
 virtue he had deserving to command
 his brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams
 his arms spread wider than a dragon's wings
 his sparking eyes replete with wrathful fire
 more dazzled and drove back his enemies
 than midday sun fierce bent against their faces
 what should i say his deeds exceed all speech
 he ne'er lift up his hand but conquered
exeter we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
 henry is dead and never shall revive
 upon a wooden coffin we attend
 and death's dishonourable victory
 we with our stately presence glorify
 like captives bound to a triumphant car
 what shall we curse the planets of mishap
 that plotted thus our glory's overthrow
 or shall we think the subtlewitted french
 conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
 by magic verses have contrived his end
bishop
of winchester he was a king bless'd of the king of kings
 unto the french the dreadful judgementday
 so dreadful will not be as was his sight
 the battles of the lord of hosts he fought
 the church's prayers made him so prosperous
gloucester the church where is it had not churchmen pray'd
 his thread of life had not so soon decay'd
 none do you like but an effeminate prince
 whom like a schoolboy you may overawe
bishop
of winchester gloucester whate'er we like thou art protector
 and lookest to command the prince and realm
 thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe
 more than god or religious churchmen may
gloucester name not religion for thou lovest the flesh
 and ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
 except it be to pray against thy foes
bedford cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
 let's to the altar heralds wait on us
 instead of gold we'll offer up our arms
 since arms avail not now that henry's dead
 posterity await for wretched years
 when at their mothers moist eyes babes shall suck
 our isle be made a nourish of salt tears
 and none but women left to wail the dead

 of loss of slaughter and discomfiture
 guienne champagne rheims orleans
 paris guysors poictiers are all quite lost
bedford what say'st thou man before dead henry's corse
 speak softly or the loss of those great towns
 will make him burst his lead and rise from death
gloucester is paris lost is rouen yielded up
 if henry were recall'd to life again
 these news would cause him once more yield the ghost
exeter how were they lost what treachery was used
messenger no treachery but want of men and money
 amongst the soldiers this is muttered
 that here you maintain several factions
 and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought
 you are disputing of your generals
 one would have lingering wars with little cost
 another would fly swift but wanteth wings
 a third thinks without expense at all
 by guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd
 awake awake english nobility
 let not sloth dim your horrors newbegot
 cropp'd are the flowerdeluces in your arms
 of england's coat one half is cut away
exeter were our tears wanting to this funeral
 these tidings would call forth their flowing tides
bedford me they concern regent i am of france
 give me my steeled coat i'll fight for france
 away with these disgraceful wailing robes
 wounds will i lend the french instead of eyes
 to weep their intermissive miseries

 an army have i muster'd in my thoughts
 wherewith already france is overrun
 enter another messenger
messenger my gracious lords to add to your laments
 wherewith you now bedew king henry's hearse
 i must inform you of a dismal fight
 betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french
bishop
of winchester what wherein talbot overcame is't so
messenger o no wherein lord talbot was o'erthrown
 the circumstance i'll tell you more at large
 the tenth of august last this dreadful lord
 retiring from the siege of orleans
 having full scarce six thousand in his troop
 by three and twenty thousand of the french
 was round encompassed and set upon
 no leisure had he to enrank his men
 he wanted pikes to set before his archers
 instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
 they pitched in the ground confusedly
 to keep the horsemen off from breaking in
 more than three hours the fight continued
 where valiant talbot above human thought
 enacted wonders with his sword and lance
 hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
 here there and every where enraged he flew
 the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms
 all the whole army stood agazed on him
 his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
 a talbot a talbot cried out amain
 and rush'd into the bowels of the battle
 here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
 if sir john fastolfe had not play'd the coward
 he being in the vaward placed behind
 with purpose to relieve and follow them
 cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
 hence grew the general wreck and massacre
 enclosed were they with their enemies
 a base walloon to win the dauphin's grace
 thrust talbot with a spear into the back
 whom all france with their chief assembled strength
 durst not presume to look once in the face
bedford is talbot slain then i will slay myself
 for living idly here in pomp and ease
 whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
 unto his dastard foemen is betray'd
messenger o no he lives but is took prisoner
 and lord scales with him and lord hungerford
 most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise
bedford his ransom there is none but i shall pay
 i'll hale the dauphin headlong from his throne
 his crown shall be the ransom of my friend
 four of their lords i'll change for one of ours
 farewell my masters to my task will i
 bonfires in france forthwith i am to make
 to keep our great saint george's feast withal
 ten thousand soldiers with me i will take
 whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake
messenger so you had need for orleans is besieged
 the english army is grown weak and faint
 the earl of salisbury craveth supply
 and hardly keeps his men from mutiny
 since they so few watch such a multitude
exeter remember lords your oaths to henry sworn
 either to quell the dauphin utterly
 or bring him in obedience to your yoke
bedford i do remember it and here take my leave
 to go about my preparation
 exit
gloucester i'll to the tower with all the haste i can

 sound a flourish enter charles alencon and
 reignier marching with drum and soldiers
charles mars his true moving even as in the heavens
 so in the earth to this day is not known
 late did he shine upon the english side
 now we are victors upon us he smiles
 what towns of any moment but we have
 at pleasure here we lie near orleans
 otherwhiles the famish'd english like pale ghosts
 faintly besiege us one hour in a month
alencon they want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves
 either they must be dieted like mules
 and have their provender tied to their mouths
 or piteous they will look like drowned mice
reignier let's raise the siege why live we idly here
 talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
 remaineth none but madbrain'd salisbury
 and he may well in fretting spend his gall
 nor men nor money hath he to make war
charles sound sound alarum we will rush on them
 now for the honour of the forlorn french
 him i forgive my death that killeth me
 when he sees me go back one foot or fly
 exeunt
 here alarum they are beaten back by the english
 with great loss reenter charles alencon and reignier
charles who ever saw the like what men have i
 dogs cowards dastards i would ne'er have fled
 but that they left me midst my enemies
reignier salisbury is a desperate homicide
 he fighteth as one weary of his life
 the other lords like lions wanting food
 do rush upon us as their hungry prey
alencon froissart a countryman of ours records
 england all olivers and rowlands bred
 during the time edward the third did reign
 more truly now may this be verified
 for none but samsons and goliases
 it sendeth forth to skirmish one to ten
 lean rawboned rascals who would e'er suppose
 they had such courage and audacity
charles let's leave this town for they are harebrain'd slaves
 and hunger will enforce them to be more eager
 of old i know them rather with their teeth
 the walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege
reignier i think by some odd gimmors or device
 their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on
 else ne'er could they hold out so as they do
 by my consent we'll even let them alone
alencon be it so
 enter the bastard of orleans
bastard of orleans where's the prince dauphin i have news for him
charles bastard of orleans thrice welcome to us
bastard of orleans methinks your looks are sad your cheer appall'd
 hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
 be not dismay'd for succor is at hand
 a holy maid hither with me i bring
 which by a vision sent to her from heaven
 ordained is to raise this tedious siege
 and drive the english forth the bounds of france
 the spirit of deep prophecy she hath
 exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome
 what's past and what's to come she can descry
 speak shall i call her in believe my words
 for they are certain and unfallible
charles go call her in
 exit bastard of orleans
 but first to try her skill
 reignier stand thou as dauphin in my place
 question her proudly let thy looks be stern
 by this means shall we sound what skill she hath
 reenter the bastard of orleans with joan la pucelle
reignier fair maid is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats
joan la pucelle reignier is't thou that thinkest to beguile me
 where is the dauphin come come from behind
 i know thee well though never seen before
 be not amazed there's nothing hid from me
 in private will i talk with thee apart
 stand back you lords and give us leave awhile
reignier she takes upon her bravely at first dash
joan la pucelle dauphin i am by birth a shepherd's daughter
 my wit untrain'd in any kind of art
 heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased
 to shine on my contemptible estate
 lo whilst i waited on my tender lambs
 and to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks
 god's mother deigned to appear to me
 and in a vision full of majesty
 will'd me to leave my base vocation
 and free my country from calamity
 her aid she promised and assured success
 in complete glory she reveal'd herself
 and whereas i was black and swart before
 with those clear rays which she infused on me
 that beauty am i bless'd with which you see
 ask me what question thou canst possible
 and i will answer unpremeditated
 my courage try by combat if thou darest
 and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex
 resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
 if thou receive me for thy warlike mate
charles thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms
 only this proof i'll of thy valour make
 in single combat thou shalt buckle with me
 and if thou vanquishest thy words are true
 otherwise i renounce all confidence
joan la pucelle i am prepared here is my keenedged sword
 deck'd with five flowerdeluces on each side
 the which at touraine in saint katharine's
 churchyard
 out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth
charles then come o god's name i fear no woman
joan la pucelle and while i live i'll ne'er fly from a man
 here they fight and joan la pucelle overcomes
charles stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon
 and fightest with the sword of deborah
joan la pucelle christ's mother helps me else i were too weak
charles whoe'er helps thee tis thou that must help me
 impatiently i burn with thy desire
 my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued
 excellent pucelle if thy name be so
 let me thy servant and not sovereign be
 tis the french dauphin sueth to thee thus
joan la pucelle i must not yield to any rites of love
 for my profession's sacred from above
 when i have chased all thy foes from hence
 then will i think upon a recompense
charles meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall
reignier my lord methinks is very long in talk
alencon doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
 else ne'er could he so long protract his speech
reignier shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean
alencon he may mean more than we poor men do know
 these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues
reignier my lord where are you what devise you on
 shall we give over orleans or no
joan la pucelle why no i say distrustful recreants
 fight till the last gasp i will be your guard
charles what she says i'll confirm we'll fight it out
joan la pucelle assign'd am i to be the english scourge
 this night the siege assuredly i'll raise
 expect saint martin's summer halcyon days
 since i have entered into these wars
 glory is like a circle in the water
 which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
 till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
 with henry's death the english circle ends
 dispersed are the glories it included
 now am i like that proud insulting ship
 which caesar and his fortune bare at once
charles was mahomet inspired with a dove
 thou with an eagle art inspired then
 helen the mother of great constantine
 nor yet saint philip's daughters were like thee
 bright star of venus fall'n down on the earth
 how may i reverently worship thee enough
alencon leave off delays and let us raise the siege
reignier woman do what thou canst to save our honours
 drive them from orleans and be immortalized
charles presently we'll try come let's away about it
 no prophet will i trust if she prove false

mastergunner sirrah thou know'st how orleans is besieged
 and how the english have the suburbs won
boy father i know and oft have shot at them
 howe'er unfortunate i miss'd my aim
mastergunner but now thou shalt not be thou ruled by me
 chief mastergunner am i of this town
 something i must do to procure me grace
 the prince's espials have informed me
 how the english in the suburbs close intrench'd
 wont through a secret grate of iron bars
 in yonder tower to overpeer the city
 and thence discover how with most advantage
 they may vex us with shot or with assault
 to intercept this inconvenience
 a piece of ordnance gainst it i have placed
 and even these three days have i watch'd
 if i could see them
 now do thou watch for i can stay no longer
 if thou spy'st any run and bring me word
 and thou shalt find me at the governor's
 exit
boy father i warrant you take you no care
 i'll never trouble you if i may spy them
 exit
 enter on the turrets salisbury and talbot
 glansdale gargrave and others
salisbury talbot my life my joy again return'd
 how wert thou handled being prisoner
 or by what means got'st thou to be released
 discourse i prithee on this turret's top
talbot the duke of bedford had a prisoner
 call'd the brave lord ponton de santrailles
 for him was i exchanged and ransomed
 but with a baser man of arms by far
 once in contempt they would have barter'd me
 which i disdaining scorn'd and craved death
 rather than i would be so vile esteem'd
 in fine redeem'd i was as i desired
 but o the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart
 whom with my bare fists i would execute
 if i now had him brought into my power
salisbury yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd
talbot with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
 in open marketplace produced they me
 to be a public spectacle to all
 here said they is the terror of the french
 the scarecrow that affrights our children so
 then broke i from the officers that led me
 and with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
 to hurl at the beholders of my shame
 my grisly countenance made others fly
 none durst come near for fear of sudden death
 in iron walls they deem'd me not secure
 so great fear of my name mongst them was spread
 that they supposed i could rend bars of steel
 and spurn in pieces posts of adamant
 wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had
 that walked about me every minutewhile
 and if i did but stir out of my bed
 ready they were to shoot me to the heart
 enter the boy with a linstock
salisbury i grieve to hear what torments you endured
 but we will be revenged sufficiently
 now it is suppertime in orleans
 here through this grate i count each one
 and view the frenchmen how they fortify
 let us look in the sight will much delight thee
 sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale
 let me have your express opinions
 where is best place to make our battery next
gargrave i think at the north gate for there stand lords
glansdale and i here at the bulwark of the bridge
talbot for aught i see this city must be famish'd
 or with light skirmishes enfeebled
 here they shoot salisbury and gargrave fall
salisbury o lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
gargrave o lord have mercy on me woful man
talbot what chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us
 speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak
 how farest thou mirror of all martial men
 one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off
 accursed tower accursed fatal hand
 that hath contrived this woful tragedy
 in thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame
 henry the fifth he first train'd to the wars
 whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
 his sword did ne'er leave striking in the field
 yet livest thou salisbury though thy speech doth fail
 one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
 the sun with one eye vieweth all the world
 heaven be thou gracious to none alive
 if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
 bear hence his body i will help to bury it

 now like to whelps we crying run away
 a short alarum

 or tear the lions out of england's coat
 renounce your soil give sheep in lions stead
 sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
 or horse or oxen from the leopard

 enter talbot bedford burgundy and forces with
 scalingladders their drums beating a dead march
talbot lord regent and redoubted burgundy
 by whose approach the regions of artois
 wallon and picardy are friends to us
 this happy night the frenchmen are secure
 having all day caroused and banqueted
 embrace we then this opportunity
 as fitting best to quittance their deceit
 contrived by art and baleful sorcery
bedford coward of france how much he wrongs his fame
 despairing of his own arm's fortitude
 to join with witches and the help of hell
burgundy traitors have never other company
 but what's that pucelle whom they term so pure
talbot a maid they say
bedford a maid and be so martial
burgundy pray god she prove not masculine ere long
 if underneath the standard of the french
 she carry armour as she hath begun
talbot well let them practise and converse with spirits
 god is our fortress in whose conquering name
 let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks
bedford ascend brave talbot we will follow thee
talbot not all together better far i guess
 that we do make our entrance several ways
 that if it chance the one of us do fail
 the other yet may rise against their force
bedford agreed i'll to yond corner
burgundy and i to this
talbot and here will talbot mount or make his grave

bastard of orleans unready ay and glad we scaped so well
reignier twas time i trow to wake and leave our beds
 hearing alarums at our chamberdoors
alencon of all exploits since first i follow'd arms
 ne'er heard i of a warlike enterprise
 more venturous or desperate than this
bastard of orleans i think this talbot be a fiend of hell
reignier if not of hell the heavens sure favour him
alencon here cometh charles i marvel how he sped
bastard of orleans tut holy joan was his defensive guard
 enter charles and joan la pucelle
charles is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
 didst thou at first to flatter us withal
 make us partakers of a little gain
 that now our loss might be ten times so much
joan la pucelle wherefore is charles impatient with his friend
 at all times will you have my power alike
 sleeping or waking must i still prevail
 or will you blame and lay the fault on me
 improvident soldiers had your watch been good
 this sudden mischief never could have fall'n
charles duke of alencon this was your default
 that being captain of the watch tonight
 did look no better to that weighty charge
alencon had all your quarters been as safely kept
 as that whereof i had the government
 we had not been thus shamefully surprised
bastard of orleans mine was secure
reignier and so was mine my lord
charles and for myself most part of all this night
 within her quarter and mine own precinct
 i was employ'd in passing to and fro
 about relieving of the sentinels
 then how or which way should they first break in
joan la pucelle question my lords no further of the case
 how or which way tis sure they found some place
 but weakly guarded where the breach was made
 and now there rests no other shift but this
 to gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispersed
 and lay new platforms to endamage them
 alarum enter an english soldier crying a
 talbot a talbot they fly leaving their
 clothes behind
soldier i'll be so bold to take what they have left
 the cry of talbot serves me for a sword

 retreat sounded
talbot bring forth the body of old salisbury
 and here advance it in the marketplace
 the middle centre of this cursed town
 now have i paid my vow unto his soul
 for every drop of blood was drawn from him
 there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight
 and that hereafter ages may behold
 what ruin happen'd in revenge of him
 within their chiefest temple i'll erect
 a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr'd
 upon the which that every one may read
 shall be engraved the sack of orleans
 the treacherous manner of his mournful death
 and what a terror he had been to france
 but lords in all our bloody massacre
 i muse we met not with the dauphin's grace
 his newcome champion virtuous joan of arc
 nor any of his false confederates

 roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds
 they did amongst the troops of armed men
 leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field
burgundy myself as far as i could well discern
 for smoke and dusky vapours of the night
 am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull
 when arm in arm they both came swiftly running
 like to a pair of loving turtledoves
 that could not live asunder day or night
 after that things are set in order here
 we'll follow them with all the power we have

 call ye the warlike talbot for his acts

 by me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
 to visit her poor castle where she lies
 that she may boast she hath beheld the man
 whose glory fills the world with loud report
burgundy is it even so nay then i see our wars
 will turn unto a peaceful comic sport
 when ladies crave to be encounter'd with
 you may not my lord despise her gentle suit
talbot ne'er trust me then for when a world of men
 could not prevail with all their oratory
 yet hath a woman's kindness overruled
 and therefore tell her i return great thanks
 and in submission will attend on her
 will not your honours bear me company
bedford no truly it is more than manners will
 and i have heard it said unbidden guests
 are often welcomest when they are gone
talbot well then alone since there's no remedy

 is this the talbot so much fear'd abroad
 that with his name the mothers still their babes
 i see report is fabulous and false
 i thought i should have seen some hercules
 a second hector for his grim aspect
 and large proportion of his strongknit limbs
 alas this is a child a silly dwarf
 it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
 should strike such terror to his enemies
talbot madam i have been bold to trouble you
 but since your ladyship is not at leisure
 i'll sort some other time to visit you

 long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
 for in my gallery thy picture hangs
 but now the substance shall endure the like
 and i will chain these legs and arms of thine
 that hast by tyranny these many years
 wasted our country slain our citizens
 and sent our sons and husbands captivate
talbot ha ha ha

of auvergne laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moan
talbot i laugh to see your ladyship so fond

 whereon to practise your severity

talbot i am indeed
countess
of auvergne then have i substance too
talbot no no i am but shadow of myself
 you are deceived my substance is not here
 for what you see is but the smallest part
 and least proportion of humanity
 i tell you madam were the whole frame here
 it is of such a spacious lofty pitch
 your roof were not sufficient to contain't
countess
of auvergne this is a riddling merchant for the nonce
 he will be here and yet he is not here
 how can these contrarieties agree
talbot that will i show you presently
 winds his horn drums strike up a peal of
 ordnance enter soldiers
 how say you madam are you now persuaded
 that talbot is but shadow of himself
 these are his substance sinews arms and strength
 with which he yoketh your rebellious necks
 razeth your cities and subverts your towns
 and in a moment makes them desolate
countess
of auvergne victorious talbot pardon my abuse
 i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
 and more than may be gather'd by thy shape
 let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
 for i am sorry that with reverence
 i did not entertain thee as thou art
talbot be not dismay'd fair lady nor misconstrue
 the mind of talbot as you did mistake
 the outward composition of his body
 what you have done hath not offended me
 nor other satisfaction do i crave
 but only with your patience that we may
 taste of your wine and see what cates you have
 for soldiers stomachs always serve them well

richard
plantagenet great lords and gentlemen what means this silence
 dare no man answer in a case of truth
suffolk within the templehall we were too loud
 the garden here is more convenient
richard
plantagenet then say at once if i maintain'd the truth
 or else was wrangling somerset in the error
suffolk faith i have been a truant in the law
 and never yet could frame my will to it
 and therefore frame the law unto my will
somerset judge you my lord of warwick then between us
warwick between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
 between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
 between two blades which bears the better temper
 between two horses which doth bear him best
 between two girls which hath the merriest eye
 i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement
 but in these nice sharp quillets of the law
 good faith i am no wiser than a daw
richard
plantagenet tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
 the truth appears so naked on my side
 that any purblind eye may find it out
somerset and on my side it is so well apparell'd
 so clear so shining and so evident
 that it will glimmer through a blind man's eye
richard
plantagenet since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak
 in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
 let him that is a trueborn gentleman
 and stands upon the honour of his birth
 if he suppose that i have pleaded truth
 from off this brier pluck a white rose with me
somerset let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
 but dare maintain the party of the truth
 pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
warwick i love no colours and without all colour
 of base insinuating flattery
 i pluck this white rose with plantagenet
suffolk i pluck this red rose with young somerset
 and say withal i think he held the right
vernon stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
 till you conclude that he upon whose side
 the fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
 shall yield the other in the right opinion
somerset good master vernon it is well objected
 if i have fewest i subscribe in silence
richard
plantagenet and i
vernon then for the truth and plainness of the case
 i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
 giving my verdict on the white rose side
somerset prick not your finger as you pluck it off
 lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
 and fall on my side so against your will
vernon if i my lord for my opinion bleed
 opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
 and keep me on the side where still i am
somerset well well come on who else
lawyer unless my study and my books be false
 the argument you held was wrong in you
 to somerset
 in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
richard
plantagenet now somerset where is your argument
somerset here in my scabbard meditating that
 shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
richard
plantagenet meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses
 for pale they look with fear as witnessing
 the truth on our side
somerset no plantagenet
 tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
 blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
 and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
richard
plantagenet hath not thy rose a canker somerset
somerset hath not thy rose a thorn plantagenet
richard
plantagenet ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
 whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
somerset well i'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
 that shall maintain what i have said is true
 where false plantagenet dare not be seen
richard
plantagenet now by this maiden blossom in my hand
 i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
suffolk turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet
richard
plantagenet proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee
suffolk i'll turn my part thereof into thy throat
somerset away away good william de la pole
 we grace the yeoman by conversing with him
warwick now by god's will thou wrong'st him somerset
 his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence
 third son to the third edward king of england
 spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
richard
plantagenet he bears him on the place's privilege
 or durst not for his craven heart say thus
somerset by him that made me i'll maintain my words
 on any plot of ground in christendom
 was not thy father richard earl of cambridge
 for treason executed in our late king's days
 and by his treason stand'st not thou attainted
 corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
 his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
 and till thou be restored thou art a yeoman
richard
plantagenet my father was attached not attainted
 condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor
 and that i'll prove on better men than somerset
 were growing time once ripen'd to my will
 for your partaker pole and you yourself
 i'll note you in my book of memory
 to scourge you for this apprehension
 look to it well and say you are well warn'd
somerset ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still
 and know us by these colours for thy foes
 for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
richard
plantagenet and by my soul this pale and angry rose
 as cognizance of my blooddrinking hate
 will i for ever and my faction wear
 until it wither with me to my grave
 or flourish to the height of my degree
suffolk go forward and be choked with thy ambition
 and so farewell until i meet thee next
 exit
somerset have with thee pole farewell ambitious richard
 exit
richard
plantagenet how i am braved and must perforce endure it
warwick this blot that they object against your house
 shall be wiped out in the next parliament
 call'd for the truce of winchester and gloucester
 and if thou be not then created york
 i will not live to be accounted warwick
 meantime in signal of my love to thee
 against proud somerset and william pole
 will i upon thy party wear this rose
 and here i prophesy this brawl today
 grown to this faction in the templegarden
 shall send between the red rose and the white
 a thousand souls to death and deadly night
richard
plantagenet good master vernon i am bound to you
 that you on my behalf would pluck a flower
vernon in your behalf still will i wear the same

mortimer kind keepers of my weak decaying age
 let dying mortimer here rest himself
 even like a man new haled from the rack
 so fare my limbs with long imprisonment
 and these grey locks the pursuivants of death
 nestorlike aged in an age of care
 argue the end of edmund mortimer
 these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
 wax dim as drawing to their exigent
 weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief
 and pithless arms like to a wither'd vine
 that droops his sapless branches to the ground
 yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
 unable to support this lump of clay
 swiftwinged with desire to get a grave
 as witting i no other comfort have
 but tell me keeper will my nephew come
first gaoler richard plantagenet my lord will come
 we sent unto the temple unto his chamber
 and answer was return'd that he will come
mortimer enough my soul shall then be satisfied
 poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
 since henry monmouth first began to reign
 before whose glory i was great in arms
 this loathsome sequestration have i had
 and even since then hath richard been obscured
 deprived of honour and inheritance
 but now the arbitrator of despairs
 just death kind umpire of men's miseries
 with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
 i would his troubles likewise were expired
 that so he might recover what was lost
 enter richard plantagenet
first gaoler my lord your loving nephew now is come
mortimer richard plantagenet my friend is he come
richard
plantagenet ay noble uncle thus ignobly used
 your nephew late despised richard comes
mortimer direct mine arms i may embrace his neck
 and in his bosom spend my latter gasp
 o tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
 that i may kindly give one fainting kiss
 and now declare sweet stem from york's great stock
 why didst thou say of late thou wert despised
richard
plantagenet first lean thine aged back against mine arm
 and in that ease i'll tell thee my disease
 this day in argument upon a case
 some words there grew twixt somerset and me
 among which terms he used his lavish tongue
 and did upbraid me with my father's death
 which obloquy set bars before my tongue
 else with the like i had requited him
 therefore good uncle for my father's sake
 in honour of a true plantagenet
 and for alliance sake declare the cause
 my father earl of cambridge lost his head
mortimer that cause fair nephew that imprison'd me
 and hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
 within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
 was cursed instrument of his decease
richard
plantagenet discover more at large what cause that was
 for i am ignorant and cannot guess
mortimer i will if that my fading breath permit
 and death approach not ere my tale be done
 henry the fourth grandfather to this king
 deposed his nephew richard edward's son
 the firstbegotten and the lawful heir
 of edward king the third of that descent
 during whose reign the percies of the north
 finding his usurpation most unjust
 endeavor'd my advancement to the throne
 the reason moved these warlike lords to this
 was for thatyoung king richard thus removed
 leaving no heir begotten of his body
 i was the next by birth and parentage
 for by my mother i derived am
 from lionel duke of clarence the third son
 to king edward the third whereas he
 from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree
 being but fourth of that heroic line
 but mark as in this haughty attempt
 they laboured to plant the rightful heir
 i lost my liberty and they their lives
 long after this when henry the fifth
 succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign
 thy father earl of cambridge then derived
 from famous edmund langley duke of york
 marrying my sister that thy mother was
 again in pity of my hard distress
 levied an army weening to redeem
 and have install'd me in the diadem
 but as the rest so fell that noble earl
 and was beheaded thus the mortimers
 in whom the tide rested were suppress'd
richard
plantagenet of which my lord your honour is the last
mortimer true and thou seest that i no issue have
 and that my fainting words do warrant death
 thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather
 but yet be wary in thy studious care
richard
plantagenet thy grave admonishments prevail with me
 but yet methinks my father's execution
 was nothing less than bloody tyranny
mortimer with silence nephew be thou politic
 strongfixed is the house of lancaster
 and like a mountain not to be removed
 but now thy uncle is removing hence
 as princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
 with long continuance in a settled place
richard
plantagenet o uncle would some part of my young years
 might but redeem the passage of your age
mortimer thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth
 which giveth many wounds when one will kill
 mourn not except thou sorrow for my good
 only give order for my funeral
 and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
 and prosperous be thy life in peace and war
 dies
richard
plantagenet and peace no war befall thy parting soul
 in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
 and like a hermit overpass'd thy days
 well i will lock his counsel in my breast
 and what i do imagine let that rest
 keepers convey him hence and i myself
 will see his burial better than his life
 exeunt gaolers bearing out the body of mortimer
 here dies the dusky torch of mortimer
 choked with ambition of the meaner sort
 and for those wrongs those bitter injuries
 which somerset hath offer'd to my house
 i doubt not but with honour to redress
 and therefore haste i to the parliament
 either to be restored to my blood
 or make my ill the advantage of my good

 purpose to answer what thou canst object
gloucester presumptuous priest this place commands my patience
 or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me
 think not although in writing i preferr'd
 the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
 that therefore i have forged or am not able
 verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
 no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
 thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
 as very infants prattle of thy pride
 thou art a most pernicious usurer
 forward by nature enemy to peace
 lascivious wanton more than well beseems
 a man of thy profession and degree
 and for thy treachery what's more manifest
 in that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
 as well at london bridge as at the tower

 and for dissension who preferreth peace
 more than i doexcept i be provoked
 no my good lords it is not that offends
 it is not that that hath incensed the duke

 forbidden late to carry any weapon
 have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
 and banding themselves in contrary parts
 do pelt so fast at one another's pate
 that many have their giddy brains knock'd out
 our windows are broke down in every street
 and we for fear compell'd to shut our shops
 enter servingmen in skirmish with bloody pates
king henry vi we charge you on allegiance to ourself
 to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace
 pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife
first servingman nay if we be forbidden stones
 we'll fall to it with our teeth
second servingman do what ye dare we are as resolute
 skirmish again
gloucester you of my household leave this peevish broil
 and set this unaccustom'd fight aside
third servingman my lord we know your grace to be a man
 just and upright and for your royal birth
 inferior to none but to his majesty
 and ere that we will suffer such a prince
 so kind a father of the commonweal
 to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
 we and our wives and children all will fight
 and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes
first servingman ay and the very parings of our nails
 shall pitch a field when we are dead
 begin again
gloucester stay stay i say
 and if you love me as you say you do
 let me persuade you to forbear awhile
king henry vi o how this discord doth afflict my soul
 can you my lord of winchester behold
 my sighs and tears and will not once relent
 who should be pitiful if you be not
 or who should study to prefer a peace
 if holy churchmen take delight in broils
warwick yield my lord protector yield winchester
 except you mean with obstinate repulse
 to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
 you see what mischief and what murder too
 hath been enacted through your enmity
 then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
bishop
of winchester he shall submit or i will never yield
gloucester compassion on the king commands me stoop
 or i would see his heart out ere the priest
 should ever get that privilege of me
warwick behold my lord of winchester the duke
 hath banish'd moody discontented fury
 as by his smoothed brows it doth appear
 why look you still so stern and tragical
gloucester here winchester i offer thee my hand
king henry vi fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach
 that malice was a great and grievous sin
 and will not you maintain the thing you teach
 but prove a chief offender in the same
warwick sweet king the bishop hath a kindly gird
 for shame my lord of winchester relent
 what shall a child instruct you what to do
bishop
of winchester well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee
 love for thy love and hand for hand i give
gloucester aside ay but i fear me with a hollow heart
 see here my friends and loving countrymen
 this token serveth for a flag of truce
 betwixt ourselves and all our followers
 so help me god as i dissemble not
bishop
of winchester aside so help me god as i intend it not
king henry vi o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester
 how joyful am i made by this contract
 away my masters trouble us no more
 but join in friendship as your lords have done
first servingman content i'll to the surgeon's
second servingman and so will i
third servingman and i will see what physic the tavern affords
 exeunt servingmen mayor &c
warwick accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
 which in the right of richard plantagenet
 we do exhibit to your majesty
gloucester well urged my lord of warwick or sweet prince
 and if your grace mark every circumstance
 you have great reason to do richard right
 especially for those occasions
 at eltham place i told your majesty
king henry vi and those occasions uncle were of force
 therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
 that richard be restored to his blood
warwick let richard be restored to his blood
 so shall his father's wrongs be recompensed
bishop
of winchester as will the rest so willeth winchester
king henry vi if richard will be true not that alone
 but all the whole inheritance i give
 that doth belong unto the house of york
 from whence you spring by lineal descent
richard
plantagenet thy humble servant vows obedience
 and humble service till the point of death
king henry vi stoop then and set your knee against my foot
 and in reguerdon of that duty done
 i gird thee with the valiant sword of york
 rise richard like a true plantagenet
 and rise created princely duke of york
richard
plantagenet and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall
 and as my duty springs so perish they
 that grudge one thought against your majesty
all welcome high prince the mighty duke of york
somerset aside perish base prince ignoble duke of york
gloucester now will it best avail your majesty
 to cross the seas and to be crown'd in france
 the presence of a king engenders love
 amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
 as it disanimates his enemies
king henry vi when gloucester says the word king henry goes
 for friendly counsel cuts off many foes
gloucester your ships already are in readiness
 sennet flourish exeunt all but exeter
exeter ay we may march in england or in france
 not seeing what is likely to ensue
 this late dissension grown betwixt the peers
 burns under feigned ashes of forged love
 and will at last break out into a flame
 as fester'd members rot but by degree
 till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
 so will this base and envious discord breed
 and now i fear that fatal prophecy
 which in the time of henry named the fifth
 was in the mouth of every sucking babe
 that henry born at monmouth should win all
 and henry born at windsor lose all
 which is so plain that exeter doth wish
 his days may finish ere that hapless time

 great coeurdelion's heart was buried
 so sure i swear to get the town or die
burgundy my vows are equal partners with thy vows
talbot but ere we go regard this dying prince

 fitter for sickness and for crazy age
bedford lord talbot do not so dishonour me
 here will i sit before the walls of rouen
 and will be partner of your weal or woe
burgundy courageous bedford let us now persuade you
bedford not to be gone from hence for once i read
 that stout pendragon in his litter sick
 came to the field and vanquished his foes
 methinks i should revive the soldiers hearts
 because i ever found them as myself
talbot undaunted spirit in a dying breast
 then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe
 and now no more ado brave burgundy

 this is a double honour burgundy
 yet heavens have glory for this victory
burgundy warlike and martial talbot burgundy

talbot thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now
 i think her old familiar is asleep
 now where's the bastard's braves and charles his gleeks
 what all amort rouen hangs her head for grief
 that such a valiant company are fled
 now will we take some order in the town
 placing therein some expert officers
 and then depart to paris to the king
 for there young henry with his nobles lie
burgundy what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy
talbot but yet before we go let's not forget
 the noble duke of bedford late deceased
 but see his exequies fulfill'd in rouen
 a braver soldier never couched lance
 a gentler heart did never sway in court
 but kings and mightiest potentates must die
 for that's the end of human misery

scene iii the plains near rouen
 enter charles the bastard of orleans alencon joan
 la pucelle and forces
joan la pucelle dismay not princes at this accident
 nor grieve that rouen is so recovered
 care is no cure but rather corrosive
 for things that are not to be remedied
 let frantic talbot triumph for a while
 and like a peacock sweep along his tail
 we'll pull his plumes and take away his train
 if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled
charles we have been guided by thee hitherto
 and of thy cunning had no diffidence
 one sudden foil shall never breed distrust
bastard of orleans search out thy wit for secret policies
 and we will make thee famous through the world
alencon we'll set thy statue in some holy place
 and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint
 employ thee then sweet virgin for our good
joan la pucelle then thus it must be this doth joan devise
 by fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
 we will entice the duke of burgundy
 to leave the talbot and to follow us
charles ay marry sweeting if we could do that
 france were no place for henry's warriors
 nor should that nation boast it so with us
 but be extirped from our provinces
alencon for ever should they be expulsed from france
 and not have title of an earldom here
joan la pucelle your honours shall perceive how i will work
 to bring this matter to the wished end
 drum sounds afar off
 hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
 their powers are marching unto parisward
 here sound an english march enter and pass over
 at a distance talbot and his forces
 there goes the talbot with his colours spread
 and all the troops of english after him
 french march enter burgundy and forces
 now in the rearward comes the duke and his
 fortune in favour makes him lag behind
 summon a parley we will talk with him
 trumpets sound a parley
charles a parley with the duke of burgundy
burgundy who craves a parley with the burgundy
joan la pucelle the princely charles of france thy countryman
burgundy what say'st thou charles for i am marching hence
charles speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words
joan la pucelle brave burgundy undoubted hope of france
 stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee
burgundy speak on but be not overtedious
joan la pucelle look on thy country look on fertile france
 and see the cities and the towns defaced
 by wasting ruin of the cruel foe
 as looks the mother on her lowly babe
 when death doth close his tender dying eyes
 see see the pining malady of france
 behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
 which thou thyself hast given her woful breast
 o turn thy edged sword another way
 strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
 one drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
 should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
 return thee therefore with a flood of tears
 and wash away thy country's stained spots
burgundy either she hath bewitch'd me with her words
 or nature makes me suddenly relent
joan la pucelle besides all french and france exclaims on thee
 doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
 who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
 that will not trust thee but for profit's sake
 when talbot hath set footing once in france
 and fashion'd thee that instrument of ill
 who then but english henry will be lord
 and thou be thrust out like a fugitive
 call we to mind and mark but this for proof
 was not the duke of orleans thy foe
 and was he not in england prisoner
 but when they heard he was thine enemy
 they set him free without his ransom paid
 in spite of burgundy and all his friends
 see then thou fight'st against thy countrymen
 and joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen
 come come return return thou wandering lord
 charles and the rest will take thee in their arms
burgundy i am vanquished these haughty words of hers
 have batter'd me like roaring cannonshot
 and made me almost yield upon my knees
 forgive me country and sweet countrymen
 and lords accept this hearty kind embrace
 my forces and my power of men are yours
 so farewell talbot i'll no longer trust thee
joan la pucelle aside done like a frenchman turn and turn again
charles welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh
bastard of orleans and doth beget new courage in our breasts
alencon pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this
 and doth deserve a coronet of gold
charles now let us on my lords and join our powers
 and seek how we may prejudice the foe

 a stouter champion never handled sword
 long since we were resolved of your truth
 your faithful service and your toil in war

 enter fastolfe
fastolfe my gracious sovereign as i rode from calais
 to haste unto your coronation
 a letter was deliver'd to my hands
 writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy
talbot shame to the duke of burgundy and thee
 i vow'd base knight when i did meet thee next
 to tear the garter from thy craven's leg
 plucking it off
 which i have done because unworthily
 thou wast installed in that high degree
 pardon me princely henry and the rest
 this dastard at the battle of patay
 when but in all i was six thousand strong
 and that the french were almost ten to one
 before we met or that a stroke was given
 like to a trusty squire did run away
 in which assault we lost twelve hundred men
 myself and divers gentlemen beside
 were there surprised and taken prisoners
 then judge great lords if i have done amiss
 or whether that such cowards ought to wear
 this ornament of knighthood yea or no
gloucester to say the truth this fact was infamous
 and ill beseeming any common man
 much more a knight a captain and a leader
talbot when first this order was ordain'd my lords
 knights of the garter were of noble birth
 valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
 such as were grown to credit by the wars
 not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
 but always resolute in most extremes
 he then that is not furnish'd in this sort
 doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
 profaning this most honourable order
 and should if i were worthy to be judge
 be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain
 that doth presume to boast of gentle blood
king henry vi stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom
 be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
 henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
 exit fastolfe
 and now my lord protector view the letter
 sent from our uncle duke of burgundy
gloucester what means his grace that he hath changed his style
 no more but plain and bluntly to the king'
 hath he forgot he is his sovereign
 or doth this churlish superscription
 pretend some alteration in good will
 what's here
 reads
 i have upon especial cause
 moved with compassion of my country's wreck
 together with the pitiful complaints
 of such as your oppression feeds upon
 forsaken your pernicious faction
 and join'd with charles the rightful king of france'
 o monstrous treachery can this be so
 that in alliance amity and oaths
 there should be found such false dissembling guile
king henry vi what doth my uncle burgundy revolt
gloucester he doth my lord and is become your foe
king henry vi is that the worst this letter doth contain
gloucester it is the worst and all my lord he writes
king henry vi why then lord talbot there shall talk with him
 and give him chastisement for this abuse
 how say you my lord are you not content
talbot content my liege yes but that i am prevented
 i should have begg'd i might have been employ'd
king henry vi then gather strength and march unto him straight
 let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
 and what offence it is to flout his friends
talbot i go my lord in heart desiring still
 you may behold confusion of your foes

 say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim
 and wherefore crave you combat or with whom
vernon with him my lord for he hath done me wrong
basset and i with him for he hath done me wrong
king henry vi what is that wrong whereof you both complain
 first let me know and then i'll answer you
basset crossing the sea from england into france
 this fellow here with envious carping tongue
 upbraided me about the rose i wear
 saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
 did represent my master's blushing cheeks
 when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
 about a certain question in the law
 argued betwixt the duke of york and him
 with other vile and ignominious terms
 in confutation of which rude reproach
 and in defence of my lord's worthiness
 i crave the benefit of law of arms
vernon and that is my petition noble lord
 for though he seem with forged quaint conceit
 to set a gloss upon his bold intent
 yet know my lord i was provoked by him
 and he first took exceptions at this badge
 pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
 bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart
york will not this malice somerset be left
somerset your private grudge my lord of york will out
 though ne'er so cunningly you smother it
king henry vi good lord what madness rules in brainsick men
 when for so slight and frivolous a cause
 such factious emulations shall arise
 good cousins both of york and somerset
 quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace
york let this dissension first be tried by fight
 and then your highness shall command a peace
somerset the quarrel toucheth none but us alone
 betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
york there is my pledge accept it somerset
vernon nay let it rest where it began at first
basset confirm it so mine honourable lord
gloucester confirm it so confounded be your strife
 and perish ye with your audacious prate
 presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed
 with this immodest clamorous outrage
 to trouble and disturb the king and us
 and you my lords methinks you do not well
 to bear with their perverse objections
 much less to take occasion from their mouths
 to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
 let me persuade you take a better course
exeter it grieves his highness good my lords be friends
king henry vi come hither you that would be combatants
 henceforth i charge you as you love our favour
 quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
 and you my lords remember where we are
 in france amongst a fickle wavering nation
 if they perceive dissension in our looks
 and that within ourselves we disagree
 how will their grudging stomachs be provoked
 to wilful disobedience and rebel
 beside what infamy will there arise
 when foreign princes shall be certified
 that for a toy a thing of no regard
 king henry's peers and chief nobility
 destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of france
 o think upon the conquest of my father
 my tender years and let us not forego
 that for a trifle that was bought with blood
 let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
 i see no reason if i wear this rose
 putting on a red rose
 that any one should therefore be suspicious
 i more incline to somerset than york
 both are my kinsmen and i love them both
 as well they may upbraid me with my crown
 because forsooth the king of scots is crown'd
 but your discretions better can persuade
 than i am able to instruct or teach
 and therefore as we hither came in peace
 so let us still continue peace and love
 cousin of york we institute your grace
 to be our regent in these parts of france
 and good my lord of somerset unite
 your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
 and like true subjects sons of your progenitors
 go cheerfully together and digest
 your angry choler on your enemies

 prettily methought did play the orator

 for had the passions of thy heart burst out
 i fear we should have seen decipher'd there
 more rancorous spite more furious raging broils

 this jarring discord of nobility
 this shouldering of each other in the court
 this factious bandying of their favourites
 but that it doth presage some ill event
 tis much when sceptres are in children's hands

 that talbot's name might be in thee revived
 when sapless age and weak unable limbs
 should bring thy father to his drooping chair
 but o malignant and illboding stars
 now thou art come unto a feast of death
 a terrible and unavoided danger
 therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
 and i'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
 by sudden flight come dally not be gone
john talbot is my name talbot and am i your son
 and shall i fly o if you love my mother
 dishonour not her honourable name
 to make a bastard and a slave of me
 the world will say he is not talbot's blood
 that basely fled when noble talbot stood
talbot fly to revenge my death if i be slain
john talbot he that flies so will ne'er return again
talbot if we both stay we both are sure to die
john talbot then let me stay and father do you fly
 your loss is great so your regard should be
 my worth unknown no loss is known in me
 upon my death the french can little boast
 in yours they will in you all hopes are lost
 flight cannot stain the honour you have won
 but mine it will that no exploit have done
 you fled for vantage everyone will swear
 but if i bow they'll say it was for fear
 there is no hope that ever i will stay
 if the first hour i shrink and run away
 here on my knee i beg mortality
 rather than life preserved with infamy
talbot shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb
john talbot ay rather than i'll shame my mother's womb
talbot upon my blessing i command thee go
john talbot to fight i will but not to fly the foe
talbot part of thy father may be saved in thee
john talbot no part of him but will be shame in me
talbot thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it
john talbot yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it
talbot thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain
john talbot you cannot witness for me being slain
 if death be so apparent then both fly
talbot and leave my followers here to fight and die
 my age was never tainted with such shame
john talbot and shall my youth be guilty of such blame
 no more can i be sever'd from your side
 than can yourself yourself in twain divide
 stay go do what you will the like do i
 for live i will not if my father die
talbot then here i take my leave of thee fair son
 born to eclipse thy life this afternoon
 come side by side together live and die

 to hazard all our lives in one small boat
 if i today die not with frenchmen's rage

 tis but the shortening of my life one day
 in thee thy mother dies our household's name

 all these and more we hazard by thy stay
 all these are saved if thou wilt fly away
john talbot the sword of orleans hath not made me smart
 these words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart
 on that advantage bought with such a shame
 to save a paltry life and slay bright fame
 before young talbot from old talbot fly
 the coward horse that bears me fail and die
 and like me to the peasant boys of france
 to be shame's scorn and subject of mischance

 for god's sake let him have em to keep them here

 the king of naples whosoe'er thou art
suffolk an earl i am and suffolk am i call'd
 be not offended nature's miracle
 thou art allotted to be ta'en by me
 so doth the swan her downy cygnets save
 keeping them prisoner underneath her wings
 yet if this servile usage once offend
 go and be free again as suffolk's friend
 she is going
 o stay i have no power to let her pass
 my hand would free her but my heart says no
 as plays the sun upon the glassy streams
 twinkling another counterfeited beam
 so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
 fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak
 i'll call for pen and ink and write my mind
 fie de la pole disable not thyself
 hast not a tongue is she not here
 wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight
 ay beauty's princely majesty is such
 confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
margaret say earl of suffolkif thy name be so
 what ransom must i pay before i pass
 for i perceive i am thy prisoner
suffolk how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
 before thou make a trial of her love
margaret why speak'st thou not what ransom must i pay
suffolk she's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd
 she is a woman therefore to be won
margaret wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no
suffolk fond man remember that thou hast a wife
 then how can margaret be thy paramour
margaret i were best to leave him for he will not hear
suffolk there all is marr'd there lies a cooling card
margaret he talks at random sure the man is mad
suffolk and yet a dispensation may be had
margaret and yet i would that you would answer me
suffolk i'll win this lady margaret for whom
 why for my king tush that's a wooden thing
margaret he talks of wood it is some carpenter
suffolk yet so my fancy may be satisfied
 and peace established between these realms
 but there remains a scruple in that too
 for though her father be the king of naples
 duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor
 and our nobility will scorn the match
margaret hear ye captain are you not at leisure
suffolk it shall be so disdain they ne'er so much
 henry is youthful and will quickly yield
 madam i have a secret to reveal
margaret what though i be enthrall'd he seems a knight
 and will not any way dishonour me
suffolk lady vouchsafe to listen what i say
margaret perhaps i shall be rescued by the french
 and then i need not crave his courtesy
suffolk sweet madam give me a hearing in a cause
margaret tush women have been captivate ere now
suffolk lady wherefore talk you so
margaret i cry you mercy tis but quid for quo
suffolk say gentle princess would you not suppose
 your bondage happy to be made a queen
margaret to be a queen in bondage is more vile
 than is a slave in base servility
 for princes should be free
suffolk and so shall you
 if happy england's royal king be free
margaret why what concerns his freedom unto me
suffolk i'll undertake to make thee henry's queen
 to put a golden sceptre in thy hand
 and set a precious crown upon thy head

 give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith
suffolk reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks

 to be mine own attorney in this case
 i'll over then to england with this news
 and make this marriage to be solemnized
 so farewell reignier set this diamond safe
 in golden palaces as it becomes
reignier i do embrace thee as i would embrace
 the christian prince king henry were he here
margaret farewell my lord good wishes praise and prayers
 shall suffolk ever have of margaret
 going
suffolk farewell sweet madam but hark you margaret
 no princely commendations to my king
margaret such commendations as becomes a maid
 a virgin and his servant say to him
suffolk words sweetly placed and modestly directed
 but madam i must trouble you again
 no loving token to his majesty
margaret yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart
 never yet taint with love i send the king
suffolk and this withal
 kisses her
margaret that for thyself i will not so presume
 to send such peevish tokens to a king

 there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk

 by sight of these our baleful enemies
cardinal
of winchester charles and the rest it is enacted thus
 that in regard king henry gives consent
 of mere compassion and of lenity
 to ease your country of distressful war
 and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
 you shall become true liegemen to his crown
 and charles upon condition thou wilt swear
 to pay him tribute submit thyself
 thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him
 and still enjoy thy regal dignity
alencon must he be then as shadow of himself
 adorn his temples with a coronet
 and yet in substance and authority
 retain but privilege of a private man
 this proffer is absurd and reasonless
charles tis known already that i am possess'd
 with more than half the gallian territories
 and therein reverenced for their lawful king
 shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd
 detract so much from that prerogative
 as to be call'd but viceroy of the whole
 no lord ambassador i'll rather keep
 that which i have than coveting for more
 be cast from possibility of all
york insulting charles hast thou by secret means
 used intercession to obtain a league
 and now the matter grows to compromise
 stand'st thou aloof upon comparison
 either accept the title thou usurp'st
 of benefit proceeding from our king
 and not of any challenge of desert
 or we will plague thee with incessant wars
reignier my lord you do not well in obstinacy
 to cavil in the course of this contract
 if once it be neglected ten to one
 we shall not find like opportunity
alencon to say the truth it is your policy
 to save your subjects from such massacre
 and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
 by our proceeding in hostility
 and therefore take this compact of a truce
 although you break it when your pleasure serves
warwick how say'st thou charles shall our condition stand
charles it shall
 only reserved you claim no interest
 in any of our towns of garrison
york then swear allegiance to his majesty
 as thou art knight never to disobey
 nor be rebellious to the crown of england
 thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england
 so now dismiss your army when ye please
 hang up your ensign let your drums be still
 for here we entertain a solemn peace

 1 king henry vi
act v
scene v london the palace
 enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi
 gloucester and exeter
king henry vi your wondrous rare description noble earl
 of beauteous margaret hath astonish'd me
 her virtues graced with external gifts
 do breed love's settled passions in my heart
 and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
 provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
 so am i driven by breath of her renown
 either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
 where i may have fruition of her love
suffolk tush my good lord this superficial tale
 is but a preface of her worthy praise
 the chief perfections of that lovely dame
 had i sufficient skill to utter them
 would make a volume of enticing lines
 able to ravish any dull conceit
 and which is more she is not so divine
 so fullreplete with choice of all delights
 but with as humble lowliness of mind
 she is content to be at your command
 command i mean of virtuous chaste intents
 to love and honour henry as her lord
king henry vi and otherwise will henry ne'er presume
 therefore my lord protector give consent
 that margaret may be england's royal queen
gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin
 you know my lord your highness is betroth'd
 unto another lady of esteem
 how shall we then dispense with that contract
 and not deface your honour with reproach
suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
 or one that at a triumph having vow'd
 to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
 by reason of his adversary's odds
 a poor earl's daughter is unequal odds
 and therefore may be broke without offence
gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than that
 her father is no better than an earl
 although in glorious titles he excel
suffolk yes lord her father is a king
 the king of naples and jerusalem
 and of such great authority in france
 as his alliance will confirm our peace
 and keep the frenchmen in allegiance
gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do
 because he is near kinsman unto charles
exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
 where reignier sooner will receive than give
suffolk a dower my lords disgrace not so your king
 that he should be so abject base and poor
 to choose for wealth and not for perfect love
 henry is able to enrich his queen
 and not seek a queen to make him rich
 so worthless peasants bargain for their wives
 as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse
 marriage is a matter of more worth
 than to be dealt in by attorneyship
 not whom we will but whom his grace affects
 must be companion of his nuptial bed
 and therefore lords since he affects her most
 it most of all these reasons bindeth us
 in our opinions she should be preferr'd
 for what is wedlock forced but a hell
 an age of discord and continual strife
 whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
 and is a pattern of celestial peace
 whom should we match with henry being a king
 but margaret that is daughter to a king
 her peerless feature joined with her birth
 approves her fit for none but for a king
 her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
 more than in women commonly is seen
 will answer our hope in issue of a king
 for henry son unto a conqueror
 is likely to beget more conquerors
 if with a lady of so high resolve
 as is fair margaret he be link'd in love
 then yield my lords and here conclude with me
 that margaret shall be queen and none but she
king henry vi whether it be through force of your report
 my noble lord of suffolk or for that
 my tender youth was never yet attaint
 with any passion of inflaming love
 i cannot tell but this i am assured
 i feel such sharp dissension in my breast
 such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
 as i am sick with working of my thoughts
 take therefore shipping post my lord to france
 agree to any covenants and procure
 that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come
 to cross the seas to england and be crown'd
 king henry's faithful and anointed queen
 for your expenses and sufficient charge
 among the people gather up a tenth
 be gone i say for till you do return
 i rest perplexed with a thousand cares
 and you good uncle banish all offence
 if you do censure me by what you were
 not what you are i know it will excuse
 this sudden execution of my will
 and so conduct me where from company
 i may revolve and ruminate my grief
 exit
gloucester ay grief i fear me both at first and last
 exeunt gloucester and exeter
suffolk thus suffolk hath prevail'd and thus he goes
 as did the youthful paris once to greece
 with hope to find the like event in love
 but prosper better than the trojan did
 margaret shall now be queen and rule the king
 but i will rule both her the king and realm

 warkworth before the castle
 enter rumour painted full of tongues
rumour open your ears for which of you will stop
 the vent of hearing when loud rumour speaks
 i from the orient to the drooping west
 making the wind my posthorse still unfold
 the acts commenced on this ball of earth
 upon my tongues continual slanders ride
 the which in every language i pronounce
 stuffing the ears of men with false reports
 i speak of peace while covert enmity
 under the smile of safety wounds the world
 and who but rumour who but only i
 make fearful musters and prepared defence
 whiles the big year swoln with some other grief
 is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
 and no such matter rumour is a pipe
 blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
 and of so easy and so plain a stop
 that the blunt monster with uncounted heads
 the stilldiscordant wavering multitude
 can play upon it but what need i thus
 my wellknown body to anatomize
 among my household why is rumour here
 i run before king harry's victory
 who in a bloody field by shrewsbury
 hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops
 quenching the flame of bold rebellion
 even with the rebel's blood but what mean i
 to speak so true at first my office is
 to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell
 under the wrath of noble hotspur's sword
 and that the king before the douglas rage
 stoop'd his anointed head as low as death
 this have i rumour'd through the peasant towns
 between that royal field of shrewsbury
 and this wormeaten hold of ragged stone
 where hotspur's father old northumberland
 lies craftysick the posts come tiring on
 and not a man of them brings other news
 than they have learn'd of me from rumour's tongues
 they bring smooth comforts false worse than
 true wrongs

northumberland what news lord bardolph every minute now
 should be the father of some stratagem
 the times are wild contention like a horse
 full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
 and bears down all before him
lord bardolph noble earl
 i bring you certain news from shrewsbury
northumberland good an god will
lord bardolph as good as heart can wish
 the king is almost wounded to the death
 and in the fortune of my lord your son
 prince harry slain outright and both the blunts
 kill'd by the hand of douglas young prince john
 and westmoreland and stafford fled the field
 and harry monmouth's brawn the hulk sir john
 is prisoner to your son o such a day
 so fought so follow'd and so fairly won
 came not till now to dignify the times
 since caesar's fortunes
northumberland how is this derived
 saw you the field came you from shrewsbury
lord bardolph i spake with one my lord that came from thence
 a gentleman well bred and of good name
 that freely render'd me these news for true
northumberland here comes my servant travers whom i sent
 on tuesday last to listen after news
 enter travers
lord bardolph my lord i overrode him on the way
 and he is furnish'd with no certainties
 more than he haply may retail from me
northumberland now travers what good tidings comes with you
travers my lord sir john umfrevile turn'd me back
 with joyful tidings and being better horsed
 outrode me after him came spurring hard
 a gentleman almost forspent with speed
 that stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
 he ask'd the way to chester and of him
 i did demand what news from shrewsbury
 he told me that rebellion had bad luck
 and that young harry percy's spur was cold
 with that he gave his able horse the head
 and bending forward struck his armed heels
 against the panting sides of his poor jade
 up to the rowelhead and starting so
 he seem'd in running to devour the way
 staying no longer question
northumberland ha again
 said he young harry percy's spur was cold
 of hotspur coldspur that rebellion
 had met ill luck
lord bardolph my lord i'll tell you what
 if my young lord your son have not the day
 upon mine honour for a silken point
 i'll give my barony never talk of it
northumberland why should that gentleman that rode by travers
 give then such instances of loss
lord bardolph who he
 he was some hilding fellow that had stolen
 the horse he rode on and upon my life
 spoke at a venture look here comes more news
 enter morton
northumberland yea this man's brow like to a titleleaf
 foretells the nature of a tragic volume
 so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
 hath left a witness'd usurpation
 say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury
morton i ran from shrewsbury my noble lord
 where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
 to fright our party
northumberland how doth my son and brother
 thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
 is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
 even such a man so faint so spiritless
 so dull so dead in look so woebegone
 drew priam's curtain in the dead of night
 and would have told him half his troy was burnt
 but priam found the fire ere he his tongue
 and i my percy's death ere thou report'st it
 this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus
 your brother thus so fought the noble douglas'
 stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
 but in the end to stop my ear indeed
 thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
 ending with brother son and all are dead'
morton douglas is living and your brother yet
 but for my lord your son
northumberland why he is dead
 see what a ready tongue suspicion hath
 he that but fears the thing he would not know
 hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes
 that what he fear'd is chanced yet speak morton
 tell thou an earl his divination lies
 and i will take it as a sweet disgrace
 and make thee rich for doing me such wrong
morton you are too great to be by me gainsaid
 your spirit is too true your fears too certain
northumberland yet for all this say not that percy's dead
 i see a strange confession in thine eye
 thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
 to speak a truth if he be slain say so
 the tongue offends not that reports his death
 and he doth sin that doth belie the dead
 not he which says the dead is not alive
 yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
 hath but a losing office and his tongue
 sounds ever after as a sullen bell
 remember'd tolling a departing friend
lord bardolph i cannot think my lord your son is dead
morton i am sorry i should force you to believe
 that which i would to god i had not seen
 but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
 rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathed
 to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
 the neverdaunted percy to the earth
 from whence with life he never more sprung up
 in few his death whose spirit lent a fire
 even to the dullest peasant in his camp
 being bruited once took fire and heat away
 from the best temper'd courage in his troops
 for from his metal was his party steel'd
 which once in him abated all the rest
 turn'd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
 and as the thing that's heavy in itself
 upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
 so did our men heavy in hotspur's loss
 lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
 that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
 than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
 fly from the field then was the noble worcester
 too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious scot
 the bloody douglas whose welllabouring sword
 had three times slain the appearance of the king
 gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
 of those that turn'd their backs and in his flight
 stumbling in fear was took the sum of all
 is that the king hath won and hath sent out
 a speedy power to encounter you my lord
 under the conduct of young lancaster
 and westmoreland this is the news at full
northumberland for this i shall have time enough to mourn
 in poison there is physic and these news
 having been well that would have made me sick
 being sick have in some measure made me well
 and as the wretch whose feverweaken'd joints
 like strengthless hinges buckle under life
 impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
 out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs
 weaken'd with grief being now enraged with grief
 are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch
 a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
 must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif
 thou art a guard too wanton for the head
 which princes flesh'd with conquest aim to hit
 now bind my brows with iron and approach
 the ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
 to frown upon the enraged northumberland
 let heaven kiss earth now let not nature's hand
 keep the wild flood confined let order die
 and let this world no longer be a stage
 to feed contention in a lingering act
 but let one spirit of the firstborn cain
 reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
 on bloody courses the rude scene may end
 and darkness be the burier of the dead
travers this strained passion doth you wrong my lord
lord bardolph sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
morton the lives of all your loving complices
 lean on your health the which if you give o'er
 to stormy passion must perforce decay
 you cast the event of war my noble lord
 and summ'd the account of chance before you said
 let us make head it was your presurmise
 that in the dole of blows your son might drop
 you knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge
 more likely to fall in than to get o'er
 you were advised his flesh was capable
 of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
 would lift him where most trade of danger ranged
 yet did you say go forth and none of this
 though strongly apprehended could restrain
 the stiffborne action what hath then befallen
 or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
 more than that being which was like to be
lord bardolph we all that are engaged to this loss
 knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
 that if we wrought our life twas ten to one
 and yet we ventured for the gain proposed
 choked the respect of likely peril fear'd
 and since we are o'erset venture again
 come we will all put forth body and goods
morton tis more than time and my most noble lord
 i hear for certain and do speak the truth
 the gentle archbishop of york is up
 with wellappointed powers he is a man
 who with a double surety binds his followers
 my lord your son had only but the corpse
 but shadows and the shows of men to fight
 for that same word rebellion did divide
 the action of their bodies from their souls
 and they did fight with queasiness constrain'd
 as men drink potions that their weapons only
 seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls
 this word rebellion it had froze them up
 as fish are in a pond but now the bishop
 turns insurrection to religion
 supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts
 he's followed both with body and with mind
 and doth enlarge his rising with the blood
 of fair king richard scraped from pomfret stones
 derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
 tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
 gasping for life under great bolingbroke
 and more and less do flock to follow him
northumberland i knew of this before but to speak truth
 this present grief had wiped it from my mind
 go in with me and counsel every man
 the aptest way for safety and revenge
 get posts and letters and make friends with speed
 never so few and never yet more need

falstaff sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water
page he said sir the water itself was a good healthy
 water but for the party that owed it he might
 have more diseases than he knew for
falstaff men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the
 brain of this foolishcompounded clay man is not
 able to invent anything that tends to laughter more
 than i invent or is invented on me i am not only
 witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other
 men i do here walk before thee like a sow that
 hath overwhelmed all her litter but one if the
 prince put thee into my service for any other reason
 than to set me off why then i have no judgment
 thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn
 in my cap than to wait at my heels i was never
 manned with an agate till now but i will inset you
 neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and
 send you back again to your master for a jewel
 the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is
 not yet fledged i will sooner have a beard grow in
 the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
 cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is
 a faceroyal god may finish it when he will tis
 not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at a
 faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence
 out of it and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
 writ man ever since his father was a bachelor he
 may keep his own grace but he's almost out of mine
 i can assure him what said master dombledon about
 the satin for my short cloak and my slops
page he said sir you should procure him better
 assurance than bardolph he would not take his
 band and yours he liked not the security
falstaff let him be damned like the glutton pray god his
 tongue be hotter a whoreson achitophel a rascally
 yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand
 and then stand upon security the whoreson
 smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and
 bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is
 through with them in honest taking up then they
 must stand upon security i had as lief they would
 put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
 security i looked a should have sent me two and
 twenty yards of satin as i am a true knight and he
 sends me security well he may sleep in security
 for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness
 of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he
 see though he have his own lanthorn to light him
 where's bardolph

 wars is there not employment doth not the king
 lack subjects do not the rebels need soldiers
 though it be a shame to be on any side but one it
 is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side
 were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
 how to make it
servant you mistake me sir
falstaff why sir did i say you were an honest man setting
 my knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied
 in my throat if i had said so
servant i pray you sir then set your knighthood and our
 soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you
 you lie in your throat if you say i am any other
 than an honest man
falstaff i give thee leave to tell me so i lay aside that
 which grows to me if thou gettest any leave of me
 hang me if thou takest leave thou wert better be
 hanged you hunt counter hence avaunt
servant sir my lord would speak with you
lord chiefjustice sir john falstaff a word with you
falstaff my good lord god give your lordship good time of
 day i am glad to see your lordship abroad i heard
 say your lordship was sick i hope your lordship
 goes abroad by advice your lordship though not
 clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in
 you some relish of the saltness of time and i must
 humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
 of your health
lord chiefjustice sir john i sent for you before your expedition to
 shrewsbury
falstaff an't please your lordship i hear his majesty is
 returned with some discomfort from wales
lord chiefjustice i talk not of his majesty you would not come when
 i sent for you
falstaff and i hear moreover his highness is fallen into
 this same whoreson apoplexy
lord chiefjustice well god mend him i pray you let me speak with
 you
falstaff this apoplexy is as i take it a kind of lethargy
 an't please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the
 blood a whoreson tingling
lord chiefjustice what tell you me of it be it as it is
falstaff it hath its original from much grief from study and
 perturbation of the brain i have read the cause of
 his effects in galen it is a kind of deafness
lord chiefjustice i think you are fallen into the disease for you
 hear not what i say to you
falstaff very well my lord very well rather an't please
 you it is the disease of not listening the malady
 of not marking that i am troubled withal
lord chiefjustice to punish you by the heels would amend the
 attention of your ears and i care not if i do
 become your physician
falstaff i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient
 your lordship may minister the potion of
 imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how
 should i be your patient to follow your
 prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a
 scruple or indeed a scruple itself
lord chiefjustice i sent for you when there were matters against you
 for your life to come speak with me
falstaff as i was then advised by my learned counsel in the
 laws of this landservice i did not come
lord chiefjustice well the truth is sir john you live in great infamy
falstaff he that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less
lord chiefjustice your means are very slender and your waste is great
falstaff i would it were otherwise i would my means were
 greater and my waist slenderer
lord chiefjustice you have misled the youthful prince
falstaff the young prince hath misled me i am the fellow
 with the great belly and he my dog
lord chiefjustice well i am loath to gall a newhealed wound your
 day's service at shrewsbury hath a little gilded
 over your night's exploit on gad'shill you may
 thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting
 that action
falstaff my lord
lord chiefjustice but since all is well keep it so wake not a
 sleeping wolf
falstaff to wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox
lord chiefjustice what you are as a candle the better part burnt
 out
falstaff a wassail candle my lord all tallow if i did say
 of wax my growth would approve the truth
lord chiefjustice there is not a white hair on your face but should
 have his effect of gravity
falstaff his effect of gravy gravy gravy
lord chiefjustice you follow the young prince up and down like his
 ill angel
falstaff not so my lord your ill angel is light but i hope
 he that looks upon me will take me without weighing
 and yet in some respects i grant i cannot go i
 cannot tell virtue is of so little regard in these
 costermonger times that true valour is turned
 bearherd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath
 his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the
 other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of
 this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry
 you that are old consider not the capacities of us
 that are young you do measure the heat of our
 livers with the bitterness of your galls and we
 that are in the vaward of our youth i must confess
 are wags too
lord chiefjustice do you set down your name in the scroll of youth
 that are written down old with all the characters of
 age have you not a moist eye a dry hand a
 yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an
 increasing belly is not your voice broken your
 wind short your chin double your wit single and
 every part about you blasted with antiquity and
 will you yet call yourself young fie fie fie sir john
falstaff my lord i was born about three of the clock in the
 afternoon with a white head and something a round
 belly for my voice i have lost it with halloing
 and singing of anthems to approve my youth
 further i will not the truth is i am only old in
 judgment and understanding and he that will caper
 with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the
 money and have at him for the box of the ear that
 the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince
 and you took it like a sensible lord i have
 chequed him for it and the young lion repents
 marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk
 and old sack
lord chiefjustice well god send the prince a better companion
falstaff god send the companion a better prince i cannot
 rid my hands of him
lord chiefjustice well the king hath severed you and prince harry i
 hear you are going with lord john of lancaster
 against the archbishop and the earl of
 northumberland
falstaff yea i thank your pretty sweet wit for it but look
 you pray all you that kiss my lady peace at home
 that our armies join not in a hot day for by the
 lord i take but two shirts out with me and i mean
 not to sweat extraordinarily if it be a hot day
 and i brandish any thing but a bottle i would i
 might never spit white again there is not a
 dangerous action can peep out his head but i am
 thrust upon it well i cannot last ever but it
 was alway yet the trick of our english nation if
 they have a good thing to make it too common if
 ye will needs say i am an old man you should give
 me rest i would to god my name were not so
 terrible to the enemy as it is i were better to be
 eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
 nothing with perpetual motion
lord chiefjustice well be honest be honest and god bless your
 expedition
falstaff will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
 furnish me forth
lord chiefjustice not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to
 bear crosses fare you well commend me to my
 cousin westmoreland

 speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
 and first lord marshal what say you to it
mowbray i well allow the occasion of our arms
 but gladly would be better satisfied
 how in our means we should advance ourselves
 to look with forehead bold and big enough
 upon the power and puissance of the king
hastings our present musters grow upon the file
 to five and twenty thousand men of choice
 and our supplies live largely in the hope
 of great northumberland whose bosom burns
 with an incensed fire of injuries
lord bardolph the question then lord hastings standeth thus
 whether our present five and twenty thousand
 may hold up head without northumberland
hastings with him we may
lord bardolph yea marry there's the point
 but if without him we be thought too feeble
 my judgment is we should not step too far
 till we had his assistance by the hand
 for in a theme so bloodyfaced as this
 conjecture expectation and surmise
 of aids incertain should not be admitted
archbishop of york tis very true lord bardolph for indeed
 it was young hotspur's case at shrewsbury
lord bardolph it was my lord who lined himself with hope
 eating the air on promise of supply
 flattering himself in project of a power
 much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
 and so with great imagination
 proper to madmen led his powers to death
 and winking leap'd into destruction
hastings but by your leave it never yet did hurt
 to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
lord bardolph yes if this present quality of war
 indeed the instant action a cause on foot
 lives so in hope as in an early spring
 we see the appearing buds which to prove fruit
 hope gives not so much warrant as despair
 that frosts will bite them when we mean to build
 we first survey the plot then draw the model
 and when we see the figure of the house
 then must we rate the cost of the erection
 which if we find outweighs ability
 what do we then but draw anew the model
 in fewer offices or at last desist
 to build at all much more in this great work
 which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
 and set another up should we survey
 the plot of situation and the model
 consent upon a sure foundation
 question surveyors know our own estate
 how able such a work to undergo
 to weigh against his opposite or else
 we fortify in paper and in figures
 using the names of men instead of men
 like one that draws the model of a house
 beyond his power to build it who half through
 gives o'er and leaves his partcreated cost
 a naked subject to the weeping clouds
 and waste for churlish winter's tyranny
hastings grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
 should be stillborn and that we now possess'd
 the utmost man of expectation
 i think we are a body strong enough
 even as we are to equal with the king
lord bardolph what is the king but five and twenty thousand
hastings to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph
 for his divisions as the times do brawl
 are in three heads one power against the french
 and one against glendower perforce a third
 must take up us so is the unfirm king
 in three divided and his coffers sound
 with hollow poverty and emptiness
archbishop of york that he should draw his several strengths together
 and come against us in full puissance
 need not be dreaded
hastings if he should do so
 he leaves his back unarm'd the french and welsh
 baying him at the heels never fear that
lord bardolph who is it like should lead his forces hither
hastings the duke of lancaster and westmoreland
 against the welsh himself and harry monmouth
 but who is substituted gainst the french
 i have no certain notice
archbishop of york let us on
 and publish the occasion of our arms
 the commonwealth is sick of their own choice
 their overgreedy love hath surfeited
 an habitation giddy and unsure
 hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
 o thou fond many with what loud applause
 didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke
 before he was what thou wouldst have him be
 and being now trimm'd in thine own desires
 thou beastly feeder art so full of him
 that thou provokest thyself to cast him up
 so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
 thy glutton bosom of the royal richard
 and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
 and howl'st to find it what trust is in
 these times
 they that when richard lived would have him die
 are now become enamour'd on his grave
 thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
 when through proud london he came sighing on
 after the admired heels of bolingbroke
 criest now o earth yield us that king again
 and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed
 past and to come seems best things present worst
mowbray shall we go draw our numbers and set on
hastings we are time's subjects and time bids be gone

prince henry before god i am exceeding weary
poins is't come to that i had thought weariness durst not
 have attached one of so high blood
prince henry faith it does me though it discolours the
 complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth
 it not show vilely in me to desire small beer
poins why a prince should not be so loosely studied as
 to remember so weak a composition
prince henry belike then my appetite was not princely got for
 by my troth i do now remember the poor creature
 small beer but indeed these humble
 considerations make me out of love with my
 greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember
 thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to
 take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
 hast viz these and those that were thy
 peachcoloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy
 shirts as one for superfluity and another for
 use but that the tenniscourtkeeper knows better
 than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
 thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done
 a great while because the rest of thy low
 countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland
 and god knows whether those that bawl out the ruins
 of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the
 midwives say the children are not in the fault
 whereupon the world increases and kindreds are
 mightily strengthened
poins how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard
 you should talk so idly tell me how many good
 young princes would do so their fathers being so
 sick as yours at this time is
prince henry shall i tell thee one thing poins
poins yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing
prince henry it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine
poins go to i stand the push of your one thing that you
 will tell

 sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell
 thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a
 better to call my friend i could be sad and sad
 indeed too
poins very hardly upon such a subject
prince henry by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
 book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and
 persistency let the end try the man but i tell
 thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
 sick and keeping such vile company as thou art
 hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
poins the reason
prince henry what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep
poins i would think thee a most princely hypocrite
prince henry it would be every man's thought and thou art a
 blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never
 a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway
 better than thine every man would think me an
 hypocrite indeed and what accites your most
 worshipful thought to think so
poins why because you have been so lewd and so much
 engraffed to falstaff
prince henry and to thee
poins by this light i am well spoke on i can hear it

 me is that i am a second brother and that i am a
 proper fellow of my hands and those two things i
 confess i cannot help by the mass here comes bardolph

scene iii warkworth before the castle
 enter northumberland lady northumberland and lady percy
northumberland i pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
 give even way unto my rough affairs
 put not you on the visage of the times
 and be like them to percy troublesome
lady
northumberland i have given over i will speak no more
 do what you will your wisdom be your guide
northumberland alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
 and but my going nothing can redeem it
lady percy o yet for god's sake go not to these wars
 the time was father that you broke your word
 when you were more endeared to it than now
 when your own percy when my heart's dear harry
 threw many a northward look to see his father
 bring up his powers but he did long in vain
 who then persuaded you to stay at home
 there were two honours lost yours and your son's
 for yours the god of heaven brighten it
 for his it stuck upon him as the sun
 in the grey vault of heaven and by his light
 did all the chivalry of england move
 to do brave acts he was indeed the glass
 wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
 he had no legs that practised not his gait
 and speaking thick which nature made his blemish
 became the accents of the valiant
 for those that could speak low and tardily
 would turn their own perfection to abuse
 to seem like him so that in speech in gait
 in diet in affections of delight
 in military rules humours of blood
 he was the mark and glass copy and book
 that fashion'd others and him o wondrous him
 o miracle of men him did you leave
 second to none unseconded by you
 to look upon the hideous god of war
 in disadvantage to abide a field
 where nothing but the sound of hotspur's name
 did seem defensible so you left him
 never o never do his ghost the wrong
 to hold your honour more precise and nice
 with others than with him let them alone
 the marshal and the archbishop are strong
 had my sweet harry had but half their numbers
 today might i hanging on hotspur's neck
 have talk'd of monmouth's grave
northumberland beshrew your heart
 fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
 with new lamenting ancient oversights
 but i must go and meet with danger there
 or it will seek me in another place
 and find me worse provided
lady
northumberland o fly to scotland
 till that the nobles and the armed commons
 have of their puissance made a little taste
lady percy if they get ground and vantage of the king
 then join you with them like a rib of steel
 to make strength stronger but for all our loves
 first let them try themselves so did your son
 he was so suffer'd so came i a widow
 and never shall have length of life enough
 to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
 that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
 for recordation to my noble husband
northumberland come come go in with me tis with my mind
 as with the tide swell'd up unto his height
 that makes a stillstand running neither way
 fain would i go to meet the archbishop
 but many thousand reasons hold me back
 i will resolve for scotland there am i

act iii
scene i westminster the palace
 enter king henry iv in his nightgown with a page
king henry iv go call the earls of surrey and of warwick
 but ere they come bid them o'erread these letters
 and well consider of them make good speed
 exit page
 how many thousand of my poorest subjects
 are at this hour asleep o sleep o gentle sleep
 nature's soft nurse how have i frighted thee
 that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
 and steep my senses in forgetfulness
 why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
 upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
 and hush'd with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber
 than in the perfumed chambers of the great
 under the canopies of costly state
 and lull'd with sound of sweetest melody
 o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
 in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch
 a watchcase or a common larumbell
 wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
 seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains
 in cradle of the rude imperious surge
 and in the visitation of the winds
 who take the ruffian billows by the top
 curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
 with deafening clamour in the slippery clouds
 that with the hurly death itself awakes
 canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose
 to the wet seaboy in an hour so rude
 and in the calmest and most stillest night
 with all appliances and means to boot
 deny it to a king then happy low lie down
 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
 enter warwick and surrey
warwick many good morrows to your majesty
king henry iv is it good morrow lords
warwick tis one o'clock and past
king henry iv why then good morrow to you all my lords
 have you read o'er the letters that i sent you
warwick we have my liege
king henry iv then you perceive the body of our kingdom
 how foul it is what rank diseases grow
 and with what danger near the heart of it
warwick it is but as a body yet distemper'd
 which to his former strength may be restored
 with good advice and little medicine
 my lord northumberland will soon be cool'd
king henry iv o god that one might read the book of fate
 and see the revolution of the times
 make mountains level and the continent
 weary of solid firmness melt itself
 into the sea and other times to see
 the beachy girdle of the ocean
 too wide for neptune's hips how chances mock
 and changes fill the cup of alteration
 with divers liquors o if this were seen
 the happiest youth viewing his progress through
 what perils past what crosses to ensue
 would shut the book and sit him down and die
 tis not ten years gone
 since richard and northumberland great friends
 did feast together and in two years after
 were they at wars it is but eight years since
 this percy was the man nearest my soul
 who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
 and laid his love and life under my foot
 yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard
 gave him defiance but which of you was by
 you cousin nevil as i may remember
 to warwick
 when richard with his eye brimful of tears
 then cheque'd and rated by northumberland
 did speak these words now proved a prophecy
 northumberland thou ladder by the which
 my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne'
 though then god knows i had no such intent
 but that necessity so bow'd the state
 that i and greatness were compell'd to kiss
 the time shall come thus did he follow it
 the time will come that foul sin gathering head
 shall break into corruption so went on
 foretelling this same time's condition
 and the division of our amity
warwick there is a history in all men's lives
 figuring the nature of the times deceased
 the which observed a man may prophesy
 with a near aim of the main chance of things
 as yet not come to life which in their seeds
 and weak beginnings lie intreasured
 such things become the hatch and brood of time
 and by the necessary form of this
 king richard might create a perfect guess
 that great northumberland then false to him
 would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
 which should not find a ground to root upon
 unless on you
king henry iv are these things then necessities
 then let us meet them like necessities
 and that same word even now cries out on us
 they say the bishop and northumberland
 are fifty thousand strong
warwick it cannot be my lord
 rumour doth double like the voice and echo
 the numbers of the fear'd please it your grace
 to go to bed upon my soul my lord
 the powers that you already have sent forth
 shall bring this prize in very easily
 to comfort you the more i have received
 a certain instance that glendower is dead
 your majesty hath been this fortnight ill
 and these unseason'd hours perforce must add
 unto your sickness
king henry iv i will take your counsel
 and were these inward wars once out of hand
 we would dear lords unto the holy land

 see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how
 subject we old men are to this vice of lying this
 same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
 me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he
 hath done about turnbull street and every third
 word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk's
 tribute i do remember him at clement's inn like a
 man made after supper of a cheeseparing when a'
 was naked he was for all the world like a forked
 radish with a head fantastically carved upon it
 with a knife a was so forlorn that his
 dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a'
 was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a
 monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came
 ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those
 tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
 carmen whistle and swear they were his fancies or
 his goodnights and now is this vice's dagger
 become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a
 gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and
 i'll be sworn a ne'er saw him but once in the
 tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding
 among the marshal's men i saw it and told john a
 gaunt he beat his own name for you might have
 thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the
 case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a
 court and now has he land and beefs well i'll
 be acquainted with him if i return and it shall
 go hard but i will make him a philosopher's two
 stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the
 old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i
 may snap at him let time shape and there an end

act iv
scene i yorkshire gaultree forest
 enter the archbishop of york mowbray lord
 hastings and others
archbishop of york what is this forest call'd
hastings tis gaultree forest an't shall please your grace
archbishop of york here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
 to know the numbers of our enemies
hastings we have sent forth already
archbishop of york tis well done
 my friends and brethren in these great affairs
 i must acquaint you that i have received
 newdated letters from northumberland
 their cold intent tenor and substance thus
 here doth he wish his person with such powers
 as might hold sortance with his quality
 the which he could not levy whereupon
 he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes
 to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
 that your attempts may overlive the hazard
 and fearful melting of their opposite
mowbray thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
 and dash themselves to pieces
 enter a messenger
hastings now what news
messenger west of this forest scarcely off a mile
 in goodly form comes on the enemy
 and by the ground they hide i judge their number
 upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
mowbray the just proportion that we gave them out
 let us sway on and face them in the field
archbishop of york what wellappointed leader fronts us here
 enter westmoreland
mowbray i think it is my lord of westmoreland
westmoreland health and fair greeting from our general
 the prince lord john and duke of lancaster
archbishop of york say on my lord of westmoreland in peace
 what doth concern your coming
westmoreland then my lord
 unto your grace do i in chief address
 the substance of my speech if that rebellion
 came like itself in base and abject routs
 led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
 and countenanced by boys and beggary
 i say if damn'd commotion so appear'd
 in his true native and most proper shape
 you reverend father and these noble lords
 had not been here to dress the ugly form
 of base and bloody insurrection
 with your fair honours you lord archbishop
 whose see is by a civil peace maintained
 whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd
 whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd
 whose white investments figure innocence
 the dove and very blessed spirit of peace
 wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
 out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
 into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war
 turning your books to graves your ink to blood
 your pens to lances and your tongue divine
 to a trumpet and a point of war
archbishop of york wherefore do i this so the question stands
 briefly to this end we are all diseased
 and with our surfeiting and wanton hours
 have brought ourselves into a burning fever
 and we must bleed for it of which disease
 our late king richard being infected died
 but my most noble lord of westmoreland
 i take not on me here as a physician
 nor do i as an enemy to peace
 troop in the throngs of military men
 but rather show awhile like fearful war
 to diet rank minds sick of happiness
 and purge the obstructions which begin to stop
 our very veins of life hear me more plainly
 i have in equal balance justly weigh'd
 what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
 and find our griefs heavier than our offences
 we see which way the stream of time doth run
 and are enforced from our most quiet there
 by the rough torrent of occasion
 and have the summary of all our griefs
 when time shall serve to show in articles
 which long ere this we offer'd to the king
 and might by no suit gain our audience
 when we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs
 we are denied access unto his person
 even by those men that most have done us wrong
 the dangers of the days but newly gone
 whose memory is written on the earth
 with yet appearing blood and the examples
 of every minute's instance present now
 hath put us in these illbeseeming arms
 not to break peace or any branch of it
 but to establish here a peace indeed
 concurring both in name and quality
westmoreland when ever yet was your appeal denied
 wherein have you been galled by the king
 what peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you
 that you should seal this lawless bloody book
 of forged rebellion with a seal divine
 and consecrate commotion's bitter edge
archbishop of york my brother general the commonwealth
 to brother born an household cruelty
 i make my quarrel in particular
westmoreland there is no need of any such redress
 or if there were it not belongs to you
mowbray why not to him in part and to us all
 that feel the bruises of the days before
 and suffer the condition of these times
 to lay a heavy and unequal hand
 upon our honours
westmoreland o my good lord mowbray
 construe the times to their necessities
 and you shall say indeed it is the time
 and not the king that doth you injuries
 yet for your part it not appears to me
 either from the king or in the present time
 that you should have an inch of any ground
 to build a grief on were you not restored
 to all the duke of norfolk's signories
 your noble and right well remember'd father's
mowbray what thing in honour had my father lost
 that need to be revived and breathed in me
 the king that loved him as the state stood then
 was force perforce compell'd to banish him
 and then that harry bolingbroke and he
 being mounted and both roused in their seats
 their neighing coursers daring of the spur
 their armed staves in charge their beavers down
 their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
 and the loud trumpet blowing them together
 then then when there was nothing could have stay'd
 my father from the breast of bolingbroke
 o when the king did throw his warder down
 his own life hung upon the staff he threw
 then threw he down himself and all their lives
 that by indictment and by dint of sword
 have since miscarried under bolingbroke
westmoreland you speak lord mowbray now you know not what
 the earl of hereford was reputed then
 in england the most valiant gentlemen
 who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled
 but if your father had been victor there
 he ne'er had borne it out of coventry
 for all the country in a general voice
 cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
 were set on hereford whom they doted on
 and bless'd and graced indeed more than the king
 but this is mere digression from my purpose
 here come i from our princely general
 to know your griefs to tell you from his grace
 that he will give you audience and wherein
 it shall appear that your demands are just
 you shall enjoy them every thing set off
 that might so much as think you enemies
mowbray but he hath forced us to compel this offer
 and it proceeds from policy not love
westmoreland mowbray you overween to take it so
 this offer comes from mercy not from fear
 for lo within a ken our army lies
 upon mine honour all too confident
 to give admittance to a thought of fear
 our battle is more full of names than yours
 our men more perfect in the use of arms
 our armour all as strong our cause the best
 then reason will our heart should be as good
 say you not then our offer is compell'd
mowbray well by my will we shall admit no parley
westmoreland that argues but the shame of your offence
 a rotten case abides no handling
hastings hath the prince john a full commission
 in very ample virtue of his father
 to hear and absolutely to determine
 of what conditions we shall stand upon
westmoreland that is intended in the general's name
 i muse you make so slight a question
archbishop of york then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule
 for this contains our general grievances
 each several article herein redress'd
 all members of our cause both here and hence
 that are insinew'd to this action
 acquitted by a true substantial form
 and present execution of our wills
 to us and to our purposes confined
 we come within our awful banks again
 and knit our powers to the arm of peace
westmoreland this will i show the general please you lords
 in sight of both our battles we may meet
 and either end in peace which god so frame
 or to the place of difference call the swords
 which must decide it
archbishop of york my lord we will do so
 exit westmoreland
mowbray there is a thing within my bosom tells me
 that no conditions of our peace can stand
hastings fear you not that if we can make our peace
 upon such large terms and so absolute
 as our conditions shall consist upon
 our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
mowbray yea but our valuation shall be such
 that every slight and falsederived cause
 yea every idle nice and wanton reason
 shall to the king taste of this action
 that were our royal faiths martyrs in love
 we shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
 that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
 and good from bad find no partition
archbishop of york no no my lord note this the king is weary
 of dainty and such picking grievances
 for he hath found to end one doubt by death
 revives two greater in the heirs of life
 and therefore will he wipe his tables clean
 and keep no telltale to his memory
 that may repeat and history his loss
 to new remembrance for full well he knows
 he cannot so precisely weed this land
 as his misdoubts present occasion
 his foes are so enrooted with his friends
 that plucking to unfix an enemy
 he doth unfasten so and shake a friend
 so that this land like an offensive wife
 that hath enraged him on to offer strokes
 as he is striking holds his infant up
 and hangs resolved correction in the arm
 that was uprear'd to execution
hastings besides the king hath wasted all his rods
 on late offenders that he now doth lack
 the very instruments of chastisement
 so that his power like to a fangless lion
 may offer but not hold
archbishop of york tis very true
 and therefore be assured my good lord marshal
 if we do now make our atonement well
 our peace will like a broken limb united
 grow stronger for the breaking
mowbray be it so
 here is return'd my lord of westmoreland
 reenter westmoreland
westmoreland the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship
 to meet his grace just distance tween our armies
mowbray your grace of york in god's name then set forward
archbishop of york before and greet his grace my lord we come

 the other side prince john of lancaster and
 westmoreland officers and others with them
lancaster you are well encounter'd here my cousin mowbray
 good day to you gentle lord archbishop
 and so to you lord hastings and to all
 my lord of york it better show'd with you
 when that your flock assembled by the bell
 encircled you to hear with reverence
 your exposition on the holy text
 than now to see you here an iron man
 cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
 turning the word to sword and life to death
 that man that sits within a monarch's heart
 and ripens in the sunshine of his favour
 would he abuse the countenance of the king
 alack what mischiefs might he set abrooch
 in shadow of such greatness with you lord bishop
 it is even so who hath not heard it spoken
 how deep you were within the books of god
 to us the speaker in his parliament
 to us the imagined voice of god himself
 the very opener and intelligencer
 between the grace the sanctities of heaven
 and our dull workings o who shall believe
 but you misuse the reverence of your place
 employ the countenance and grace of heaven
 as a false favourite doth his prince's name
 in deeds dishonourable you have ta'en up
 under the counterfeited zeal of god
 the subjects of his substitute my father
 and both against the peace of heaven and him
 have here upswarm'd them
archbishop of york good my lord of lancaster
 i am not here against your father's peace
 but as i told my lord of westmoreland
 the time misorder'd doth in common sense
 crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
 to hold our safety up i sent your grace
 the parcels and particulars of our grief
 the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court
 whereon this hydra son of war is born
 whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
 with grant of our most just and right desires
 and true obedience of this madness cured
 stoop tamely to the foot of majesty
mowbray if not we ready are to try our fortunes
 to the last man
hastings and though we here fall down
 we have supplies to second our attempt
 if they miscarry theirs shall second them
 and so success of mischief shall be born
 and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
 whiles england shall have generation
lancaster you are too shallow hastings much too shallow
 to sound the bottom of the aftertimes
westmoreland pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
 how far forth you do like their articles
lancaster i like them all and do allow them well
 and swear here by the honour of my blood
 my father's purposes have been mistook
 and some about him have too lavishly
 wrested his meaning and authority
 my lord these griefs shall be with speed redress'd
 upon my soul they shall if this may please you
 discharge your powers unto their several counties
 as we will ours and here between the armies
 let's drink together friendly and embrace
 that all their eyes may bear those tokens home
 of our restored love and amity
archbishop of york i take your princely word for these redresses
lancaster i give it you and will maintain my word
 and thereupon i drink unto your grace
hastings go captain and deliver to the army
 this news of peace let them have pay and part
 i know it will well please them hie thee captain
 exit officer
archbishop of york to you my noble lord of westmoreland
westmoreland i pledge your grace and if you knew what pains
 i have bestow'd to breed this present peace
 you would drink freely but my love to ye
 shall show itself more openly hereafter
archbishop of york i do not doubt you
westmoreland i am glad of it
 health to my lord and gentle cousin mowbray
mowbray you wish me health in very happy season
 for i am on the sudden something ill
archbishop of york against ill chances men are ever merry
 but heaviness foreruns the good event
westmoreland therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
 serves to say thus some good thing comes
 tomorrow'
archbishop of york believe me i am passing light in spirit
mowbray so much the worse if your own rule be true
 shouts within
lancaster the word of peace is render'd hark how they shout
mowbray this had been cheerful after victory
archbishop of york a peace is of the nature of a conquest
 for then both parties nobly are subdued
 and neither party loser
lancaster go my lord
 and let our army be discharged too
 exit westmoreland
 and good my lord so please you let our trains
 march by us that we may peruse the men
 we should have coped withal
archbishop of york go good lord hastings
 and ere they be dismissed let them march by

hastings my lord our army is dispersed already
 like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses
 east west north south or like a school broke up
 each hurries toward his home and sportingplace
westmoreland good tidings my lord hastings for the which
 i do arrest thee traitor of high treason
 and you lord archbishop and you lord mowbray
 of capitol treason i attach you both
mowbray is this proceeding just and honourable
westmoreland is your assembly so
archbishop of york will you thus break your faith
lancaster i pawn'd thee none
 i promised you redress of these same grievances
 whereof you did complain which by mine honour
 i will perform with a most christian care
 but for you rebels look to taste the due
 meet for rebellion and such acts as yours
 most shallowly did you these arms commence
 fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
 strike up our drums pursue the scatter'd stray
 god and not we hath safely fought today
 some guard these traitors to the block of death
 treason's true bed and yielder up of breath

 of valour do you think me a swallow an arrow or a
 bullet have i in my poor and old motion the
 expedition of thought i have speeded hither with
 the very extremest inch of possibility i have
 foundered nine score and odd posts and here
 traveltainted as i am have in my pure and
 immaculate valour taken sir john colevile of the
 dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy
 but what of that he saw me and yielded that i
 may justly say with the hooknosed fellow of rome
 i came saw and overcame'
lancaster it was more of his courtesy than your deserving
falstaff i know not here he is and here i yield him and
 i beseech your grace let it be booked with the
 rest of this day's deeds or by the lord i will
 have it in a particular ballad else with mine own
 picture on the top on't colevile kissing my foot

 clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
 moon doth the cinders of the element which show
 like pins heads to her believe not the word of

lancaster is thy name colevile

lancaster a famous rebel art thou colevile
falstaff and a famous true subject took him
colevile i am my lord but as my betters are

falstaff i know not how they sold themselves but thou like
 a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i
 thank thee for thee

 i hear the king my father is sore sick
 our news shall go before us to his majesty

 through gloucestershire and when you come to court
 stand my good lord pray in your good report
lancaster fare you well falstaff i in my condition
 shall better speak of you than you deserve
 exeunt all but falstaff
falstaff i would you had but the wit twere better than
 your dukedom good faith this same young sober
 blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make
 him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine
 there's never none of these demure boys come to any
 proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood
 and making many fishmeals that they fall into a
 kind of male greensickness and then when they
 marry they get wenches they are generally fools
 and cowards which some of us should be too but for
 inflammation a good sherris sack hath a twofold
 operation in it it ascends me into the brain
 dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
 vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive
 quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
 delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the
 voice the tongue which is the birth becomes
 excellent wit the second property of your
 excellent sherris is the warming of the blood
 which before cold and settled left the liver
 white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity
 and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes
 it course from the inwards to the parts extreme
 it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives
 warning to all the rest of this little kingdom
 man to arm and then the vital commoners and
 inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain
 the heart who great and puffed up with this
 retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour
 comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is
 nothing without sack for that sets it awork and
 learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till
 sack commences it and sets it in act and use
 hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for
 the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
 father he hath like lean sterile and bare land
 manured husbanded and tilled with excellent
 endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
 sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if
 i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i
 would teach them should be to forswear thin
 potations and to addict themselves to sack

 to this debate that bleedeth at our doors
 we will our youth lead on to higher fields
 and draw no swords but what are sanctified
 our navy is address'd our power collected
 our substitutes in absence well invested
 and every thing lies level to our wish
 only we want a little personal strength
 and pause us till these rebels now afoot
 come underneath the yoke of government
warwick both which we doubt not but your majesty
 shall soon enjoy
king henry iv humphrey my son of gloucester
 where is the prince your brother
gloucester i think he's gone to hunt my lord at windsor
king henry iv and how accompanied
gloucester i do not know my lord
king henry iv is not his brother thomas of clarence with him
gloucester no my good lord he is in presence here
clarence what would my lord and father
king henry iv nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence
 how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother
 he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas
 thou hast a better place in his affection
 than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
 and noble offices thou mayst effect
 of mediation after i am dead
 between his greatness and thy other brethren
 therefore omit him not blunt not his love
 nor lose the good advantage of his grace
 by seeming cold or careless of his will
 for he is gracious if he be observed
 he hath a tear for pity and a hand
 open as day for melting charity
 yet notwithstanding being incensed he's flint
 as humorous as winter and as sudden
 as flaws congealed in the spring of day
 his temper therefore must be well observed
 chide him for faults and do it reverently
 when thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth
 but being moody give him line and scope
 till that his passions like a whale on ground
 confound themselves with working learn this thomas
 and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
 a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
 that the united vessel of their blood
 mingled with venom of suggestion
 as force perforce the age will pour it in
 shall never leak though it do work as strong
 as aconitum or rash gunpowder
clarence i shall observe him with all care and love
king henry iv why art thou not at windsor with him thomas
clarence he is not there today he dines in london
king henry iv and how accompanied canst thou tell that
clarence with poins and other his continual followers
king henry iv most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
 and he the noble image of my youth
 is overspread with them therefore my grief
 stretches itself beyond the hour of death
 the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape
 in forms imaginary the unguided days
 and rotten times that you shall look upon
 when i am sleeping with my ancestors
 for when his headstrong riot hath no curb
 when rage and hot blood are his counsellors
 when means and lavish manners meet together
 o with what wings shall his affections fly
 towards fronting peril and opposed decay
warwick my gracious lord you look beyond him quite
 the prince but studies his companions
 like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
 tis needful that the most immodest word
 be look'd upon and learn'd which once attain'd
 your highness knows comes to no further use
 but to be known and hated so like gross terms
 the prince will in the perfectness of time
 cast off his followers and their memory
 shall as a pattern or a measure live
 by which his grace must mete the lives of others
 turning past evils to advantages
king henry iv tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb

 are by the sheriff of yorkshire overthrown
 the manner and true order of the fight
 this packet please it you contains at large
king henry iv and wherefore should these good news make me sick
 will fortune never come with both hands full
 but write her fair words still in foulest letters
 she either gives a stomach and no food
 such are the poor in health or else a feast
 and takes away the stomach such are the rich
 that have abundance and enjoy it not
 i should rejoice now at this happy news
 and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
 o me come near me now i am much ill
gloucester comfort your majesty
clarence o my royal father
westmoreland my sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up
warwick be patient princes you do know these fits
 are with his highness very ordinary
 stand from him give him air he'll straight be well
clarence no no he cannot long hold out these pangs
 the incessant care and labour of his mind
 hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
 so thin that life looks through and will break out
gloucester the people fear me for they do observe
 unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature
 the seasons change their manners as the year
 had found some months asleep and leap'd them over
clarence the river hath thrice flow'd no ebb between

clarence let us withdraw into the other room
warwick will't please your grace to go along with us
prince henry no i will sit and watch here by the king

 why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
 being so troublesome a bedfellow
 o polish'd perturbation golden care
 that keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
 to many a watchful night sleep with it now
 yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
 as he whose brow with homely biggen bound
 snores out the watch of night o majesty
 when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
 like a rich armour worn in heat of day
 that scalds with safety by his gates of breath
 there lies a downy feather which stirs not
 did he suspire that light and weightless down
 perforce must move my gracious lord my father
 this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
 that from this golden rigol hath divorced
 so many english kings thy due from me
 is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
 which nature love and filial tenderness
 shall o dear father pay thee plenteously
 my due from thee is this imperial crown
 which as immediate as thy place and blood
 derives itself to me lo here it sits
 which god shall guard and put the world's whole strength
 into one giant arm it shall not force
 this lineal honour from me this from thee
 will i to mine leave as tis left to me

 this part of his conjoins with my disease
 and helps to end me see sons what things you are
 how quickly nature falls into revolt
 when gold becomes her object
 for this the foolish overcareful fathers
 have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care
 their bones with industry
 for this they have engrossed and piled up
 the canker'd heaps of strangeachieved gold
 for this they have been thoughtful to invest
 their sons with arts and martial exercises
 when like the bee culling from every flower
 the virtuous sweets
 our thighs pack'd with wax our mouths with honey
 we bring it to the hive and like the bees
 are murdered for our pains this bitter taste
 yield his engrossments to the ending father

 would by beholding him have wash'd his knife
 with gentle eyedrops he is coming hither

 reenter prince henry
 lo where he comes come hither to me harry
 depart the chamber leave us here alone

prince henry i never thought to hear you speak again
king henry iv thy wish was father harry to that thought
 i stay too long by thee i weary thee
 dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
 that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
 before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth
 thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee
 stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
 is held from falling with so weak a wind
 that it will quickly drop my day is dim
 thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
 were thine without offence and at my death
 thou hast seal'd up my expectation
 thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not
 and thou wilt have me die assured of it
 thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
 which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
 to stab at half an hour of my life
 what canst thou not forbear me half an hour
 then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
 and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
 that thou art crowned not that i am dead
 let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
 be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
 only compound me with forgotten dust
 give that which gave thee life unto the worms
 pluck down my officers break my decrees
 for now a time is come to mock at form
 harry the fifth is crown'd up vanity
 down royal state all you sage counsellors hence
 and to the english court assemble now
 from every region apes of idleness
 now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
 have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
 revel the night rob murder and commit
 the oldest sins the newest kind of ways
 be happy he will trouble you no more
 england shall double gild his treble guilt
 england shall give him office honour might
 for the fifth harry from curb'd licence plucks
 the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
 shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
 o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
 when that my care could not withhold thy riots
 what wilt thou do when riot is thy care
 o thou wilt be a wilderness again
 peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
prince henry o pardon me my liege but for my tears
 the moist impediments unto my speech
 i had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
 ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard
 the course of it so far there is your crown
 and he that wears the crown immortally
 long guard it yours if i affect it more
 than as your honour and as your renown
 let me no more from this obedience rise
 which my most inward true and duteous spirit
 teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
 god witness with me when i here came in
 and found no course of breath within your majesty
 how cold it struck my heart if i do feign
 o let me in my present wildness die
 and never live to show the incredulous world
 the noble change that i have purposed
 coming to look on you thinking you dead
 and dead almost my liege to think you were
 i spake unto this crown as having sense
 and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending
 hath fed upon the body of my father
 therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
 other less fine in carat is more precious
 preserving life in medicine potable
 but thou most fine most honour'd most renown'd
 hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege
 accusing it i put it on my head
 to try with it as with an enemy
 that had before my face murder'd my father
 the quarrel of a true inheritor
 but if it did infect my blood with joy
 or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
 if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
 did with the least affection of a welcome
 give entertainment to the might of it
 let god for ever keep it from my head
 and make me as the poorest vassal is
 that doth with awe and terror kneel to it
king henry iv o my son
 god put it in thy mind to take it hence
 that thou mightst win the more thy father's love
 pleading so wisely in excuse of it
 come hither harry sit thou by my bed
 and hear i think the very latest counsel
 that ever i shall breathe god knows my son
 by what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways
 i met this crown and i myself know well
 how troublesome it sat upon my head
 to thee it shall descend with bitter quiet
 better opinion better confirmation
 for all the soil of the achievement goes
 with me into the earth it seem'd in me
 but as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand
 and i had many living to upbraid
 my gain of it by their assistances
 which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
 wounding supposed peace all these bold fears
 thou see'st with peril i have answered
 for all my reign hath been but as a scene
 acting that argument and now my death
 changes the mode for what in me was purchased
 falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
 so thou the garland wear'st successively
 yet though thou stand'st more sure than i could do
 thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
 and all my friends which thou must make thy friends
 have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out
 by whose fell working i was first advanced
 and by whose power i well might lodge a fear
 to be again displaced which to avoid
 i cut them off and had a purpose now
 to lead out many to the holy land
 lest rest and lying still might make them look
 too near unto my state therefore my harry
 be it thy course to busy giddy minds
 with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
 may waste the memory of the former days
 more would i but my lungs are wasted so
 that strength of speech is utterly denied me
 how i came by the crown o god forgive
 and grant it may with thee in true peace live
prince henry my gracious liege
 you won it wore it kept it gave it me
 then plain and right must my possession be
 which i with more than with a common pain
 gainst all the world will rightfully maintain
 enter lord john of lancaster
king henry iv look look here comes my john of lancaster
lancaster health peace and happiness to my royal father
king henry iv thou bring'st me happiness and peace son john
 but health alack with youthful wings is flown
 from this bare wither'd trunk upon thy sight

 where is my lord of warwick
prince henry my lord of warwick
 enter warwick and others
king henry iv doth any name particular belong
 unto the lodging where i first did swoon
warwick tis call'd jerusalem my noble lord
king henry iv laud be to god even there my life must end
 it hath been prophesied to me many years
 i should not die but in jerusalem
 which vainly i supposed the holy land
 but bear me to that chamber there i'll lie
 in that jerusalem shall harry die

davy here sir
shallow davy davy davy davy let me see davy let me
 see davy let me see yea marry william cook
 bid him come hither sir john you shall not be excused
davy marry sir thus those precepts cannot be served
 and again sir shall we sow the headland with wheat
shallow with red wheat davy but for william cook are
 there no young pigeons
davy yes sir here is now the smith's note for shoeing
 and ploughirons
shallow let it be cast and paid sir john you shall not be excused
davy now sir a new link to the bucket must need be
 had and sir do you mean to stop any of william's
 wages about the sack he lost the other day at
 hinckley fair
shallow a shall answer it some pigeons davy a couple
 of shortlegged hens a joint of mutton and any
 pretty little tiny kickshaws tell william cook
davy doth the man of war stay all night sir
shallow yea davy i will use him well a friend i the
 court is better than a penny in purse use his men
 well davy for they are arrant knaves and will backbite
davy no worse than they are backbitten sir for they
 have marvellous foul linen
shallow well conceited davy about thy business davy
davy i beseech you sir to countenance william visor of
 woncot against clement perkes of the hill
shallow there is many complaints davy against that visor
 that visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge
davy i grant your worship that he is a knave sir but
 yet god forbid sir but a knave should have some
 countenance at his friend's request an honest
 man sir is able to speak for himself when a knave
 is not i have served your worship truly sir
 this eight years and if i cannot once or twice in
 a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man i
 have but a very little credit with your worship the
 knave is mine honest friend sir therefore i
 beseech your worship let him be countenanced
shallow go to i say he shall have no wrong look about davy
 exit davy
 where are you sir john come come come off
 with your boots give me your hand master bardolph
bardolph i am glad to see your worship
shallow i thank thee with all my heart kind
 master bardolph and welcome my tall fellow

falstaff i'll follow you good master robert shallow
 exit shallow
 bardolph look to our horses
 exeunt bardolph and page
 if i were sawed into quantities i should make four
 dozen of such bearded hermits staves as master
 shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the
 semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his
 they by observing of him do bear themselves like
 foolish justices he by conversing with them is
 turned into a justicelike servingman their
 spirits are so married in conjunction with the
 participation of society that they flock together in
 consent like so many wildgeese if i had a suit
 to master shallow i would humour his men with the
 imputation of being near their master if to his
 men i would curry with master shallow that no man
 could better command his servants it is certain
 that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
 caught as men take diseases one of another
 therefore let men take heed of their company i
 will devise matter enough out of this shallow to
 keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing
 out of six fashions which is four terms or two
 actions and a shall laugh without intervallums o
 it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
 with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
 had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him
 laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up
shallow within sir john

warwick how now my lord chiefjustice whither away
lord chiefjustice how doth the king
warwick exceeding well his cares are now all ended
lord chiefjustice i hope not dead
warwick he's walk'd the way of nature
 and to our purposes he lives no more
lord chiefjustice i would his majesty had call'd me with him
 the service that i truly did his life
 hath left me open to all injuries
warwick indeed i think the young king loves you not
lord chiefjustice i know he doth not and do arm myself
 to welcome the condition of the time
 which cannot look more hideously upon me
 than i have drawn it in my fantasy
 enter lancaster clarence gloucester
 westmoreland and others
warwick here come the heavy issue of dead harry
 o that the living harry had the temper
 of him the worst of these three gentlemen
 how many nobles then should hold their places
 that must strike sail to spirits of vile sort
lord chiefjustice o god i fear all will be overturn'd
lancaster good morrow cousin warwick good morrow
gloucester 
 good morrow cousin
clarence 
lancaster we meet like men that had forgot to speak
warwick we do remember but our argument
 is all too heavy to admit much talk
lancaster well peace be with him that hath made us heavy
lord chiefjustice peace be with us lest we be heavier
gloucester o good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
 and i dare swear you borrow not that face
 of seeming sorrow it is sure your own
lancaster though no man be assured what grace to find
 you stand in coldest expectation
 i am the sorrier would twere otherwise
clarence well you must now speak sir john falstaff fair
 which swims against your stream of quality
lord chiefjustice sweet princes what i did i did in honour
 led by the impartial conduct of my soul
 and never shall you see that i will beg
 a ragged and forestall'd remission
 if truth and upright innocency fail me
 i'll to the king my master that is dead
 and tell him who hath sent me after him
warwick here comes the prince
 enter king henry v attended
lord chiefjustice good morrow and god save your majesty
king henry v this new and gorgeous garment majesty
 sits not so easy on me as you think
 brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
 this is the english not the turkish court
 not amurath an amurath succeeds
 but harry harry yet be sad good brothers
 for by my faith it very well becomes you
 sorrow so royally in you appears
 that i will deeply put the fashion on
 and wear it in my heart why then be sad
 but entertain no more of it good brothers
 than a joint burden laid upon us all
 for me by heaven i bid you be assured
 i'll be your father and your brother too
 let me but bear your love i ll bear your cares
 yet weep that harry's dead and so will i
 but harry lives that shall convert those tears
 by number into hours of happiness
princes we hope no other from your majesty
king henry v you all look strangely on me and you most
 you are i think assured i love you not
lord chiefjustice i am assured if i be measured rightly
 your majesty hath no just cause to hate me
king henry v no
 how might a prince of my great hopes forget
 so great indignities you laid upon me
 what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
 the immediate heir of england was this easy
 may this be wash'd in lethe and forgotten
lord chiefjustice i then did use the person of your father
 the image of his power lay then in me
 and in the administration of his law
 whiles i was busy for the commonwealth
 your highness pleased to forget my place
 the majesty and power of law and justice
 the image of the king whom i presented
 and struck me in my very seat of judgment
 whereon as an offender to your father
 i gave bold way to my authority
 and did commit you if the deed were ill
 be you contented wearing now the garland
 to have a son set your decrees at nought
 to pluck down justice from your awful bench
 to trip the course of law and blunt the sword
 that guards the peace and safety of your person
 nay more to spurn at your most royal image
 and mock your workings in a second body
 question your royal thoughts make the case yours
 be now the father and propose a son
 hear your own dignity so much profaned
 see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
 behold yourself so by a son disdain'd
 and then imagine me taking your part
 and in your power soft silencing your son
 after this cold considerance sentence me
 and as you are a king speak in your state
 what i have done that misbecame my place
 my person or my liege's sovereignty
king henry v you are right justice and you weigh this well
 therefore still bear the balance and the sword
 and i do wish your honours may increase
 till you do live to see a son of mine
 offend you and obey you as i did
 so shall i live to speak my father's words
 happy am i that have a man so bold
 that dares do justice on my proper son
 and not less happy having such a son
 that would deliver up his greatness so
 into the hands of justice you did commit me
 for which i do commit into your hand
 the unstained sword that you have used to bear
 with this remembrance that you use the same
 with the like bold just and impartial spirit
 as you have done gainst me there is my hand
 you shall be as a father to my youth
 my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
 and i will stoop and humble my intents
 to your wellpractised wise directions
 and princes all believe me i beseech you
 my father is gone wild into his grave
 for in his tomb lie my affections
 and with his spirit sadly i survive
 to mock the expectation of the world
 to frustrate prophecies and to raze out
 rotten opinion who hath writ me down
 after my seeming the tide of blood in me
 hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now
 now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
 where it shall mingle with the state of floods
 and flow henceforth in formal majesty
 now call we our high court of parliament
 and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
 that the great body of our state may go
 in equal rank with the best govern'd nation
 that war or peace or both at once may be
 as things acquainted and familiar to us
 in which you father shall have foremost hand
 our coronation done we will accite
 as i before remember'd all our state
 and god consigning to my good intents
 no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say
 god shorten harry's happy life one day

 epilogue
 spoken by a dancer
 first my fear then my courtesy last my speech
 my fear is your displeasure my courtesy my duty
 and my speech to beg your pardons if you look
 for a good speech now you undo me for what i have
 to say is of mine own making and what indeed i
 should say will i doubt prove mine own marring
 but to the purpose and so to the venture be it
 known to you as it is very well i was lately here
 in the end of a displeasing play to pray your
 patience for it and to promise you a better i
 meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an
 ill venture it come unluckily home i break and
 you my gentle creditors lose here i promised you
 i would be and here i commit my body to your
 mercies bate me some and i will pay you some and
 as most debtors do promise you infinitely
 if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will
 you command me to use my legs and yet that were but
 light payment to dance out of your debt but a
 good conscience will make any possible satisfaction
 and so would i all the gentlewomen here have
 forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the
 gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which
 was never seen before in such an assembly
 one word more i beseech you if you be not too
 much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will
 continue the story with sir john in it and make
 you merry with fair katharine of france where for
 any thing i know falstaff shall die of a sweat
 unless already a be killed with your hard
 opinions for oldcastle died a martyr and this is
 not the man my tongue is weary when my legs are
 too i will bid you good night and so kneel down
 before you but indeed to pray for the queen

 for thou hast given me in this beauteous face
 a world of earthly blessings to my soul
 if sympathy of love unite our thoughts
queen margaret great king of england and my gracious lord
 the mutual conference that my mind hath had
 by day by night waking and in my dreams
 in courtly company or at my beads
 with you mine alderliefest sovereign
 makes me the bolder to salute my king
 with ruder terms such as my wit affords
 and overjoy of heart doth minister
king henry vi her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
 her words yclad with wisdom's majesty
 makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys
 such is the fulness of my heart's content
 lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love
all kneeling long live queen margaret england's
 happiness
queen margaret we thank you all
 flourish
suffolk my lord protector so it please your grace

 between our sovereign and the french king charles

 suffolk ambassador for henry king of england that
 the said henry shall espouse the lady margaret
 daughter unto reignier king of naples sicilia and
 jerusalem and crown her queen of england ere the
 thirtieth of may next ensuing item that the duchy
 of anjou and the county of maine shall be released
 and delivered to the king her father'
 lets the paper fall
king henry vi uncle how now
gloucester pardon me gracious lord
 some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
 and dimm'd mine eyes that i can read no further
king henry vi uncle of winchester i pray read on
cardinal reads item it is further agreed between them
 that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be
 released and delivered over to the king her father
 and she sent over of the king of england's own
 proper cost and charges without having any dowry'
king henry vi they please us well lord marquess kneel down
 we here create thee the first duke of suffolk
 and gird thee with the sword cousin of york
 we here discharge your grace from being regent
 i the parts of france till term of eighteen months
 be full expired thanks uncle winchester
 gloucester york buckingham somerset
 salisbury and warwick
 we thank you all for the great favour done
 in entertainment to my princely queen
 come let us in and with all speed provide
 to see her coronation be perform'd
 exeunt king henry vi queen margaret and suffolk
gloucester brave peers of england pillars of the state
 to you duke humphrey must unload his grief
 your grief the common grief of all the land
 what did my brother henry spend his youth
 his valour coin and people in the wars
 did he so often lodge in open field
 in winter's cold and summer's parching heat
 to conquer france his true inheritance
 and did my brother bedford toil his wits
 to keep by policy what henry got
 have you yourselves somerset buckingham
 brave york salisbury and victorious warwick
 received deep scars in france and normandy
 or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself
 with all the learned council of the realm
 studied so long sat in the councilhouse
 early and late debating to and fro
 how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe
 and had his highness in his infancy
 crowned in paris in despite of foes
 and shall these labours and these honours die
 shall henry's conquest bedford's vigilance
 your deeds of war and all our counsel die
 o peers of england shameful is this league
 fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
 blotting your names from books of memory
 razing the characters of your renown
 defacing monuments of conquer'd france
 undoing all as all had never been
cardinal nephew what means this passionate discourse
 this peroration with such circumstance
 for france tis ours and we will keep it still
gloucester ay uncle we will keep it if we can
 but now it is impossible we should
 suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast
 hath given the duchy of anjou and maine
 unto the poor king reignier whose large style
 agrees not with the leanness of his purse
salisbury now by the death of him that died for all
 these counties were the keys of normandy
 but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son
warwick for grief that they are past recovery
 for were there hope to conquer them again
 my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
 anjou and maine myself did win them both
 those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
 and are the cities that i got with wounds
 delivered up again with peaceful words
 mort dieu
york for suffolk's duke may he be suffocate
 that dims the honour of this warlike isle
 france should have torn and rent my very heart
 before i would have yielded to this league
 i never read but england's kings have had
 large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
 and our king henry gives away his own
 to match with her that brings no vantages
gloucester a proper jest and never heard before
 that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
 for costs and charges in transporting her
 she should have stayed in france and starved
 in france before
cardinal my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot
 it was the pleasure of my lord the king
gloucester my lord of winchester i know your mind
 tis not my speeches that you do mislike
 but tis my presence that doth trouble ye
 rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
 i see thy fury if i longer stay
 we shall begin our ancient bickerings
 lordings farewell and say when i am gone
 i prophesied france will be lost ere long
 exit
cardinal so there goes our protector in a rage
 tis known to you he is mine enemy
 nay more an enemy unto you all
 and no great friend i fear me to the king
 consider lords he is the next of blood
 and heir apparent to the english crown
 had henry got an empire by his marriage
 and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
 there's reason he should be displeased at it
 look to it lords let not his smoothing words
 bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
 what though the common people favour him
 calling him humphrey the good duke of
 gloucester'
 clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
 jesu maintain your royal excellence'
 with god preserve the good duke humphrey'
 i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
 he will be found a dangerous protector
buckingham why should he then protect our sovereign
 he being of age to govern of himself
 cousin of somerset join you with me
 and all together with the duke of suffolk
 we'll quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat
cardinal this weighty business will not brook delay
 i'll to the duke of suffolk presently
 exit
somerset cousin of buckingham though humphrey's pride
 and greatness of his place be grief to us
 yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
 his insolence is more intolerable
 than all the princes in the land beside
 if gloucester be displaced he'll be protector
buckingham or thou or i somerset will be protector
 despite duke humphrey or the cardinal
 exeunt buckingham and somerset
salisbury pride went before ambition follows him
 while these do labour for their own preferment
 behoves it us to labour for the realm
 i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester
 did bear him like a noble gentleman
 oft have i seen the haughty cardinal
 more like a soldier than a man o the church
 as stout and proud as he were lord of all
 swear like a ruffian and demean himself
 unlike the ruler of a commonweal
 warwick my son the comfort of my age
 thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
 hath won the greatest favour of the commons
 excepting none but good duke humphrey
 and brother york thy acts in ireland
 in bringing them to civil discipline
 thy late exploits done in the heart of france
 when thou wert regent for our sovereign
 have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people
 join we together for the public good
 in what we can to bridle and suppress
 the pride of suffolk and the cardinal
 with somerset's and buckingham's ambition
 and as we may cherish duke humphrey's deeds
 while they do tend the profit of the land
warwick so god help warwick as he loves the land
 and common profit of his country
york aside and so says york for he hath greatest cause
salisbury then let's make haste away and look unto the main
warwick unto the main o father maine is lost
 that maine which by main force warwick did win
 and would have kept so long as breath did last
 main chance father you meant but i meant maine
 which i will win from france or else be slain
 exeunt warwick and salisbury
york anjou and maine are given to the french
 paris is lost the state of normandy
 stands on a tickle point now they are gone
 suffolk concluded on the articles
 the peers agreed and henry was well pleased
 to change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter
 i cannot blame them all what is't to them
 tis thine they give away and not their own
 pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
 and purchase friends and give to courtezans
 still revelling like lords till all be gone
 while as the silly owner of the goods
 weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
 and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
 while all is shared and all is borne away
 ready to starve and dare not touch his own
 so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue
 while his own lands are bargain'd for and sold
 methinks the realms of england france and ireland
 bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
 as did the fatal brand althaea burn'd
 unto the prince's heart of calydon
 anjou and maine both given unto the french
 cold news for me for i had hope of france
 even as i have of fertile england's soil
 a day will come when york shall claim his own
 and therefore i will take the nevils parts
 and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey
 and when i spy advantage claim the crown
 for that's the golden mark i seek to hit
 nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right
 nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
 nor wear the diadem upon his head
 whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown
 then york be still awhile till time do serve
 watch thou and wake when others be asleep
 to pry into the secrets of the state
 till henry surfeiting in joys of love
 with his new bride and england's dearbought queen
 and humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars
 then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose
 with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed
 and in my standard bear the arms of york
 to grapple with the house of lancaster
 and force perforce i'll make him yield the crown
 whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair england down

scene ii gloucester's house
 enter gloucester and his duchess
duchess why droops my lord like overripen'd corn
 hanging the head at ceres plenteous load
 why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows
 as frowning at the favours of the world
 why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth
 gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
 what seest thou there king henry's diadem
 enchased with all the honours of the world
 if so gaze on and grovel on thy face
 until thy head be circled with the same
 put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
 what is't too short i'll lengthen it with mine
 and having both together heaved it up
 we'll both together lift our heads to heaven
 and never more abase our sight so low
 as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
gloucester o nell sweet nell if thou dost love thy lord
 banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
 and may that thought when i imagine ill
 against my king and nephew virtuous henry
 be my last breathing in this mortal world
 my troublous dream this night doth make me sad
duchess what dream'd my lord tell me and i'll requite it
 with sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream
gloucester methought this staff mine officebadge in court
 was broke in twain by whom i have forgot
 but as i think it was by the cardinal
 and on the pieces of the broken wand
 were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset
 and william de la pole first duke of suffolk
 this was my dream what it doth bode god knows
duchess tut this was nothing but an argument
 that he that breaks a stick of gloucester's grove
 shall lose his head for his presumption
 but list to me my humphrey my sweet duke
 methought i sat in seat of majesty
 in the cathedral church of westminster
 and in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd
 where henry and dame margaret kneel'd to me
 and on my head did set the diadem
gloucester nay eleanor then must i chide outright
 presumptuous dame illnurtured eleanor
 art thou not second woman in the realm
 and the protector's wife beloved of him
 hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
 above the reach or compass of thy thought
 and wilt thou still be hammering treachery
 to tumble down thy husband and thyself
 from top of honour to disgrace's feet
 away from me and let me hear no more
duchess what what my lord are you so choleric
 with eleanor for telling but her dream
 next time i'll keep my dreams unto myself
 and not be cheque'd
gloucester nay be not angry i am pleased again
 enter messenger
messenger my lord protector tis his highness pleasure
 you do prepare to ride unto saint alban's
 where as the king and queen do mean to hawk
gloucester i go come nell thou wilt ride with us
duchess yes my good lord i'll follow presently
 exeunt gloucester and messenger
 follow i must i cannot go before
 while gloucester bears this base and humble mind
 were i a man a duke and next of blood
 i would remove these tedious stumblingblocks
 and smooth my way upon their headless necks
 and being a woman i will not be slack
 to play my part in fortune's pageant
 where are you there sir john nay fear not man
 we are alone here's none but thee and i
 enter hume

duchess what say'st thou majesty i am but grace
hume but by the grace of god and hume's advice

duchess what say'st thou man hast thou as yet conferr'd
 with margery jourdain the cunning witch
 with roger bolingbroke the conjurer
 and will they undertake to do me good
hume this they have promised to show your highness
 a spirit raised from depth of underground
 that shall make answer to such questions
 as by your grace shall be propounded him
duchess it is enough i'll think upon the questions
 when from st alban's we do make return
 we'll see these things effected to the full
 here hume take this reward make merry man
 with thy confederates in this weighty cause
 exit
hume hume must make merry with the duchess gold
 marry and shall but how now sir john hume
 seal up your lips and give no words but mum
 the business asketh silent secrecy
 dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
 gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
 yet have i gold flies from another coast
 i dare not say from the rich cardinal
 and from the great and newmade duke of suffolk
 yet i do find it so for to be plain
 they knowing dame eleanor's aspiring humour
 have hired me to undermine the duchess
 and buz these conjurations in her brain
 they say a crafty knave does need no broker'
 yet am i suffolk and the cardinal's broker
 hume if you take not heed you shall go near
 to call them both a pair of crafty knaves
 well so it stands and thus i fear at last
 hume's knavery will be the duchess wreck
 and her attainture will be humphrey's fall
 sort how it will i shall have gold for all

 away base cullions suffolk let them go
all come let's be gone
 exeunt
queen margaret my lord of suffolk say is this the guise
 is this the fashion in the court of england
 is this the government of britain's isle
 and this the royalty of albion's king
 what shall king henry be a pupil still
 under the surly gloucester's governance
 am i a queen in title and in style
 and must be made a subject to a duke
 i tell thee pole when in the city tours
 thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
 and stolest away the ladies hearts of france
 i thought king henry had resembled thee
 in courage courtship and proportion
 but all his mind is bent to holiness
 to number avemaries on his beads
 his champions are the prophets and apostles
 his weapons holy saws of sacred writ
 his study is his tiltyard and his loves
 are brazen images of canonized saints
 i would the college of the cardinals
 would choose him pope and carry him to rome
 and set the triple crown upon his head
 that were a state fit for his holiness
suffolk madam be patient as i was cause
 your highness came to england so will i
 in england work your grace's full content
queen margaret beside the haughty protector have we beaufort
 the imperious churchman somerset buckingham
 and grumbling york and not the least of these
 but can do more in england than the king
suffolk and he of these that can do most of all
 cannot do more in england than the nevils
 salisbury and warwick are no simple peers
queen margaret not all these lords do vex me half so much
 as that proud dame the lord protector's wife
 she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
 more like an empress than duke humphrey's wife
 strangers in court do take her for the queen
 she bears a duke's revenues on her back
 and in her heart she scorns our poverty
 shall i not live to be avenged on her
 contemptuous baseborn callet as she is
 she vaunted mongst her minions t'other day
 the very train of her worst wearing gown
 was better worth than all my father's lands
 till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
suffolk madam myself have limed a bush for her
 and placed a quire of such enticing birds
 that she will light to listen to the lays
 and never mount to trouble you again
 so let her rest and madam list to me
 for i am bold to counsel you in this
 although we fancy not the cardinal
 yet must we join with him and with the lords
 till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace
 as for the duke of york this late complaint
 will make but little for his benefit
 so one by one we'll weed them all at last
 and you yourself shall steer the happy helm

 then let him be denay'd the regentship
somerset if somerset be unworthy of the place
 let york be regent i will yield to him
warwick whether your grace be worthy yea or no
 dispute not that york is the worthier
cardinal ambitious warwick let thy betters speak
warwick the cardinal's not my better in the field
buckingham all in this presence are thy betters warwick
warwick warwick may live to be the best of all
salisbury peace son and show some reason buckingham
 why somerset should be preferred in this
queen margaret because the king forsooth will have it so
gloucester madam the king is old enough himself
 to give his censure these are no women's matters
queen margaret if he be old enough what needs your grace
 to be protector of his excellence
gloucester madam i am protector of the realm
 and at his pleasure will resign my place
suffolk resign it then and leave thine insolence
 since thou wert kingas who is king but thou
 the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck
 the dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas
 and all the peers and nobles of the realm
 have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
cardinal the commons hast thou rack'd the clergy's bags
 are lank and lean with thy extortions
somerset thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
 have cost a mass of public treasury
buckingham thy cruelty in execution
 upon offenders hath exceeded law
 and left thee to the mercy of the law
queen margaret they sale of offices and towns in france
 if they were known as the suspect is great
 would make thee quickly hop without thy head
 exit gloucester queen margaret drops her fan
 give me my fan what minion can ye not
 she gives the duchess a box on the ear
 i cry you mercy madam was it you
duchess was't i yea i it was proud frenchwoman
 could i come near your beauty with my nails
 i'd set my ten commandments in your face
king henry vi sweet aunt be quiet twas against her will
duchess against her will good king look to't in time
 she'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
 though in this place most master wear no breeches
 she shall not strike dame eleanor unrevenged

 she's tickled now her fume needs no spurs
 she'll gallop far enough to her destruction

gloucester now lords my choler being overblown
 with walking once about the quadrangle
 i come to talk of commonwealth affairs
 as for your spiteful false objections
 prove them and i lie open to the law
 but god in mercy so deal with my soul
 as i in duty love my king and country
 but to the matter that we have in hand
 i say my sovereign york is meetest man
 to be your regent in the realm of france
suffolk before we make election give me leave
 to show some reason of no little force
 that york is most unmeet of any man
york i'll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet
 first for i cannot flatter thee in pride
 next if i be appointed for the place
 my lord of somerset will keep me here
 without discharge money or furniture
 till france be won into the dauphin's hands
 last time i danced attendance on his will
 till paris was besieged famish'd and lost
warwick that can i witness and a fouler fact
 did never traitor in the land commit
suffolk peace headstrong warwick
warwick image of pride why should i hold my peace
 enter horner the armourer and his man

suffolk because here is a man accused of treason
 pray god the duke of york excuse himself
york doth any one accuse york for a traitor
king henry vi what mean'st thou suffolk tell me what are these
suffolk please it your majesty this is the man
 that doth accuse his master of high treason
 his words were these that richard duke of york
 was rightful heir unto the english crown
 and that your majesty was a usurper
king henry vi say man were these thy words
horner an't shall please your majesty i never said nor
 thought any such matter god is my witness i am
 falsely accused by the villain
peter by these ten bones my lords he did speak them to
 me in the garret one night as we were scouring my
 lord of york's armour
york base dunghill villain and mechanical
 i'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech
 i do beseech your royal majesty
 let him have all the rigor of the law
horner alas my lord hang me if ever i spake the words
 my accuser is my prentice and when i did correct
 him for his fault the other day he did vow upon his
 knees he would be even with me i have good
 witness of this therefore i beseech your majesty
 do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
 accusation
king henry vi uncle what shall we say to this in law
gloucester this doom my lord if i may judge
 let somerset be regent over the french
 because in york this breeds suspicion
 and let these have a day appointed them
 for single combat in convenient place
 for he hath witness of his servant's malice
 this is the law and this duke humphrey's doom
somerset i humbly thank your royal majesty
horner and i accept the combat willingly
peter alas my lord i cannot fight for god's sake pity
 my case the spite of man prevaileth against me o
 lord have mercy upon me i shall never be able to
 fight a blow o lord my heart

queen margaret believe me lords for flying at the brook
 i saw not better sport these seven years day
 yet by your leave the wind was very high
 and ten to one old joan had not gone out
king henry vi but what a point my lord your falcon made
 and what a pitch she flew above the rest
 to see how god in all his creatures works
 yea man and birds are fain of climbing high
suffolk no marvel an it like your majesty
 my lord protector's hawks do tower so well
 they know their master loves to be aloft
 and bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch
gloucester my lord tis but a base ignoble mind
 that mounts no higher than a bird can soar
cardinal i thought as much he would be above the clouds
gloucester ay my lord cardinal how think you by that
 were it not good your grace could fly to heaven
king henry vi the treasury of everlasting joy
cardinal thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts
 beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart
 pernicious protector dangerous peer
 that smooth'st it so with king and commonweal
gloucester what cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory
 tantaene animis coelestibus irae
 churchmen so hot good uncle hide such malice
 with such holiness can you do it
suffolk no malice sir no more than well becomes
 so good a quarrel and so bad a peer
gloucester as who my lord

 enter buckingham
king henry vi what tidings with our cousin buckingham
buckingham such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
 a sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
 under the countenance and confederacy
 of lady eleanor the protector's wife
 the ringleader and head of all this rout
 have practised dangerously against your state
 dealing with witches and with conjurers
 whom we have apprehended in the fact
 raising up wicked spirits from under ground
 demanding of king henry's life and death
 and other of your highness privycouncil
 as more at large your grace shall understand
cardinal aside to gloucester and so my lord protector
 by this means
 your lady is forthcoming yet at london
 this news i think hath turn'd your weapon's edge
 tis like my lord you will not keep your hour
gloucester ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
 sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers
 and vanquish'd as i am i yield to thee
 or to the meanest groom
king henry vi o god what mischiefs work the wicked ones
 heaping confusion on their own heads thereby
queen margaret gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
 and look thyself be faultless thou wert best
gloucester madam for myself to heaven i do appeal
 how i have loved my king and commonweal
 and for my wife i know not how it stands
 sorry i am to hear what i have heard
 noble she is but if she have forgot
 honour and virtue and conversed with such
 as like to pitch defile nobility
 i banish her my bed and company
 and give her as a prey to law and shame
 that hath dishonour'd gloucester's honest name
king henry vi well for this night we will repose us here
 tomorrow toward london back again
 to look into this business thoroughly
 and call these foul offenders to their answers
 and poise the cause in justice equal scales
 whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails

act ii
scene ii london york's garden
 enter york salisbury and warwick
york now my good lords of salisbury and warwick
 our simple supper ended give me leave
 in this close walk to satisfy myself
 in craving your opinion of my title
 which is infallible to england's crown
salisbury my lord i long to hear it at full
warwick sweet york begin and if thy claim be good
 the nevils are thy subjects to command
york then thus
 edward the third my lords had seven sons
 the first edward the black prince prince of wales
 the second william of hatfield and the third
 lionel duke of clarence next to whom
 was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster
 the fifth was edmund langley duke of york
 the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester
 william of windsor was the seventh and last
 edward the black prince died before his father
 and left behind him richard his only son
 who after edward the third's death reign'd as king
 till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster
 the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt
 crown'd by the name of henry the fourth
 seized on the realm deposed the rightful king
 sent his poor queen to france from whence she came
 and him to pomfret where as all you know
 harmless richard was murder'd traitorously
warwick father the duke hath told the truth
 thus got the house of lancaster the crown
york which now they hold by force and not by right
 for richard the first son's heir being dead
 the issue of the next son should have reign'd
salisbury but william of hatfield died without an heir
york the third son duke of clarence from whose line
 i claimed the crown had issue philippe a daughter
 who married edmund mortimer earl of march
 edmund had issue roger earl of march
 roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor
salisbury this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke
 as i have read laid claim unto the crown
 and but for owen glendower had been king
 who kept him in captivity till he died
 but to the rest
york his eldest sister anne
 my mother being heir unto the crown
 married richard earl of cambridge who was son
 to edmund langley edward the third's fifth son
 by her i claim the kingdom she was heir
 to roger earl of march who was the son
 of edmund mortimer who married philippe
 sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence
 so if the issue of the elder son
 succeed before the younger i am king
warwick what plain proceeding is more plain than this
 henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt
 the fourth son york claims it from the third
 till lionel's issue fails his should not reign
 it fails not yet but flourishes in thee
 and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
 then father salisbury kneel we together
 and in this private plot be we the first
 that shall salute our rightful sovereign
 with honour of his birthright to the crown
both long live our sovereign richard england's king
york we thank you lords but i am not your king
 till i be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
 with heartblood of the house of lancaster
 and that's not suddenly to be perform'd
 but with advice and silent secrecy
 do you as i do in these dangerous days
 wink at the duke of suffolk's insolence
 at beaufort's pride at somerset's ambition
 at buckingham and all the crew of them
 till they have snared the shepherd of the flock
 that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey
 tis that they seek and they in seeking that
 shall find their deaths if york can prophesy
salisbury my lord break we off we know your mind at full
warwick my heart assures me that the earl of warwick
 shall one day make the duke of york a king
york and nevil this i do assure myself
 richard shall live to make the earl of warwick
 the greatest man in england but the king

scene iv a street
 enter gloucester and his servingmen in
 mourning cloaks
gloucester thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud
 and after summer evermore succeeds
 barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold
 so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
 sirs what's o'clock
servants ten my lord
gloucester ten is the hour that was appointed me
 to watch the coming of my punish'd duchess
 uneath may she endure the flinty streets
 to tread them with her tenderfeeling feet
 sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
 the abject people gazing on thy face
 with envious looks laughing at thy shame
 that erst did follow thy proud chariotwheels
 when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
 but soft i think she comes and i'll prepare
 my tearstain'd eyes to see her miseries
 enter the duchess in a white sheet and a taper
 burning in her hand with stanley the sheriff
 and officers
servant so please your grace we'll take her from the sheriff
gloucester no stir not for your lives let her pass by
duchess come you my lord to see my open shame
 now thou dost penance too look how they gaze
 see how the giddy multitude do point
 and nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
 ah gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
 and in thy closet pent up rue my shame
 and ban thine enemies both mine and thine
gloucester be patient gentle nell forget this grief
duchess ah gloucester teach me to forget myself
 for whilst i think i am thy married wife
 and thou a prince protector of this land
 methinks i should not thus be led along
 mail'd up in shame with papers on my back
 and followed with a rabble that rejoice
 to see my tears and hear my deepfet groans
 the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
 and when i start the envious people laugh
 and bid me be advised how i tread
 ah humphrey can i bear this shameful yoke
 trow'st thou that e'er i'll look upon the world
 or count them happy that enjoy the sun
 no dark shall be my light and night my day
 to think upon my pomp shall be my hell
 sometime i'll say i am duke humphrey's wife
 and he a prince and ruler of the land
 yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
 as he stood by whilst i his forlorn duchess
 was made a wonder and a pointingstock
 to every idle rascal follower
 but be thou mild and blush not at my shame
 nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
 hang over thee as sure it shortly will
 for suffolk he that can do all in all
 with her that hateth thee and hates us all
 and york and impious beaufort that false priest
 have all limed bushes to betray thy wings
 and fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee
 but fear not thou until thy foot be snared
 nor never seek prevention of thy foes
gloucester ah nell forbear thou aimest all awry
 i must offend before i be attainted
 and had i twenty times so many foes
 and each of them had twenty times their power
 all these could not procure me any scathe
 so long as i am loyal true and crimeless
 wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
 why yet thy scandal were not wiped away
 but i in danger for the breach of law
 thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell
 i pray thee sort thy heart to patience
 these few days wonder will be quickly worn

act iii
scene i the abbey at bury st edmund's
 sound a sennet enter king henry vi queen
 margaret cardinal suffolk york buckingham
 salisbury and warwick to the parliament
king henry vi i muse my lord of gloucester is not come
 tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
 whate'er occasion keeps him from us now
queen margaret can you not see or will ye not observe
 the strangeness of his alter'd countenance
 with what a majesty he bears himself
 how insolent of late he is become
 how proud how peremptory and unlike himself
 we know the time since he was mild and affable
 and if we did but glance a faroff look
 immediately he was upon his knee
 that all the court admired him for submission
 but meet him now and be it in the morn
 when every one will give the time of day
 he knits his brow and shows an angry eye
 and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
 disdaining duty that to us belongs
 small curs are not regarded when they grin
 but great men tremble when the lion roars
 and humphrey is no little man in england
 first note that he is near you in descent
 and should you fall he as the next will mount
 me seemeth then it is no policy
 respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
 and his advantage following your decease
 that he should come about your royal person
 or be admitted to your highness council
 by flattery hath he won the commons hearts
 and when he please to make commotion
 tis to be fear'd they all will follow him
 now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted
 suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden
 and choke the herbs for want of husbandry
 the reverent care i bear unto my lord
 made me collect these dangers in the duke
 if it be fond call it a woman's fear
 which fear if better reasons can supplant
 i will subscribe and say i wrong'd the duke
 my lord of suffolk buckingham and york
 reprove my allegation if you can
 or else conclude my words effectual
suffolk well hath your highness seen into this duke
 and had i first been put to speak my mind
 i think i should have told your grace's tale
 the duchess by his subornation
 upon my life began her devilish practises
 or if he were not privy to those faults
 yet by reputing of his high descent
 as next the king he was successive heir
 and such high vaunts of his nobility
 did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
 by wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall
 smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
 and in his simple show he harbours treason
 the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
 no no my sovereign gloucester is a man
 unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
cardinal did he not contrary to form of law
 devise strange deaths for small offences done
york and did he not in his protectorship
 levy great sums of money through the realm
 for soldiers pay in france and never sent it
 by means whereof the towns each day revolted
buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
 which time will bring to light in smooth
 duke humphrey
king henry vi my lords at once the care you have of us
 to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
 is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience
 our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
 from meaning treason to our royal person
 as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
 the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
 to dream on evil or to work my downfall
queen margaret ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance
 seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed
 for he's disposed as the hateful raven
 is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him
 for he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf
 who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
 take heed my lord the welfare of us all
 hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
 enter somerset
somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign
king henry vi welcome lord somerset what news from france
somerset that all your interest in those territories
 is utterly bereft you all is lost
king henry vi cold news lord somerset but god's will be done
york aside cold news for me for i had hope of france
 as firmly as i hope for fertile england
 thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
 and caterpillars eat my leaves away
 but i will remedy this gear ere long
 or sell my title for a glorious grave
 enter gloucester
gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king
 pardon my liege that i have stay'd so long
suffolk nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon
 unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
 i do arrest thee of high treason here
gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
 nor change my countenance for this arrest
 a heart unspotted is not easily daunted
 the purest spring is not so free from mud
 as i am clear from treason to my sovereign
 who can accuse me wherein am i guilty
york tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france
 and being protector stayed the soldiers pay
 by means whereof his highness hath lost france
gloucester is it but thought so what are they that think it
 i never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
 nor ever had one penny bribe from france
 so help me god as i have watch'd the night
 ay night by night in studying good for england
 that doit that e'er i wrested from the king
 or any groat i hoarded to my use
 be brought against me at my trialday
 no many a pound of mine own proper store
 because i would not tax the needy commons
 have i disbursed to the garrisons
 and never ask'd for restitution
cardinal it serves you well my lord to say so much
gloucester i say no more than truth so help me god
york in your protectorship you did devise
 strange tortures for offenders never heard of
 that england was defamed by tyranny
gloucester why tis well known that whiles i was
 protector
 pity was all the fault that was in me
 for i should melt at an offender's tears
 and lowly words were ransom for their fault
 unless it were a bloody murderer
 or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers
 i never gave them condign punishment
 murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured
 above the felon or what trespass else
suffolk my lord these faults are easy quickly answered
 but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
 whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
 i do arrest you in his highness name
 and here commit you to my lord cardinal
 to keep until your further time of trial
king henry vi my lord of gloucester tis my special hope
 that you will clear yourself from all suspect
 my conscience tells me you are innocent
gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
 virtue is choked with foul ambition
 and charity chased hence by rancour's hand
 foul subornation is predominant
 and equity exiled your highness land
 i know their complot is to have my life
 and if my death might make this island happy
 and prove the period of their tyranny
 i would expend it with all willingness
 but mine is made the prologue to their play
 for thousands more that yet suspect no peril
 will not conclude their plotted tragedy
 beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
 and suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate
 sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue
 the envious load that lies upon his heart
 and dogged york that reaches at the moon
 whose overweening arm i have pluck'd back
 by false accuse doth level at my life
 and you my sovereign lady with the rest
 causeless have laid disgraces on my head
 and with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
 my liefest liege to be mine enemy
 ay all you have laid your heads together
 myself had notice of your conventicles
 and all to make away my guiltless life
 i shall not want false witness to condemn me
 nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
 the ancient proverb will be well effected
 a staff is quickly found to beat a dog'
cardinal my liege his railing is intolerable
 if those that care to keep your royal person
 from treason's secret knife and traitors rage
 be thus upbraided chid and rated at
 and the offender granted scope of speech
 twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace
suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
 with ignominious words though clerkly couch'd
 as if she had suborned some to swear
 false allegations to o'erthrow his state
queen margaret but i can give the loser leave to chide
gloucester far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed
 beshrew the winners for they play'd me false
 and well such losers may have leave to speak
buckingham he'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
 lord cardinal he is your prisoner
cardinal sirs take away the duke and guard him sure
gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch
 before his legs be firm to bear his body
 thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
 and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
 ah that my fear were false ah that it were
 for good king henry thy decay i fear
 exit guarded
king henry vi my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
 do or undo as if ourself were here
queen margaret what will your highness leave the parliament
king henry vi ay margaret my heart is drown'd with grief
 whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
 my body round engirt with misery
 for what's more miserable than discontent
 ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see
 the map of honour truth and loyalty
 and yet good humphrey is the hour to come
 that e'er i proved thee false or fear'd thy faith
 what louring star now envies thy estate
 that these great lords and margaret our queen
 do seek subversion of thy harmless life
 thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
 and as the butcher takes away the calf
 and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
 bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse
 even so remorseless have they borne him hence
 and as the dam runs lowing up and down
 looking the way her harmless young one went
 and can do nought but wail her darling's loss
 even so myself bewails good gloucester's case
 with sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes
 look after him and cannot do him good
 so mighty are his vowed enemies
 his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan
 say who's a traitor gloucester he is none'
 exeunt all but queen margaret cardinal
 suffolk and york somerset remains apart
queen margaret free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams
 henry my lord is cold in great affairs
 too full of foolish pity and gloucester's show
 beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
 with sorrow snares relenting passengers
 or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank
 with shining chequer'd slough doth sting a child
 that for the beauty thinks it excellent
 believe me lords were none more wise than i
 and yet herein i judge mine own wit good
 this gloucester should be quickly rid the world
 to rid us of the fear we have of him
cardinal that he should die is worthy policy
 but yet we want a colour for his death
 tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law
suffolk but in my mind that were no policy
 the king will labour still to save his life
 the commons haply rise to save his life
 and yet we have but trivial argument
 more than mistrust that shows him worthy death
york so that by this you would not have him die
suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i
york tis york that hath more reason for his death
 but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk
 say as you think and speak it from your souls
 were't not all one an empty eagle were set
 to guard the chicken from a hungry kite
 as place duke humphrey for the king's protector
queen margaret so the poor chicken should be sure of death
suffolk madam tis true and were't not madness then
 to make the fox surveyor of the fold
 who being accused a crafty murderer
 his guilt should be but idly posted over
 because his purpose is not executed
 no let him die in that he is a fox
 by nature proved an enemy to the flock
 before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood
 as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege
 and do not stand on quillets how to slay him
 be it by gins by snares by subtlety
 sleeping or waking tis no matter how
 so he be dead for that is good deceit
 which mates him first that first intends deceit
queen margaret thricenoble suffolk tis resolutely spoke
suffolk not resolute except so much were done
 for things are often spoke and seldom meant
 but that my heart accordeth with my tongue
 seeing the deed is meritorious
 and to preserve my sovereign from his foe
 say but the word and i will be his priest
cardinal but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk
 ere you can take due orders for a priest
 say you consent and censure well the deed
 and i'll provide his executioner
 i tender so the safety of my liege
suffolk here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
queen margaret and so say i
york and i and now we three have spoke it
 it skills not greatly who impugns our doom
 enter a post
post great lords from ireland am i come amain
 to signify that rebels there are up
 and put the englishmen unto the sword
 send succors lords and stop the rage betime
 before the wound do grow uncurable
 for being green there is great hope of help
cardinal a breach that craves a quick expedient stop
 what counsel give you in this weighty cause
york that somerset be sent as regent thither
 tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd
 witness the fortune he hath had in france
somerset if york with all his farfet policy
 had been the regent there instead of me
 he never would have stay'd in france so long
york no not to lose it all as thou hast done
 i rather would have lost my life betimes
 than bring a burthen of dishonour home
 by staying there so long till all were lost
 show me one scar character'd on thy skin
 men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win
queen margaret nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
 if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
 no more good york sweet somerset be still
 thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there
 might happily have proved far worse than his
york what worse than nought nay then a shame take all
somerset and in the number thee that wishest shame
cardinal my lord of york try what your fortune is
 the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms
 and temper clay with blood of englishmen
 to ireland will you lead a band of men
 collected choicely from each county some
 and try your hap against the irishmen
york i will my lord so please his majesty
suffolk why our authority is his consent
 and what we do establish he confirms
 then noble york take thou this task in hand
york i am content provide me soldiers lords
 whiles i take order for mine own affairs
suffolk a charge lord york that i will see perform'd
 but now return we to the false duke humphrey
cardinal no more of him for i will deal with him
 that henceforth he shall trouble us no more
 and so break off the day is almost spent
 lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event
york my lord of suffolk within fourteen days
 at bristol i expect my soldiers
 for there i'll ship them all for ireland
suffolk i'll see it truly done my lord of york
 exeunt all but york
york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts
 and change misdoubt to resolution
 be that thou hopest to be or what thou art
 resign to death it is not worth the enjoying
 let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man
 and find no harbour in a royal heart
 faster than springtime showers comes thought
 on thought
 and not a thought but thinks on dignity
 my brain more busy than the labouring spider
 weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
 well nobles well tis politicly done
 to send me packing with an host of men
 i fear me you but warm the starved snake
 who cherish'd in your breasts will sting
 your hearts
 twas men i lack'd and you will give them me
 i take it kindly and yet be well assured
 you put sharp weapons in a madman's hands
 whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band
 i will stir up in england some black storm
 shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
 and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
 until the golden circuit on my head
 like to the glorious sun's transparent beams
 do calm the fury of this madbred flaw
 and for a minister of my intent
 i have seduced a headstrong kentishman
 john cade of ashford
 to make commotion as full well he can
 under the title of john mortimer
 in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade
 oppose himself against a troop of kerns
 and fought so long till that his thighs with darts
 were almost like a sharpquill'd porpentine
 and in the end being rescued i have seen
 him caper upright like a wild morisco
 shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
 full often like a shaghair'd crafty kern
 hath he conversed with the enemy
 and undiscover'd come to me again
 and given me notice of their villanies
 this devil here shall be my substitute
 for that john mortimer which now is dead
 in face in gait in speech he doth resemble
 by this i shall perceive the commons mind
 how they affect the house and claim of york
 say he be taken rack'd and tortured
 i know no pain they can inflict upon him
 will make him say i moved him to those arms
 say that he thrive as tis great like he will
 why then from ireland come i with my strength
 and reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd
 for humphrey being dead as he shall be
 and henry put apart the next for me

scene ii bury st edmund's a room of state
 enter certain murderers hastily
first murderer run to my lord of suffolk let him know
 we have dispatch'd the duke as he commanded
second murderer o that it were to do what have we done
 didst ever hear a man so penitent
 enter suffolk
first murder here comes my lord
suffolk now sirs have you dispatch'd this thing
first murderer ay my good lord he's dead
suffolk why that's well said go get you to my house
 i will reward you for this venturous deed
 the king and all the peers are here at hand
 have you laid fair the bed is all things well
 according as i gave directions
first murderer tis my good lord
suffolk away be gone
 exeunt murderers
 sound trumpets enter king henry vi queen
 margaret cardinal somerset with attendants
king henry vi go call our uncle to our presence straight
 say we intend to try his grace today
 if he be guilty as tis published
suffolk i'll call him presently my noble lord
 exit
king henry vi lords take your places and i pray you all
 proceed no straiter gainst our uncle gloucester
 than from true evidence of good esteem
 he be approved in practise culpable
queen margaret god forbid any malice should prevail
 that faultless may condemn a nobleman
 pray god he may acquit him of suspicion
king henry vi i thank thee meg these words content me much
 reenter suffolk
 how now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou
 where is our uncle what's the matter suffolk
suffolk dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead
queen margaret marry god forfend
cardinal god's secret judgment i did dream tonight
 the duke was dumb and could not speak a word
 king henry vi swoons
queen margaret how fares my lord help lords the king is dead
somerset rear up his body wring him by the nose
queen margaret run go help help o henry ope thine eyes
suffolk he doth revive again madam be patient
king henry vi o heavenly god
queen margaret how fares my gracious lord
suffolk comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort
king henry vi what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me
 came he right now to sing a raven's note
 whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers
 and thinks he that the chirping of a wren
 by crying comfort from a hollow breast
 can chase away the firstconceived sound
 hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words
 lay not thy hands on me forbear i say
 their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting
 thou baleful messenger out of my sight
 upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
 sits in grim majesty to fright the world
 look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
 yet do not go away come basilisk
 and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
 for in the shade of death i shall find joy
 in life but double death now gloucester's dead
queen margaret why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus
 although the duke was enemy to him
 yet he most christianlike laments his death
 and for myself foe as he was to me
 might liquid tears or heartoffending groans
 or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life
 i would be blind with weeping sick with groans
 look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs
 and all to have the noble duke alive
 what know i how the world may deem of me
 for it is known we were but hollow friends
 it may be judged i made the duke away
 so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded
 and princes courts be fill'd with my reproach
 this get i by his death ay me unhappy
 to be a queen and crown'd with infamy
king henry vi ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man
queen margaret be woe for me more wretched than he is
 what dost thou turn away and hide thy face
 i am no loathsome leper look on me
 what art thou like the adder waxen deaf
 be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
 is all thy comfort shut in gloucester's tomb
 why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy
 erect his statue and worship it
 and make my image but an alehouse sign
 was i for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
 and twice by awkward wind from england's bank
 drove back again unto my native clime
 what boded this but well forewarning wind
 did seem to say seek not a scorpion's nest
 nor set no footing on this unkind shore'
 what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts
 and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves
 and bid them blow towards england's blessed shore
 or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
 yet aeolus would not be a murderer
 but left that hateful office unto thee
 the prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me
 knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
 with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
 the splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
 and would not dash me with their ragged sides
 because thy flinty heart more hard than they
 might in thy palace perish margaret
 as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs
 when from thy shore the tempest beat us back
 i stood upon the hatches in the storm
 and when the dusky sky began to rob
 my earnestgaping sight of thy land's view
 i took a costly jewel from my neck
 a heart it was bound in with diamonds
 and threw it towards thy land the sea received it
 and so i wish'd thy body might my heart
 and even with this i lost fair england's view
 and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
 and call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
 for losing ken of albion's wished coast
 how often have i tempted suffolk's tongue
 the agent of thy foul inconstancy
 to sit and witch me as ascanius did
 when he to madding dido would unfold
 his father's acts commenced in burning troy
 am i not witch'd like her or thou not false like him
 ay me i can no more die margaret
 for henry weeps that thou dost live so long
 noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons
warwick it is reported mighty sovereign
 that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder'd
 by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort's means
 the commons like an angry hive of bees
 that want their leader scatter up and down
 and care not who they sting in his revenge
 myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
 until they hear the order of his death
king henry vi that he is dead good warwick tis too true
 but how he died god knows not henry
 enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
 and comment then upon his sudden death
warwick that shall i do my liege stay salisbury
 with the rude multitude till i return
 exit
king henry vi o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
 my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
 some violent hands were laid on humphrey's life
 if my suspect be false forgive me god
 for judgment only doth belong to thee
 fain would i go to chafe his paly lips
 with twenty thousand kisses and to drain
 upon his face an ocean of salt tears
 to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
 and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
 but all in vain are these mean obsequies
 and to survey his dead and earthly image
 what were it but to make my sorrow greater
 reenter warwick and others bearing
 gloucester's body on a bed
warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body
king henry vi that is to see how deep my grave is made
 for with his soul fled all my worldly solace
 for seeing him i see my life in death
warwick as surely as my soul intends to live
 with that dread king that took our state upon him
 to free us from his father's wrathful curse
 i do believe that violent hands were laid
 upon the life of this thricefamed duke
suffolk a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
 what instance gives lord warwick for his vow
warwick see how the blood is settled in his face
 oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost
 of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
 being all descended to the labouring heart
 who in the conflict that it holds with death
 attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy
 which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
 to blush and beautify the cheek again
 but see his face is black and full of blood
 his eyeballs further out than when he lived
 staring full ghastly like a strangled man
 his hair uprear'd his nostrils stretched with struggling
 his hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd
 and tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued
 look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
 his wellproportion'd beard made rough and rugged
 like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged
 it cannot be but he was murder'd here
 the least of all these signs were probable
suffolk why warwick who should do the duke to death
 myself and beaufort had him in protection
 and we i hope sir are no murderers
warwick but both of you were vow'd duke humphrey's foes
 and you forsooth had the good duke to keep
 tis like you would not feast him like a friend
 and tis well seen he found an enemy
queen margaret then you belike suspect these noblemen
 as guilty of duke humphrey's timeless death
warwick who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
 and sees fast by a butcher with an axe
 but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter
 who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest
 but may imagine how the bird was dead
 although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
 even so suspicious is this tragedy
queen margaret are you the butcher suffolk where's your knife
 is beaufort term'd a kite where are his talons
suffolk i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
 but here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease
 that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
 that slanders me with murder's crimson badge
 say if thou darest proud lord of warwickshire
 that i am faulty in duke humphrey's death
 exeunt cardinal somerset and others
warwick what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him
queen margaret he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
 nor cease to be an arrogant controller
 though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
warwick madam be still with reverence may i say
 for every word you speak in his behalf
 is slander to your royal dignity
suffolk bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor
 if ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
 thy mother took into her blameful bed
 some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock
 was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art
 and never of the nevils noble race
warwick but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
 and i should rob the deathsman of his fee
 quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
 and that my sovereign's presence makes me mild
 i would false murderous coward on thy knee
 make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
 and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
 that thou thyself was born in bastardy
 and after all this fearful homage done
 give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
 pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men
suffolk thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood
 if from this presence thou darest go with me
warwick away even now or i will drag thee hence
 unworthy though thou art i'll cope with thee
 and do some service to duke humphrey's ghost
 exeunt suffolk and warwick
king henry vi what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
 thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just
 and he but naked though lock'd up in steel
 whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
 a noise within
queen margaret what noise is this
 reenter suffolk and warwick with their
 weapons drawn
king henry vi why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
 here in our presence dare you be so bold
 why what tumultuous clamour have we here
suffolk the traitorous warwick with the men of bury
 set all upon me mighty sovereign
salisbury to the commons entering sirs stand apart
 the king shall know your mind
 dread lord the commons send you word by me
 unless lord suffolk straight be done to death
 or banished fair england's territories
 they will by violence tear him from your palace
 and torture him with grievous lingering death
 they say by him the good duke humphrey died
 they say in him they fear your highness death
 and mere instinct of love and loyalty
 free from a stubborn opposite intent
 as being thought to contradict your liking
 makes them thus forward in his banishment
 they say in care of your most royal person
 that if your highness should intend to sleep
 and charge that no man should disturb your rest
 in pain of your dislike or pain of death
 yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
 were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
 that slily glided towards your majesty
 it were but necessary you were waked
 lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber
 the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
 and therefore do they cry though you forbid
 that they will guard you whether you will or no
 from such fell serpents as false suffolk is
 with whose envenomed and fatal sting
 your loving uncle twenty times his worth
 they say is shamefully bereft of life
commons within an answer from the king my
 lord of salisbury
suffolk tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds
 could send such message to their sovereign
 but you my lord were glad to be employ'd
 to show how quaint an orator you are
 but all the honour salisbury hath won
 is that he was the lord ambassador
 sent from a sort of tinkers to the king
commons within an answer from the king or we will all break in
king henry vi go salisbury and tell them all from me
 i thank them for their tender loving care
 and had i not been cited so by them
 yet did i purpose as they do entreat
 for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
 mischance unto my state by suffolk's means
 and therefore by his majesty i swear
 whose far unworthy deputy i am
 he shall not breathe infection in this air
 but three days longer on the pain of death
 exit salisbury
queen margaret o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk
king henry vi ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk
 no more i say if thou dost plead for him
 thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
 had i but said i would have kept my word
 but when i swear it is irrevocable
 if after three days space thou here be'st found
 on any ground that i am ruler of
 the world shall not be ransom for thy life
 come warwick come good warwick go with me
 i have great matters to impart to thee
 exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk
queen margaret mischance and sorrow go along with you
 heart's discontent and sour affliction
 be playfellows to keep you company
 there's two of you the devil make a third
 and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
suffolk cease gentle queen these execrations
 and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave
queen margaret fie coward woman and softhearted wretch
 hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
suffolk a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them
 would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan
 i would invent as bittersearching terms
 as curst as harsh and horrible to hear
 deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth
 with full as many signs of deadly hate
 as leanfaced envy in her loathsome cave
 my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
 mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
 mine hair be fixed on end as one distract
 ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
 and even now my burthen'd heart would break
 should i not curse them poison be their drink
 gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
 their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
 their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks
 their softest touch as smart as lizards sting
 their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
 and boding screechowls make the concert full
 all the foul terrors in darkseated hell
queen margaret enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself
 and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass
 or like an overcharged gun recoil
 and turn the force of them upon thyself
suffolk you bade me ban and will you bid me leave
 now by the ground that i am banish'd from
 well could i curse away a winter's night
 though standing naked on a mountain top
 where biting cold would never let grass grow
 and think it but a minute spent in sport
queen margaret o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand
 that i may dew it with my mournful tears
 nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
 to wash away my woful monuments
 o could this kiss be printed in thy hand
 that thou mightst think upon these by the seal
 through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee
 so get thee gone that i may know my grief
 tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by
 as one that surfeits thinking on a want
 i will repeal thee or be well assured
 adventure to be banished myself
 and banished i am if but from thee
 go speak not to me even now be gone
 o go not yet even thus two friends condemn'd
 embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
 loather a hundred times to part than die
 yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
suffolk thus is poor suffolk ten times banished
 once by the king and three times thrice by thee
 tis not the land i care for wert thou thence
 a wilderness is populous enough
 so suffolk had thy heavenly company
 for where thou art there is the world itself
 with every several pleasure in the world
 and where thou art not desolation
 i can no more live thou to joy thy life
 myself no joy in nought but that thou livest
 enter vaux
queen margaret wither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee
vaux to signify unto his majesty
 that cardinal beaufort is at point of death
 for suddenly a grievous sickness took him
 that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
 blaspheming god and cursing men on earth
 sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey's ghost
 were by his side sometime he calls the king
 and whispers to his pillow as to him
 the secrets of his overcharged soul
 and i am sent to tell his majesty
 that even now he cries aloud for him
queen margaret go tell this heavy message to the king
 exit vaux
 ay me what is this world what news are these
 but wherefore grieve i at an hour's poor loss
 omitting suffolk's exile my soul's treasure
 why only suffolk mourn i not for thee
 and with the southern clouds contend in tears
 theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows
 now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming
 if thou be found by me thou art but dead
suffolk if i depart from thee i cannot live
 and in thy sight to die what were it else
 but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
 here could i breathe my soul into the air
 as mild and gentle as the cradlebabe
 dying with mother's dug between its lips
 where from thy sight i should be raging mad
 and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
 to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
 so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
 or i should breathe it so into thy body
 and then it lived in sweet elysium
 to die by thee were but to die in jest
 from thee to die were torture more than death
 o let me stay befall what may befall
queen margaret away though parting be a fretful corrosive
 it is applied to a deathful wound
 to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee
 for wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe
 i'll have an iris that shall find thee out
suffolk i go
queen margaret and take my heart with thee
suffolk a jewel lock'd into the wofull'st cask
 that ever did contain a thing of worth
 even as a splitted bark so sunder we
 this way fall i to death
queen margaret this way for me

 bring the strong poison that i bought of him
king henry vi o thou eternal mover of the heavens
 look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
 o beat away the busy meddling fiend
 that lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul
 and from his bosom purge this black despair
warwick see how the pangs of death do make him grin
salisbury disturb him not let him pass peaceably
king henry vi peace to his soul if god's good pleasure be
 lord cardinal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss
 hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
 he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him

act iv
scene i the coast of kent
 alarum fight at sea ordnance goes off enter a
 captain a master a master'smate walter whitmore
 and others with them suffolk and others prisoners
captain the gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
 is crept into the bosom of the sea
 and now loudhowling wolves arouse the jades
 that drag the tragic melancholy night
 who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
 clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
 breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
 therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
 for whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs
 here shall they make their ransom on the sand
 or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore
 master this prisoner freely give i thee
 and thou that art his mate make boot of this
 the other walter whitmore is thy share
first gentleman what is my ransom master let me know
master a thousand crowns or else lay down your head
master'smate and so much shall you give or off goes yours
captain what think you much to pay two thousand crowns
 and bear the name and port of gentlemen
 cut both the villains throats for die you shall
 the lives of those which we have lost in fight
 be counterpoised with such a petty sum
first gentleman i'll give it sir and therefore spare my life
second gentleman and so will i and write home for it straight
whitmore i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
 and therefore to revenge it shalt thou die
 to suffolk
 and so should these if i might have my will
captain be not so rash take ransom let him live
suffolk look on my george i am a gentleman
 rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid
whitmore and so am i my name is walter whitmore
 how now why start'st thou what doth
 death affright
suffolk thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
 a cunning man did calculate my birth
 and told me that by water i should die
 yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded
 thy name is gaultier being rightly sounded
whitmore gaultier or walter which it is i care not
 never yet did base dishonour blur our name
 but with our sword we wiped away the blot
 therefore when merchantlike i sell revenge
 broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced
 and i proclaim'd a coward through the world
suffolk stay whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
 the duke of suffolk william de la pole
whitmore the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags
suffolk ay but these rags are no part of the duke
 jove sometimes went disguised and why not i
captain but jove was never slain as thou shalt be
suffolk obscure and lowly swain king henry's blood
 the honourable blood of lancaster
 must not be shed by such a jaded groom
 hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup
 bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule
 and thought thee happy when i shook my head
 how often hast thou waited at my cup
 fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board
 when i have feasted with queen margaret
 remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n
 ay and allay this thy abortive pride
 how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
 and duly waited for my coming forth
 this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
 and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
whitmore speak captain shall i stab the forlorn swain
captain first let my words stab him as he hath me
suffolk base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
captain convey him hence and on our longboat's side
 strike off his head
suffolk thou darest not for thy own

 ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
 troubles the silver spring where england drinks
 now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth
 for swallowing the treasure of the realm
 thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground
 and thou that smiledst at good duke humphrey's death
 against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
 who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
 and wedded be thou to the hags of hell
 for daring to affy a mighty lord
 unto the daughter of a worthless king
 having neither subject wealth nor diadem
 by devilish policy art thou grown great
 and like ambitious sylla overgorged
 with gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart
 by thee anjou and maine were sold to france
 the false revolting normans thorough thee
 disdain to call us lord and picardy
 hath slain their governors surprised our forts
 and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
 the princely warwick and the nevils all
 whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
 as hating thee are rising up in arms
 and now the house of york thrust from the crown
 by shameful murder of a guiltless king
 and lofty proud encroaching tyranny
 burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
 advance our halffaced sun striving to shine
 under the which is writ invitis nubibus'
 the commons here in kent are up in arms
 and to conclude reproach and beggary
 is crept into the palace of our king
 and all by thee away convey him hence
suffolk o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder
 upon these paltry servile abject drudges
 small things make base men proud this villain here
 being captain of a pinnace threatens more
 than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate
 drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives
 it is impossible that i should die
 by such a lowly vassal as thyself
 thy words move rage and not remorse in me
 i go of message from the queen to france
 i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel
captain walter
whitmore come suffolk i must waft thee to thy death
suffolk gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear
whitmore thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee
 what are ye daunted now now will ye stoop
first gentleman my gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
suffolk suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough
 used to command untaught to plead for favour
 far be it we should honour such as these
 with humble suit no rather let my head
 stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
 save to the god of heaven and to my king
 and sooner dance upon a bloody pole
 than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom
 true nobility is exempt from fear
 more can i bear than you dare execute
captain hale him away and let him talk no more
suffolk come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
 that this my death may never be forgot
 great men oft die by vile bezonians
 a roman sworder and banditto slave
 murder'd sweet tully brutus bastard hand
 stabb'd julius caesar savage islanders
 pompey the great and suffolk dies by pirates
 exeunt whitmore and others with suffolk
captain and as for these whose ransom we have set
 it is our pleasure one of them depart
 therefore come you with us and let him go
 exeunt all but the first gentleman
 reenter whitmore with suffolk's body
whitmore there let his head and lifeless body lie
 until the queen his mistress bury it
 exit
first gentleman o barbarous and bloody spectacle
 his body will i bear unto the king
 if he revenge it not yet will his friends
 so will the queen that living held him dear
 exit with the body

 this hot weather and i think this word sallet'
 was born to do me good for many a time but for a

 and hang thee o'er my tomb when i am dead
 ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point
 but thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat
 to emblaze the honour that thy master got
cade iden farewell and be proud of thy victory tell
 kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort
 all the world to be cowards for i that never
 feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour
 dies
iden how much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge
 die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
 and as i thrust thy body in with my sword
 so wish i i might thrust thy soul to hell
 hence will i drag thee headlong by the heels
 unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
 and there cut off thy most ungracious head
 which i will bear in triumph to the king
 leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon

 2 king henry vi
act v
scene i fields between dartford and blackheath
 enter york and his army of irish with drum
 and colours
york from ireland thus comes york to claim his right
 and pluck the crown from feeble henry's head
 ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright
 to entertain great england's lawful king
 ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear
 let them obey that know not how to rule
 this hand was made to handle naught but gold
 i cannot give due action to my words
 except a sword or sceptre balance it
 a sceptre shall it have have i a soul
 on which i'll toss the flowerdeluce of france
 enter buckingham
 whom have we here buckingham to disturb me
 the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble
buckingham york if thou meanest well i greet thee well
york humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting
 art thou a messenger or come of pleasure
buckingham a messenger from henry our dread liege
 to know the reason of these arms in peace
 or why thou being a subject as i am
 against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
 should raise so great a power without his leave
 or dare to bring thy force so near the court
york aside scarce can i speak my choler is so great
 o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint
 i am so angry at these abject terms
 and now like ajax telamonius
 on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury
 i am far better born than is the king
 more like a king more kingly in my thoughts
 but i must make fair weather yet a while
 till henry be more weak and i more strong
 buckingham i prithee pardon me
 that i have given no answer all this while
 my mind was troubled with deep melancholy
 the cause why i have brought this army hither
 is to remove proud somerset from the king
 seditious to his grace and to the state
buckingham that is too much presumption on thy part
 but if thy arms be to no other end
 the king hath yielded unto thy demand
 the duke of somerset is in the tower
york upon thine honour is he prisoner
buckingham upon mine honour he is prisoner
york then buckingham i do dismiss my powers
 soldiers i thank you all disperse yourselves
 meet me tomorrow in st george's field

york how now is somerset at liberty
 then york unloose thy longimprison'd thoughts
 and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
 shall i endure the sight of somerset
 false king why hast thou broken faith with me
 knowing how hardly i can brook abuse
 king did i call thee no thou art not king
 not fit to govern and rule multitudes
 which darest not no nor canst not rule a traitor
 that head of thine doth not become a crown
 thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff
 and not to grace an awful princely sceptre
 that gold must round engirt these brows of mine
 whose smile and frown like to achilles spear
 is able with the change to kill and cure
 here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
 and with the same to act controlling laws
 give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more
 o'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler
somerset o monstrous traitor i arrest thee york
 of capital treason gainst the king and crown
 obey audacious traitor kneel for grace
york wouldst have me kneel first let me ask of these
 if they can brook i bow a knee to man
 sirrah call in my sons to be my bail

clifford health and all happiness to my lord the king
 kneels
york i thank thee clifford say what news with thee
 nay do not fright us with an angry look
 we are thy sovereign clifford kneel again
 for thy mistaking so we pardon thee
clifford this is my king york i do not mistake
 but thou mistakest me much to think i do
 to bedlam with him is the man grown mad
king henry vi ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour
 makes him oppose himself against his king
clifford he is a traitor let him to the tower
 and chop away that factious pate of his
queen margaret he is arrested but will not obey
 his sons he says shall give their words for him
york will you not sons
edward ay noble father if our words will serve
richard and if words will not then our weapons shall
clifford why what a brood of traitors have we here
york look in a glass and call thy image so
 i am thy king and thou a falseheart traitor
 call hither to the stake my two brave bears
 that with the very shaking of their chains
 they may astonish these felllurking curs
 bid salisbury and warwick come to me
 enter the warwick and salisbury
clifford are these thy bears we'll bait thy bears to death
 and manacle the bearward in their chains
 if thou darest bring them to the baiting place
richard oft have i seen a hot o'erweening cur
 run back and bite because he was withheld
 who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw
 hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried
 and such a piece of service will you do
 if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick
clifford hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
 as crooked in thy manners as thy shape
york nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon
clifford take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves
king henry vi why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
 old salisbury shame to thy silver hair
 thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son
 what wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian
 and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
 o where is faith o where is loyalty
 if it be banish'd from the frosty head
 where shall it find a harbour in the earth
 wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
 and shame thine honourable age with blood
 why art thou old and want'st experience
 or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
 for shame in duty bend thy knee to me
 that bows unto the grave with mickle age
salisbury my lord i have consider'd with myself
 the title of this most renowned duke
 and in my conscience do repute his grace
 the rightful heir to england's royal seat
king henry vi hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
salisbury i have
king henry vi canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
salisbury it is great sin to swear unto a sin
 but greater sin to keep a sinful oath
 who can be bound by any solemn vow
 to do a murderous deed to rob a man
 to force a spotless virgin's chastity
 to reave the orphan of his patrimony
 to wring the widow from her custom'd right
 and have no other reason for this wrong
 but that he was bound by a solemn oath
queen margaret a subtle traitor needs no sophister
king henry vi call buckingham and bid him arm himself
york call buckingham and all the friends thou hast
 i am resolved for death or dignity
clifford the first i warrant thee if dreams prove true
warwick you were best to go to bed and dream again
 to keep thee from the tempest of the field
clifford i am resolved to bear a greater storm
 than any thou canst conjure up today
 and that i'll write upon thy burgonet
 might i but know thee by thy household badge
warwick now by my father's badge old nevil's crest
 the rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff
 this day i'll wear aloft my burgonet
 as on a mountain top the cedar shows
 that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
 even to affright thee with the view thereof
clifford and from thy burgonet i'll rend thy bear
 and tread it under foot with all contempt
 despite the bearward that protects the bear
young clifford and so to arms victorious father
 to quell the rebels and their complices
richard fie charity for shame speak not in spite
 for you shall sup with jesu christ tonight
young clifford foul stigmatic that's more than thou canst tell
richard if not in heaven you'll surely sup in hell

 and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night
 they go up
warwick and when the king comes offer no violence

 by words or blows here let us win our right
richard arm'd as we are let's stay within this house
warwick the bloody parliament shall this be call'd
 unless plantagenet duke of york be king
 and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice
 hath made us bywords to our enemies
york then leave me not my lords be resolute
 i mean to take possession of my right

 to aspire unto the crown and reign as king
 earl of northumberland he slew thy father
 and thine lord clifford and you both have vow'd revenge
 on him his sons his favourites and his friends
northumberland if i be not heavens be revenged on me
clifford the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel
westmoreland what shall we suffer this let's pluck him down
 my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it
king henry vi be patient gentle earl of westmoreland
clifford patience is for poltroons such as he
 he durst not sit there had your father lived
 my gracious lord here in the parliament
 let us assail the family of york
northumberland well hast thou spoken cousin be it so
king henry vi ah know you not the city favours them
 and they have troops of soldiers at their beck
exeter but when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly
king henry vi far be the thought of this from henry's heart
 to make a shambles of the parliamenthouse
 cousin of exeter frowns words and threats
 shall be the war that henry means to use
 thou factious duke of york descend my throne
 and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet
 i am thy sovereign
york i am thine
exeter for shame come down he made thee duke of york
york twas my inheritance as the earldom was
exeter thy father was a traitor to the crown
warwick exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
 in following this usurping henry
clifford whom should he follow but his natural king
warwick true clifford and that's richard duke of york
king henry vi and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne
york it must and shall be so content thyself
warwick be duke of lancaster let him be king
westmoreland he is both king and duke of lancaster
 and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain
warwick and warwick shall disprove it you forget
 that we are those which chased you from the field
 and slew your fathers and with colours spread
 march'd through the city to the palace gates
northumberland yes warwick i remember it to my grief
 and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it
westmoreland plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
 thy kinsman and thy friends i'll have more lives
 than drops of blood were in my father's veins
clifford urge it no more lest that instead of words
 i send thee warwick such a messenger
 as shall revenge his death before i stir
warwick poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats
york will you we show our title to the crown
 if not our swords shall plead it in the field
king henry vi what title hast thou traitor to the crown
 thy father was as thou art duke of york
 thy grandfather roger mortimer earl of march
 i am the son of henry the fifth
 who made the dauphin and the french to stoop
 and seized upon their towns and provinces
warwick talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all
king henry vi the lord protector lost it and not i
 when i was crown'd i was but nine months old
richard you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
 father tear the crown from the usurper's head

york twas by rebellion against his king
king henry vi aside i know not what to say my title's weak
 tell me may not a king adopt an heir
york what then
king henry vi an if he may then am i lawful king
 for richard in the view of many lords
 resign'd the crown to henry the fourth
 whose heir my father was and i am his
york he rose against him being his sovereign
 and made him to resign his crown perforce
warwick suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd
 think you twere prejudicial to his crown
exeter no for he could not so resign his crown
 but that the next heir should succeed and reign
king henry vi art thou against us duke of exeter
exeter his is the right and therefore pardon me
york why whisper you my lords and answer not
exeter my conscience tells me he is lawful king
king henry vi aside all will revolt from me and turn to him
northumberland plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st
 think not that henry shall be so deposed
warwick deposed he shall be in despite of all
northumberland thou art deceived tis not thy southern power
 of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent
 which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
 can set the duke up in despite of me
clifford king henry be thy title right or wrong
 lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence
 may that ground gape and swallow me alive
 where i shall kneel to him that slew my father
king henry vi o clifford how thy words revive my heart
york henry of lancaster resign thy crown
 what mutter you or what conspire you lords
warwick do right unto this princely duke of york
 or i will fill the house with armed men
 and over the chair of state where now he sits
 write up his title with usurping blood
 he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
 themselves
king henry vi my lord of warwick hear me but one word
 let me for this my lifetime reign as king
york confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
 and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest

 hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus
 hadst thou but loved him half so well as i
 or felt that pain which i did for him once
 or nourish'd him as i did with my blood
 thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there
 rather than have that savage duke thine heir
 and disinherited thine only son
prince edward father you cannot disinherit me
 if you be king why should not i succeed
king henry vi pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son
 the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me
queen margaret enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced
 i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch
 thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
 and given unto the house of york such head
 as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
 to entail him and his heirs unto the crown
 what is it but to make thy sepulchre
 and creep into it far before thy time
 warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais
 stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas
 the duke is made protector of the realm
 and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
 the trembling lamb environed with wolves
 had i been there which am a silly woman
 the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
 before i would have granted to that act
 but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour
 and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself
 both from thy table henry and thy bed
 until that act of parliament be repeal'd
 whereby my son is disinherited
 the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
 will follow mine if once they see them spread
 and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
 and utter ruin of the house of york
 thus do i leave thee come son let's away
 our army is ready come we'll after them
king henry vi stay gentle margaret and hear me speak
queen margaret thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone

 the loss of those three lords torments my heart

richard brother though i be youngest give me leave
edward no i can better play the orator
montague but i have reasons strong and forcible
 enter york
york why how now sons and brother at a strife
 what is your quarrel how began it first
edward no quarrel but a slight contention
york about what
richard about that which concerns your grace and us
 the crown of england father which is yours
york mine boy not till king henry be dead
richard your right depends not on his life or death
edward now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
 by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe
 it will outrun you father in the end
york i took an oath that he should quietly reign
edward but for a kingdom any oath may be broken
 i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
richard no god forbid your grace should be forsworn
york i shall be if i claim by open war
richard i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak
york thou canst not son it is impossible
richard an oath is of no moment being not took
 before a true and lawful magistrate
 that hath authority over him that swears
 henry had none but did usurp the place
 then seeing twas he that made you to depose
 your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
 therefore to arms and father do but think
 how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
 within whose circuit is elysium
 and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
 why do we finger thus i cannot rest
 until the white rose that i wear be dyed
 even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart
york richard enough i will be king or die
 brother thou shalt to london presently
 and whet on warwick to this enterprise
 thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk
 and tell him privily of our intent
 you edward shall unto my lord cobham
 with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise
 in them i trust for they are soldiers
 witty courteous liberal full of spirit
 while you are thus employ'd what resteth more
 but that i seek occasion how to rise
 and yet the king not privy to my drift
 nor any of the house of lancaster

 but stay what news why comest thou in such post
messenger the queen with all the northern earls and lords
 intend here to besiege you in your castle

york ay with my sword what think'st thou that we fear them
 edward and richard you shall stay with me
 my brother montague shall post to london

edward i hear their drums let's set our men in order
 and issue forth and bid them battle straight

 enter clifford and soldiers
clifford chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life
 as for the brat of this accursed duke
 whose father slew my father he shall die
tutor and i my lord will bear him company
clifford soldiers away with him
tutor ah clifford murder not this innocent child
 lest thou be hated both of god and man
 exit dragged off by soldiers
clifford how now is he dead already or is it fear
 that makes him close his eyes i'll open them
rutland so looks the pentup lion o'er the wretch
 that trembles under his devouring paws
 and so he walks insulting o'er his prey
 and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
 ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword
 and not with such a cruel threatening look
 sweet clifford hear me speak before i die
 i am too mean a subject for thy wrath
 be thou revenged on men and let me live
clifford in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood
 hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter
rutland then let my father's blood open it again
 he is a man and clifford cope with him
clifford had thy brethren here their lives and thine
 were not revenge sufficient for me
 no if i digg'd up thy forefathers graves
 and hung their rotten coffins up in chains
 it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
 the sight of any of the house of york
 is as a fury to torment my soul
 and till i root out their accursed line
 and leave not one alive i live in hell
 therefore
 lifting his hand
rutland o let me pray before i take my death
 to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me
clifford such pity as my rapier's point affords
rutland i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
clifford thy father hath
rutland but twas ere i was born
 thou hast one son for his sake pity me
 lest in revenge thereof sith god is just
 he be as miserably slain as i
 ah let me live in prison all my days
 and when i give occasion of offence
 then let me die for now thou hast no cause
clifford no cause
 thy father slew my father therefore die
 stabs him
rutland di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae

clifford plantagenet i come plantagenet
 and this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
 shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
 congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both

 alarum enter york
york the army of the queen hath got the field
 my uncles both are slain in rescuing me
 and all my followers to the eager foe
 turn back and fly like ships before the wind
 or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves
 my sons god knows what hath bechanced them
 but this i know they have demean'd themselves
 like men born to renown by life or death
 three times did richard make a lane to me
 and thrice cried courage father fight it out'
 and full as oft came edward to my side
 with purple falchion painted to the hilt
 in blood of those that had encounter'd him
 and when the hardiest warriors did retire
 richard cried charge and give no foot of ground'
 and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb
 a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre'
 with this we charged again but out alas
 we bodged again as i have seen a swan
 with bootless labour swim against the tide
 and spend her strength with overmatching waves
 a short alarum within
 ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
 and i am faint and cannot fly their fury
 and were i strong i would not shun their fury
 the sands are number'd that make up my life
 here must i stay and here my life must end
 enter queen margaret clifford northumberland
 prince edward and soldiers
 come bloody clifford rough northumberland
 i dare your quenchless fury to more rage
 i am your butt and i abide your shot
northumberland yield to our mercy proud plantagenet
clifford ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
 with downright payment show'd unto my father
 now phaethon hath tumbled from his car
 and made an evening at the noontide prick
york my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
 a bird that will revenge upon you all
 and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven
 scorning whate'er you can afflict me with
 why come you not what multitudes and fear
clifford so cowards fight when they can fly no further
 so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons
 so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
 breathe out invectives gainst the officers
york o clifford but bethink thee once again
 and in thy thought o'errun my former time
 and if though canst for blushing view this face
 and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
 whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
clifford i will not bandy with thee word for word
 but buckle with thee blows twice two for one
queen margaret hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes
 i would prolong awhile the traitor's life
 wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland
northumberland hold clifford do not honour him so much
 to prick thy finger though to wound his heart
 what valour were it when a cur doth grin
 for one to thrust his hand between his teeth
 when he might spurn him with his foot away
 it is war's prize to take all vantages
 and ten to one is no impeach of valour
 they lay hands on york who struggles
clifford ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
northumberland so doth the cony struggle in the net
york so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty
 so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd
northumberland what would your grace have done unto him now
queen margaret brave warriors clifford and northumberland
 come make him stand upon this molehill here
 that raught at mountains with outstretched arms
 yet parted but the shadow with his hand
 what was it you that would be england's king
 was't you that revell'd in our parliament
 and made a preachment of your high descent
 where are your mess of sons to back you now
 the wanton edward and the lusty george
 and where's that valiant crookback prodigy
 dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
 was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
 or with the rest where is your darling rutland
 look york i stain'd this napkin with the blood
 that valiant clifford with his rapier's point
 made issue from the bosom of the boy
 and if thine eyes can water for his death
 i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
 alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly
 i should lament thy miserable state
 i prithee grieve to make me merry york
 what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
 that not a tear can fall for rutland's death
 why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
 and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus
 stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance
 thou wouldst be fee'd i see to make me sport
 york cannot speak unless he wear a crown
 a crown for york and lords bow low to him
 hold you his hands whilst i do set it on
 putting a paper crown on his head
 ay marry sir now looks he like a king
 ay this is he that took king henry's chair
 and this is he was his adopted heir
 but how is it that great plantagenet
 is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath
 as i bethink me you should not be king
 till our king henry had shook hands with death
 and will you pale your head in henry's glory
 and rob his temples of the diadem
 now in his life against your holy oath
 o tis a fault too too unpardonable
 off with the crown and with the crown his head
 and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
clifford that is my office for my father's sake
queen margaret nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes
york shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france
 whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth
 how illbeseeming is it in thy sex
 to triumph like an amazonian trull
 upon their woes whom fortune captivates
 but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging
 made impudent with use of evil deeds
 i would assay proud queen to make thee blush
 to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived
 were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
 thy father bears the type of king of naples
 of both the sicils and jerusalem
 yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
 hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
 it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
 unless the adage must be verified
 that beggars mounted run their horse to death
 tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
 but god he knows thy share thereof is small
 tis virtue that doth make them most admired
 the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at
 tis government that makes them seem divine
 the want thereof makes thee abominable
 thou art as opposite to every good
 as the antipodes are unto us
 or as the south to the septentrion
 o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide
 how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
 to bid the father wipe his eyes withal
 and yet be seen to bear a woman's face
 women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
 thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
 bids't thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish
 wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will
 for raging wind blows up incessant showers
 and when the rage allays the rain begins
 these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies
 and every drop cries vengeance for his death
 gainst thee fell clifford and thee false
 frenchwoman
northumberland beshrew me but his passion moves me so
 that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears
york that face of his the hungry cannibals
 would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood
 but you are more inhuman more inexorable
 o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania
 see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears
 this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy
 and i with tears do wash the blood away
 keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
 and if thou tell'st the heavy story right
 upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
 yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears
 and say alas it was a piteous deed'
 there take the crown and with the crown my curse
 and in thy need such comfort come to thee
 as now i reap at thy too cruel hand
 hardhearted clifford take me from the world
 my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
northumberland had he been slaughterman to all my kin
 i should not for my life but weep with him
 to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
queen margaret what weepingripe my lord northumberland
 think but upon the wrong he did us all
 and that will quickly dry thy melting tears
clifford here's for my oath here's for my father's death
 stabbing him
queen margaret and here's to right our gentlehearted king
 stabbing him
york open thy gate of mercy gracious god
 my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
 dies

 so york may overlook the town of york

 3 king henry vi
act ii
scene i a plain near mortimer's cross in herefordshire
 a march enter edward richard and their power
edward i wonder how our princely father scaped
 or whether he be scaped away or no
 from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit
 had he been ta'en we should have heard the news
 had he been slain we should have heard the news
 or had he scaped methinks we should have heard
 the happy tidings of his good escape
 how fares my brother why is he so sad
richard i cannot joy until i be resolved
 where our right valiant father is become
 i saw him in the battle range about
 and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth
 methought he bore him in the thickest troop
 as doth a lion in a herd of neat
 or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs
 who having pinch'd a few and made them cry
 the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
 so fared our father with his enemies
 so fled his enemies my warlike father
 methinks tis prize enough to be his son
 see how the morning opes her golden gates
 and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
 how well resembles it the prime of youth
 trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love
edward dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns
richard three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
 not separated with the racking clouds
 but sever'd in a pale clearshining sky
 see see they join embrace and seem to kiss
 as if they vow'd some league inviolable
 now are they but one lamp one light one sun
 in this the heaven figures some event
edward tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
 i think it cites us brother to the field
 that we the sons of brave plantagenet
 each one already blazing by our meeds
 should notwithstanding join our lights together
 and overshine the earth as this the world
 whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear
 upon my target three fairshining suns
richard nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it
 you love the breeder better than the male
 enter a messenger
 but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
 some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
messenger ah one that was a woful lookeron
 when as the noble duke of york was slain
 your princely father and my loving lord
edward o speak no more for i have heard too much
richard say how he died for i will hear it all
messenger environed he was with many foes
 and stood against them as the hope of troy
 against the greeks that would have enter'd troy
 but hercules himself must yield to odds
 and many strokes though with a little axe
 hew down and fell the hardesttimber'd oak
 by many hands your father was subdued
 but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
 of unrelenting clifford and the queen
 who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite
 laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept
 the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
 a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
 of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain
 and after many scorns many foul taunts
 they took his head and on the gates of york
 they set the same and there it doth remain
 the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd
edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon
 now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
 o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain
 the flower of europe for his chivalry
 and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
 for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee
 now my soul's palace is become a prison
 ah would she break from hence that this my body
 might in the ground be closed up in rest
 for never henceforth shall i joy again
 never o never shall i see more joy
richard i cannot weep for all my body's moisture
 scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart
 nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen
 for selfsame wind that i should speak withal
 is kindling coals that fires all my breast
 and burns me up with flames that tears would quench
 to weep is to make less the depth of grief
 tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
 richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death
 or die renowned by attempting it
edward his name that valiant duke hath left with thee
 his dukedom and his chair with me is left
richard nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird
 show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun
 for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
 either that is thine or else thou wert not his
 march enter warwick montague and their army
warwick how now fair lords what fare what news abroad
richard great lord of warwick if we should recount
 our baleful news and at each word's deliverance
 stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
 the words would add more anguish than the wounds
 o valiant lord the duke of york is slain
edward o warwick warwick that plantagenet
 which held three dearly as his soul's redemption
 is by the stern lord clifford done to death
warwick ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears
 and now to add more measure to your woes
 i come to tell you things sith then befall'n
 after the bloody fray at wakefield fought
 where your brave father breathed his latest gasp
 tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
 were brought me of your loss and his depart
 i then in london keeper of the king
 muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends
 and very well appointed as i thought
 march'd toward saint alban's to intercept the queen
 bearing the king in my behalf along
 for by my scouts i was advertised
 that she was coming with a full intent
 to dash our late decree in parliament
 touching king henry's oath and your succession
 short tale to make we at saint alban's met
 our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought
 but whether twas the coldness of the king
 who look'd full gently on his warlike queen
 that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen
 or whether twas report of her success
 or more than common fear of clifford's rigour
 who thunders to his captives blood and death
 i cannot judge but to conclude with truth
 their weapons like to lightning came and went
 our soldiers like the nightowl's lazy flight
 or like an idle thresher with a flail
 fell gently down as if they struck their friends
 i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause
 with promise of high pay and great rewards
 but all in vain they had no heart to fight
 and we in them no hope to win the day
 so that we fled the king unto the queen
 lord george your brother norfolk and myself
 in haste posthaste are come to join with you
 for in the marches here we heard you were
 making another head to fight again
edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick
 and when came george from burgundy to england
warwick some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
 and for your brother he was lately sent
 from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy
 with aid of soldiers to this needful war
richard twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled
 oft have i heard his praises in pursuit
 but ne'er till now his scandal of retire
warwick nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear
 for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
 can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head
 and wring the awful sceptre from his fist
 were he as famous and as bold in war
 as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer
richard i know it well lord warwick blame me not
 tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak
 but in this troublous time what's to be done
 shall we go throw away our coats of steel
 and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
 numbering our avemaries with our beads
 or shall we on the helmets of our foes
 tell our devotion with revengeful arms
 if for the last say ay and to it lords
warwick why therefore warwick came to seek you out
 and therefore comes my brother montague
 attend me lords the proud insulting queen
 with clifford and the haught northumberland
 and of their feather many more proud birds
 have wrought the easymelting king like wax
 he swore consent to your succession
 his oath enrolled in the parliament
 and now to london all the crew are gone
 to frustrate both his oath and what beside
 may make against the house of lancaster
 their power i think is thirty thousand strong
 now if the help of norfolk and myself
 with all the friends that thou brave earl of march
 amongst the loving welshmen canst procure
 will but amount to five and twenty thousand
 why via to london will we march amain
 and once again bestride our foaming steeds
 and once again cry charge upon our foes'
 but never once again turn back and fly
richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak
 ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
 that cries retire if warwick bid him stay
edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean
 and when thou fail'stas god forbid the hour
 must edward fall which peril heaven forfend
warwick no longer earl of march but duke of york
 the next degree is england's royal throne
 for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd
 in every borough as we pass along
 and he that throws not up his cap for joy
 shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
 king edward valiant richard montague
 stay we no longer dreaming of renown
 but sound the trumpets and about our task
richard then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
 as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
 i come to pierce it or to give thee mine
edward then strike up drums god and saint george for us
 enter a messenger
warwick how now what news
messenger the duke of norfolk sends you word by me
 the queen is coming with a puissant host
 and craves your company for speedy counsel
warwick why then it sorts brave warriors let's away

act ii
scene ii before york
 flourish enter king henry vi queen margaret
 prince edward clifford and northumberland with
 drum and trumpets
queen margaret welcome my lord to this brave town of york
 yonder's the head of that archenemy
 that sought to be encompass'd with your crown
 doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
king henry vi ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
 to see this sight it irks my very soul
 withhold revenge dear god tis not my fault
 nor wittingly have i infringed my vow
clifford my gracious liege this too much lenity
 and harmful pity must be laid aside
 to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
 not to the beast that would usurp their den
 whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
 not his that spoils her young before her face
 who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting
 not he that sets his foot upon her back
 the smallest worm will turn being trodden on
 and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
 ambitious york doth level at thy crown
 thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
 he but a duke would have his son a king
 and raise his issue like a loving sire
 thou being a king blest with a goodly son
 didst yield consent to disinherit him
 which argued thee a most unloving father
 unreasonable creatures feed their young
 and though man's face be fearful to their eyes
 yet in protection of their tender ones
 who hath not seen them even with those wings
 which sometime they have used with fearful flight
 make war with him that climb'd unto their nest
 offer their own lives in their young's defence
 for shame my liege make them your precedent
 were it not pity that this goodly boy
 should lose his birthright by his father's fault
 and long hereafter say unto his child
 what my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got
 my careless father fondly gave away'
 ah what a shame were this look on the boy
 and let his manly face which promiseth
 successful fortune steel thy melting heart
 to hold thine own and leave thine own with him
king henry vi full well hath clifford play'd the orator
 inferring arguments of mighty force
 but clifford tell me didst thou never hear
 that things illgot had ever bad success
 and happy always was it for that son
 whose father for his hoarding went to hell
 i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
 and would my father had left me no more
 for all the rest is held at such a rate
 as brings a thousandfold more care to keep
 than in possession and jot of pleasure
 ah cousin york would thy best friends did know
 how it doth grieve me that thy head is here
queen margaret my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
 and this soft courage makes your followers faint
 you promised knighthood to our forward son
 unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
 edward kneel down
king henry vi edward plantagenet arise a knight
 and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
prince my gracious father by your kingly leave
 i'll draw it as apparent to the crown
 and in that quarrel use it to the death
clifford why that is spoken like a toward prince
 enter a messenger
messenger royal commanders be in readiness
 for with a band of thirty thousand men
 comes warwick backing of the duke of york
 and in the towns as they do march along
 proclaims him king and many fly to him
 darraign your battle for they are at hand
clifford i would your highness would depart the field
 the queen hath best success when you are absent
queen margaret ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
king henry vi why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay
northumberland be it with resolution then to fight
prince edward my royal father cheer these noble lords
 and hearten those that fight in your defence
 unsheathe your sword good father cry saint george'
 march enter edward george richard warwick
 norfolk montague and soldiers
edward now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace
 and set thy diadem upon my head
 or bide the mortal fortune of the field
queen margaret go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
 becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
 before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
edward i am his king and he should bow his knee
 i was adopted heir by his consent
 since when his oath is broke for as i hear
 you that are king though he do wear the crown
 have caused him by new act of parliament
 to blot out me and put his own son in
clifford and reason too
 who should succeed the father but the son
richard are you there butcher o i cannot speak
clifford ay crookback here i stand to answer thee
 or any he the proudest of thy sort
richard twas you that kill'd young rutland was it not
clifford ay and old york and yet not satisfied
richard for god's sake lords give signal to the fight
warwick what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield the crown
queen margaret why how now longtongued warwick dare you speak
 when you and i met at saint alban's last
 your legs did better service than your hands
warwick then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine
clifford you said so much before and yet you fled
warwick twas not your valour clifford drove me thence
northumberland no nor your manhood that durst make you stay
richard northumberland i hold thee reverently
 break off the parley for scarce i can refrain
 the execution of my bigswoln heart
 upon that clifford that cruel childkiller
clifford i slew thy father call'st thou him a child
richard ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
 as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland
 but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed
king henry vi have done with words my lords and hear me speak
queen margaret defy them then or else hold close thy lips
king henry vi i prithee give no limits to my tongue
 i am a king and privileged to speak
clifford my liege the wound that bred this meeting here
 cannot be cured by words therefore be still
richard then executioner unsheathe thy sword
 by him that made us all i am resolved
 that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue
edward say henry shall i have my right or no
 a thousand men have broke their fasts today
 that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
warwick if thou deny their blood upon thy head
 for york in justice puts his armour on
prince edward if that be right which warwick says is right
 there is no wrong but every thing is right
richard whoever got thee there thy mother stands
 for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue
queen margaret but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
 but like a foul misshapen stigmatic
 mark'd by the destinies to be avoided
 as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings
richard iron of naples hid with english gilt
 whose father bears the title of a king
 as if a channel should be call'd the sea
 shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
 to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart
edward a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
 to make this shameless callet know herself
 helen of greece was fairer far than thou
 although thy husband may be menelaus
 and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'd
 by that false woman as this king by thee
 his father revell'd in the heart of france
 and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop
 and had he match'd according to his state
 he might have kept that glory to this day
 but when he took a beggar to his bed
 and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday
 even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him
 that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france
 and heap'd sedition on his crown at home
 for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride
 hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
 and we in pity of the gentle king
 had slipp'd our claim until another age
george but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
 and that thy summer bred us no increase
 we set the axe to thy usurping root
 and though the edge hath something hit ourselves
 yet know thou since we have begun to strike
 we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down
 or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods
edward and in this resolution i defy thee

 since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
 sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
 and either victory or else a grave

scene iii a field of battle between towton and saxton in
 yorkshire
 alarum excursions enter warwick
warwick forspent with toil as runners with a race
 i lay me down a little while to breathe
 for strokes received and many blows repaid
 have robb'd my strongknit sinews of their strength
 and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile
 enter edward running
edward smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
 for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded
warwick how now my lord what hap what hope of good
 enter george
george our hap is loss our hope but sad despair
 our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
 what counsel give you whither shall we fly
edward bootless is flight they follow us with wings
 and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
 enter richard
richard ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
 thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
 broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance
 and in the very pangs of death he cried
 like to a dismal clangour heard from far
 warwick revenge brother revenge my death'
 so underneath the belly of their steeds
 that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood
 the noble gentleman gave up the ghost
warwick then let the earth be drunken with our blood
 i'll kill my horse because i will not fly
 why stand we like softhearted women here
 wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
 and look upon as if the tragedy
 were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors
 here on my knee i vow to god above
 i'll never pause again never stand still
 till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
 or fortune given me measure of revenge
edward o warwick i do bend my knee with thine
 and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
 and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
 i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
 thou setter up and plucker down of kings
 beseeching thee if with they will it stands
 that to my foes this body must be prey
 yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
 and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
 now lords take leave until we meet again
 where'er it be in heaven or in earth
richard brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick
 let me embrace thee in my weary arms
 i that did never weep now melt with woe
 that winter should cut off our springtime so
warwick away away once more sweet lords farewell
george yet let us all together to our troops
 and give them leave to fly that will not stay
 and call them pillars that will stand to us
 and if we thrive promise them such rewards
 as victors wear at the olympian games
 this may plant courage in their quailing breasts
 for yet is hope of life and victory
 forslow no longer make we hence amain

richard now clifford i have singled thee alone
 suppose this arm is for the duke of york
 and this for rutland both bound to revenge
 wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall
clifford now richard i am with thee here alone
 this is the hand that stabb'd thy father york
 and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland
 and here's the heart that triumphs in their death
 and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother

scene v another part of the field
 alarum enter king henry vi alone
king henry vi this battle fares like to the morning's war
 when dying clouds contend with growing light
 what time the shepherd blowing of his nails
 can neither call it perfect day nor night
 now sways it this way like a mighty sea
 forced by the tide to combat with the wind
 now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
 forced to retire by fury of the wind
 sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
 now one the better then another best
 both tugging to be victors breast to breast
 yet neither conqueror nor conquered
 so is the equal of this fell war
 here on this molehill will i sit me down
 to whom god will there be the victory
 for margaret my queen and clifford too
 have chid me from the battle swearing both
 they prosper best of all when i am thence
 would i were dead if god's good will were so
 for what is in this world but grief and woe
 o god methinks it were a happy life
 to be no better than a homely swain
 to sit upon a hill as i do now
 to carve out dials quaintly point by point
 thereby to see the minutes how they run
 how many make the hour full complete
 how many hours bring about the day
 how many days will finish up the year
 how many years a mortal man may live
 when this is known then to divide the times
 so many hours must i tend my flock
 so many hours must i take my rest
 so many hours must i contemplate
 so many hours must i sport myself
 so many days my ewes have been with young
 so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
 so many years ere i shall shear the fleece
 so minutes hours days months and years
 pass'd over to the end they were created
 would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
 ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
 gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade
 to shepherds looking on their silly sheep
 than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
 to kings that fear their subjects treachery
 o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
 and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds
 his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
 his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade
 all which secure and sweetly he enjoys
 is far beyond a prince's delicates
 his viands sparkling in a golden cup
 his body couched in a curious bed
 when care mistrust and treason waits on him
 alarum enter a son that has killed his father
 dragging in the dead body
son ill blows the wind that profits nobody
 this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight
 may be possessed with some store of crowns
 and i that haply take them from him now
 may yet ere night yield both my life and them
 to some man else as this dead man doth me
 who's this o god it is my father's face
 whom in this conflict i unwares have kill'd
 o heavy times begetting such events
 from london by the king was i press'd forth
 my father being the earl of warwick's man
 came on the part of york press'd by his master
 and i who at his hands received my life him
 have by my hands of life bereaved him
 pardon me god i knew not what i did
 and pardon father for i knew not thee
 my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
 and no more words till they have flow'd their fill
king henry vi o piteous spectacle o bloody times
 whiles lions war and battle for their dens
 poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
 weep wretched man i'll aid thee tear for tear
 and let our hearts and eyes like civil war
 be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief
 enter a father that has killed his son bringing in the body
father thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
 give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
 for i have bought it with an hundred blows
 but let me see is this our foeman's face
 ah no no no it is mine only son
 ah boy if any life be left in thee
 throw up thine eye see see what showers arise
 blown with the windy tempest of my heart
 upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart
 o pity god this miserable age
 what stratagems how fell how butcherly
 erroneous mutinous and unnatural
 this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
 o boy thy father gave thee life too soon
 and hath bereft thee of thy life too late
king henry vi woe above woe grief more than common grief
 o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
 o pity pity gentle heaven pity
 the red rose and the white are on his face
 the fatal colours of our striving houses
 the one his purple blood right well resembles
 the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
 wither one rose and let the other flourish
 if you contend a thousand lives must wither
son how will my mother for a father's death
 take on with me and ne'er be satisfied
father how will my wife for slaughter of my son
 shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied
king henry vi how will the country for these woful chances
 misthink the king and not be satisfied
son was ever son so rued a father's death
father was ever father so bemoan'd his son
king henry vi was ever king so grieved for subjects woe
 much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
son i'll bear thee hence where i may weep my fill
 exit with the body
father these arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet
 my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
 for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go
 my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
 and so obsequious will thy father be
 even for the loss of thee having no more
 as priam was for all his valiant sons
 i'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will
 for i have murdered where i should not kill
 exit with the body
king henry vi sadhearted men much overgone with care
 here sits a king more woful than you are

scene vi another part of the field
 a loud alarum enter clifford wounded
clifford here burns my candle out ay here it dies
 which whiles it lasted gave king henry light
 o lancaster i fear thy overthrow
 more than my body's parting with my soul
 my love and fear glued many friends to thee
 and now i fall thy tough commixture melts
 impairing henry strengthening misproud york
 the common people swarm like summer flies
 and whither fly the gnats but to the sun
 and who shines now but henry's enemies
 o phoebus hadst thou never given consent
 that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds
 thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth
 and henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do
 or as thy father and his father did
 giving no ground unto the house of york
 they never then had sprung like summer flies
 i and ten thousand in this luckless realm
 had left no mourning widows for our death
 and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
 for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
 and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
 bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
 no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
 the foe is merciless and will not pity
 for at their hands i have deserved no pity
 the air hath got into my deadly wounds
 and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
 come york and richard warwick and the rest
 i stabb'd your fathers bosoms split my breast
 he faints
 alarum and retreat enter edward george richard
 montague warwick and soldiers
edward now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause
 and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
 some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen
 that led calm henry though he were a king
 as doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust
 command an argosy to stem the waves
 but think you lords that clifford fled with them
warwick no tis impossible he should escape
 for though before his face i speak the words
 your brother richard mark'd him for the grave
 and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead
 clifford groans and dies
edward whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
richard a deadly groan like life and death's departing
edward see who it is and now the battle's ended
 if friend or foe let him be gently used
richard revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford
 who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
 in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth
 but set his murdering knife unto the root
 from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
 i mean our princely father duke of york
warwick from off the gates of york fetch down the head
 your father's head which clifford placed there
 instead whereof let this supply the room
 measure for measure must be answered
edward bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house
 that nothing sung but death to us and ours
 now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
 and his illboding tongue no more shall speak
warwick i think his understanding is bereft
 speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
 dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life
 and he nor sees nor hears us what we say
richard o would he did and so perhaps he doth
 tis but his policy to counterfeit
 because he would avoid such bitter taunts
 which in the time of death he gave our father
george if so thou think'st vex him with eager words
richard clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
edward clifford repent in bootless penitence
warwick clifford devise excuses for thy faults
george while we devise fell tortures for thy faults
richard thou didst love york and i am son to york
edward thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee
george where's captain margaret to fence you now
warwick they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont
richard what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
 when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
 i know by that he's dead and by my soul
 if this right hand would buy two hour's life
 that i in all despite might rail at him
 this hand should chop it off and with the
 issuing blood
 stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
 york and young rutland could not satisfy
warwick ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head
 and rear it in the place your father's stands
 and now to london with triumphant march
 there to be crowned england's royal king
 from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france
 and ask the lady bona for thy queen
 so shalt thou sinew both these lands together
 and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread
 the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again
 for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
 yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
 first will i see the coronation
 and then to brittany i'll cross the sea
 to effect this marriage so it please my lord
edward even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be
 for in thy shoulder do i build my seat
 and never will i undertake the thing
 wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
 richard i will create thee duke of gloucester
 and george of clarence warwick as ourself
 shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
richard let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester
 for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous
warwick tut that's a foolish observation
 richard be duke of gloucester now to london
 to see these honours in possession

scene i a forest in the north of england
 enter two keepers with crossbows in their hands
first keeper under this thickgrown brake we'll shroud ourselves
 for through this laund anon the deer will come
 and in this covert will we make our stand
 culling the principal of all the deer
second keeper i'll stay above the hill so both may shoot
first keeper that cannot be the noise of thy crossbow
 will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
 here stand we both and aim we at the best
 and for the time shall not seem tedious
 i'll tell thee what befell me on a day
 in this selfplace where now we mean to stand
second keeper here comes a man let's stay till he be past
 enter king henry vi disguised with a prayerbook
king henry vi from scotland am i stol'n even of pure love
 to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
 no harry harry tis no land of thine
 thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee
 thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed
 no bending knee will call thee caesar now
 no humble suitors press to speak for right
 no not a man comes for redress of thee
 for how can i help them and not myself
first keeper ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee
 this is the quondam king let's seize upon him
king henry vi let me embrace thee sour adversity
 for wise men say it is the wisest course
second keeper why linger we let us lay hands upon him
first keeper forbear awhile we'll hear a little more
king henry vi my queen and son are gone to france for aid
 and as i hear the great commanding warwick
 is thither gone to crave the french king's sister
 to wife for edward if this news be true
 poor queen and son your labour is but lost
 for warwick is a subtle orator
 and lewis a prince soon won with moving words
 by this account then margaret may win him
 for she's a woman to be pitied much
 her sighs will make a battery in his breast
 her tears will pierce into a marble heart
 the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
 and nero will be tainted with remorse
 to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
 ay but she's come to beg warwick to give
 she on his left side craving aid for henry
 he on his right asking a wife for edward
 she weeps and says her henry is deposed
 he smiles and says his edward is install'd
 that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
 whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
 inferreth arguments of mighty strength
 and in conclusion wins the king from her
 with promise of his sister and what else
 to strengthen and support king edward's place
 o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
 art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn
second keeper say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens
king henry vi more than i seem and less than i was born to
 a man at least for less i should not be
 and men may talk of kings and why not i
second keeper ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king
king henry vi why so i am in mind and that's enough
second keeper but if thou be a king where is thy crown
king henry vi my crown is in my heart not on my head
 not decked with diamonds and indian stones
 nor to be seen my crown is called content
 a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
second keeper well if you be a king crown'd with content
 your crown content and you must be contented
 to go along with us for as we think
 you are the king king edward hath deposed
 and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
 will apprehend you as his enemy
king henry vi but did you never swear and break an oath
second keeper no never such an oath nor will not now
king henry vi where did you dwell when i was king of england
second keeper here in this country where we now remain
king henry vi i was anointed king at nine months old
 my father and my grandfather were kings
 and you were sworn true subjects unto me
 and tell me then have you not broke your oaths
first keeper no
 for we were subjects but while you were king
king henry vi why am i dead do i not breathe a man
 ah simple men you know not what you swear
 look as i blow this feather from my face
 and as the air blows it to me again
 obeying with my wind when i do blow
 and yielding to another when it blows
 commanded always by the greater gust
 such is the lightness of you common men
 but do not break your oaths for of that sin
 my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
 go where you will the king shall be commanded
 and be you kings command and i'll obey
first keeper we are true subjects to the king king edward
king henry vi so would you be again to henry
 if he were seated as king edward is
first keeper we charge you in god's name and the king's
 to go with us unto the officers
king henry vi in god's name lead your king's name be obey'd
 and what god will that let your king perform
 and what he will i humbly yield unto

 gloucester and clarence retire
king edward iv now tell me madam do you love your children
lady grey ay full as dearly as i love myself
king edward iv and would you not do much to do them good
lady grey to do them good i would sustain some harm
king edward iv then get your husband's lands to do them good
lady grey therefore i came unto your majesty
king edward iv i'll tell you how these lands are to be got
lady grey so shall you bind me to your highness service
king edward iv what service wilt thou do me if i give them
lady grey what you command that rests in me to do
king edward iv but you will take exceptions to my boon
lady grey no gracious lord except i cannot do it
king edward iv ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask
lady grey why then i will do what your grace commands
gloucester aside to clarence he plies her hard and much rain
 wears the marble
clarence aside to gloucester as red as fire nay then
 her wax must melt
lady grey why stops my lord shall i not hear my task
king edward iv an easy task tis but to love a king
lady grey that's soon perform'd because i am a subject
king edward iv why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee
lady grey i take my leave with many thousand thanks
gloucester aside to clarence the match is made she seals it
 with a curtsy
king edward iv but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean
lady grey the fruits of love i mean my loving liege
king edward iv ay but i fear me in another sense
 what love think'st thou i sue so much to get
lady grey my love till death my humble thanks my prayers
 that love which virtue begs and virtue grants
king edward iv no by my troth i did not mean such love
lady grey why then you mean not as i thought you did
king edward iv but now you partly may perceive my mind
lady grey my mind will never grant what i perceive
 your highness aims at if i aim aright
king edward iv to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee
lady grey to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison
king edward iv why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands
lady grey why then mine honesty shall be my dower
 for by that loss i will not purchase them
king edward iv therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily
lady grey herein your highness wrongs both them and me
 but mighty lord this merry inclination
 accords not with the sadness of my suit
 please you dismiss me either with ay or no'
king edward iv ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
 no if thou dost say no to my demand
lady grey then no my lord my suit is at an end
gloucester aside to clarence the widow likes him not she
 knits her brows
clarence aside to gloucester he is the bluntest wooer in
 christendom
king edward iv aside her looks do argue her replete with modesty
 her words do show her wit incomparable
 all her perfections challenge sovereignty
 one way or other she is for a king
 and she shall be my love or else my queen
 say that king edward take thee for his queen
lady grey tis better said than done my gracious lord
 i am a subject fit to jest withal
 but far unfit to be a sovereign
king edward iv sweet widow by my state i swear to thee
 i speak no more than what my soul intends
 and that is to enjoy thee for my love
lady grey and that is more than i will yield unto
 i know i am too mean to be your queen
 and yet too good to be your concubine
king edward iv you cavil widow i did mean my queen
lady grey twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father
king edward iv no more than when my daughters call thee mother
 thou art a widow and thou hast some children
 and by god's mother i being but a bachelor
 have other some why tis a happy thing
 to be the father unto many sons
 answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
gloucester aside to clarence the ghostly father now hath done
 his shrift
clarence aside to gloucester when he was made a shriver
 twas for shift
king edward iv brothers you muse what chat we two have had
gloucester the widow likes it not for she looks very sad
king edward iv you'll think it strange if i should marry her
clarence to whom my lord
king edward iv why clarence to myself
gloucester that would be ten days wonder at the least
clarence that's a day longer than a wonder lasts
gloucester by so much is the wonder in extremes
king edward iv well jest on brothers i can tell you both
 her suit is granted for her husband's lands
 enter a nobleman
nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken
 and brought your prisoner to your palace gate
king edward iv see that he be convey'd unto the tower
 and go we brothers to the man that took him
 to question of his apprehension
 widow go you along lords use her honourably
 exeunt all but gloucester
gloucester ay edward will use women honourably
 would he were wasted marrow bones and all
 that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
 to cross me from the golden time i look for
 and yet between my soul's desire and me
 the lustful edward's title buried
 is clarence henry and his son young edward
 and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies
 to take their rooms ere i can place myself
 a cold premeditation for my purpose
 why then i do but dream on sovereignty
 like one that stands upon a promontory
 and spies a faroff shore where he would tread
 wishing his foot were equal with his eye
 and chides the sea that sunders him from thence
 saying he'll lade it dry to have his way
 so do i wish the crown being so far off
 and so i chide the means that keeps me from it
 and so i say i'll cut the causes off
 flattering me with impossibilities
 my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much
 unless my hand and strength could equal them
 well say there is no kingdom then for richard
 what other pleasure can the world afford
 i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap
 and deck my body in gay ornaments
 and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
 o miserable thought and more unlikely
 than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
 why love forswore me in my mother's womb
 and for i should not deal in her soft laws
 she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
 to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub
 to make an envious mountain on my back
 where sits deformity to mock my body
 to shape my legs of an unequal size
 to disproportion me in every part
 like to a chaos or an unlick'd bearwhelp
 that carries no impression like the dam
 and am i then a man to be beloved
 o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
 then since this earth affords no joy to me
 but to command to cheque to o'erbear such
 as are of better person than myself
 i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown
 and whiles i live to account this world but hell
 until my misshaped trunk that bears this head
 be round impaled with a glorious crown
 and yet i know not how to get the crown
 for many lives stand between me and home
 and ilike one lost in a thorny wood
 that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns
 seeking a way and straying from the way
 not knowing how to find the open air
 but toiling desperately to find it out
 torment myself to catch the english crown
 and from that torment i will free myself
 or hew my way out with a bloody axe
 why i can smile and murder whiles i smile
 and cry content to that which grieves my heart
 and wet my cheeks with artificial tears
 and frame my face to all occasions
 i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
 i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk
 i'll play the orator as well as nestor
 deceive more slily than ulysses could
 and like a sinon take another troy
 i can add colours to the chameleon
 change shapes with proteus for advantages
 and set the murderous machiavel to school
 can i do this and cannot get a crown
 tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down

 sit down with us it ill befits thy state
 and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit
queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret
 must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
 where kings command i was i must confess
 great albion's queen in former golden days
 but now mischance hath trod my title down
 and with dishonour laid me on the ground
 where i must take like seat unto my fortune
 and to my humble seat conform myself
king lewis xi why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
 and stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares
king lewis xi whate'er it be be thou still like thyself
 and sit thee by our side
 seats her by him
 yield not thy neck
 to fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind
 still ride in triumph over all mischance
 be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief
 it shall be eased if france can yield relief
queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
 and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak
 now therefore be it known to noble lewis
 that henry sole possessor of my love
 is of a king become a banish'd man
 and forced to live in scotland a forlorn
 while proud ambitious edward duke of york
 usurps the regal title and the seat
 of england's trueanointed lawful king
 this is the cause that i poor margaret

 am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
 and if thou fail us all our hope is done
 scotland hath will to help but cannot help
 our people and our peers are both misled
 our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight
 and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
king lewis xi renowned queen with patience calm the storm
 while we bethink a means to break it off
queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe
king lewis xi the more i stay the more i'll succor thee
queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
 and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
 enter warwick
king lewis xi what's he approacheth boldly to our presence
queen margaret our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend
king lewis xi welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france
 he descends she ariseth
queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise
 for this is he that moves both wind and tide
warwick from worthy edward king of albion
 my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
 i come in kindness and unfeigned love
 first to do greetings to thy royal person
 and then to crave a league of amity
 and lastly to confirm that amity
 with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
 that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister
 to england's king in lawful marriage
queen margaret aside if that go forward henry's hope is done
warwick to bona and gracious madam in our king's behalf
 i am commanded with your leave and favour
 humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
 to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart
 where fame late entering at his heedful ears
 hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue
queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak
 before you answer warwick his demand
 springs not from edward's wellmeant honest love
 but from deceit bred by necessity
 for how can tyrants safely govern home
 unless abroad they purchase great alliance
 to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
 that henry liveth still but were he dead
 yet here prince edward stands king henry's son
 look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage
 thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
 for though usurpers sway the rule awhile
 yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs
warwick injurious margaret
prince edward and why not queen
warwick because thy father henry did usurp
 and thou no more are prince than she is queen
oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt
 which did subdue the greatest part of spain
 and after john of gaunt henry the fourth
 whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
 and after that wise prince henry the fifth
 who by his prowess conquered all france
 from these our henry lineally descends
warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
 you told not how henry the sixth hath lost
 all that which henry fifth had gotten
 methinks these peers of france should smile at that
 but for the rest you tell a pedigree
 of threescore and two years a silly time
 to make prescription for a kingdom's worth
oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
 whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years
 and not bewray thy treason with a blush
warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right
 now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
 for shame leave henry and call edward king
oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom
 my elder brother the lord aubrey vere
 was done to death and more than so my father
 even in the downfall of his mellow'd years
 when nature brought him to the door of death
 no warwick no while life upholds this arm
 this arm upholds the house of lancaster
warwick and i the house of york
king lewis xi queen margaret prince edward and oxford
 vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
 while i use further conference with warwick
 they stand aloof
queen margaret heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not
king lewis xi now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
 is edward your true king for i were loath
 to link with him that were not lawful chosen
warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour
king lewis xi but is he gracious in the people's eye
warwick the more that henry was unfortunate
king lewis xi then further all dissembling set aside
 tell me for truth the measure of his love
 unto our sister bona
warwick such it seems
 as may beseem a monarch like himself
 myself have often heard him say and swear
 that this his love was an eternal plant
 whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground
 the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun
 exempt from envy but not from disdain
 unless the lady bona quit his pain
king lewis xi now sister let us hear your firm resolve
bona your grant or your denial shall be mine
 to warwick
 yet i confess that often ere this day
 when i have heard your king's desert recounted
 mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
king lewis xi then warwick thus our sister shall be edward's
 and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
 touching the jointure that your king must make
 which with her dowry shall be counterpoised
 draw near queen margaret and be a witness
 that bona shall be wife to the english king
prince edward to edward but not to the english king
queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device
 by this alliance to make void my suit
 before thy coming lewis was henry's friend
king lewis xi and still is friend to him and margaret
 but if your title to the crown be weak
 as may appear by edward's good success
 then tis but reason that i be released
 from giving aid which late i promised
 yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
 that your estate requires and mine can yield
warwick henry now lives in scotland at his ease
 where having nothing nothing can he lose
 and as for you yourself our quondam queen
 you have a father able to maintain you
 and better twere you troubled him than france
queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick peace
 proud setter up and puller down of kings
 i will not hence till with my talk and tears
 both full of truth i make king lewis behold
 thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love
 for both of you are birds of selfsame feather
 post blows a horn within
king lewis xi warwick this is some post to us or thee
 enter a post
post to warwick my lord ambassador these letters are for you
 sent from your brother marquess montague
 to king lewis xi
 these from our king unto your majesty
 to queen margaret
 and madam these for you from whom i know not
 they all read their letters
oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress
 smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his
prince edward nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled
 i hope all's for the best
king lewis xi warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen
queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys
warwick mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent
king lewis xi what has your king married the lady grey
 and now to soothe your forgery and his
 sends me a paper to persuade me patience
 is this the alliance that he seeks with france
 dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
queen margaret i told your majesty as much before
 this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty
warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven
 and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss
 that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's
 no more my king for he dishonours me
 but most himself if he could see his shame
 did i forget that by the house of york
 my father came untimely to his death
 did i let pass the abuse done to my niece
 did i impale him with the regal crown
 did i put henry from his native right
 and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame
 shame on himself for my desert is honour
 and to repair my honour lost for him
 i here renounce him and return to henry
 my noble queen let former grudges pass
 and henceforth i am thy true servitor
 i will revenge his wrong to lady bona
 and replant henry in his former state
queen margaret warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love
 and i forgive and quite forget old faults
 and joy that thou becomest king henry's friend
warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
 that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
 with some few bands of chosen soldiers
 i'll undertake to land them on our coast
 and force the tyrant from his seat by war
 tis not his newmade bride shall succor him
 and as for clarence as my letters tell me
 he's very likely now to fall from him
 for matching more for wanton lust than honour
 or than for strength and safety of our country
bona dear brother how shall bona be revenged
 but by thy help to this distressed queen
queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live
 unless thou rescue him from foul despair
bona my quarrel and this english queen's are one
warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours
king lewis xi and mine with hers and thine and margaret's
 therefore at last i firmly am resolved
 you shall have aid
queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once
king lewis xi then england's messenger return in post
 and tell false edward thy supposed king
 that lewis of france is sending over masquers
 to revel it with him and his new bride
 thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal
bona tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
 i'll wear the willow garland for his sake
queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
 and i am ready to put armour on
warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
 and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long
 there's thy reward be gone
 exit post
king lewis xi but warwick
 thou and oxford with five thousand men
 shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle
 and as occasion serves this noble queen
 and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
 yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
 what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty
 that if our queen and this young prince agree
 i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
 to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion
 son edward she is fair and virtuous
 therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick
 and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
 that only warwick's daughter shall be thine
prince edward yes i accept her for she well deserves it
 and here to pledge my vow i give my hand
 he gives his hand to warwick
king lewis xi why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied
 and thou lord bourbon our high admiral
 shalt waft them over with our royal fleet
 i long till edward fall by war's mischance
 for mocking marriage with a dame of france
 exeunt all but warwick
warwick i came from edward as ambassador
 but i return his sworn and mortal foe
 matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
 but dreadful war shall answer his demand
 had he none else to make a stale but me
 then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow
 i was the chief that raised him to the crown
 and i'll be chief to bring him down again
 not that i pity henry's misery
 but seek revenge on edward's mockery

act iv
scene i london the palace
 enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague
gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you
 of this new marriage with the lady grey
 hath not our brother made a worthy choice
clarence alas you know tis far from hence to france
 how could he stay till warwick made return
somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king
gloucester and his wellchosen bride
clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think
 flourish enter king edward iv attended queen
 elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others
king edward iv now brother of clarence how like you our choice
 that you stand pensive as half malcontent
clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick
 which are so weak of courage and in judgment
 that they'll take no offence at our abuse
king edward iv suppose they take offence without a cause
 they are but lewis and warwick i am edward
 your king and warwick's and must have my will
gloucester and shall have your will because our king
 yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
king edward iv yea brother richard are you offended too
gloucester not i
 no god forbid that i should wish them sever'd
 whom god hath join'd together ay and twere pity
 to sunder them that yoke so well together
king edward iv setting your scorns and your mislike aside
 tell me some reason why the lady grey
 should not become my wife and england's queen
 and you too somerset and montague
 speak freely what you think
clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis
 becomes your enemy for mocking him
 about the marriage of the lady bona
gloucester and warwick doing what you gave in charge
 is now dishonoured by this new marriage
king edward iv what if both lewis and warwick be appeased
 by such invention as i can devise
montague yet to have join'd with france in such alliance
 would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
 gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage
hastings why knows not montague that of itself
 england is safe if true within itself
montague but the safer when tis back'd with france
hastings tis better using france than trusting france
 let us be back'd with god and with the seas
 which he hath given for fence impregnable
 and with their helps only defend ourselves
 in them and in ourselves our safety lies
clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves
 to have the heir of the lord hungerford
king edward iv ay what of that it was my will and grant
 and for this once my will shall stand for law
gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well
 to give the heir and daughter of lord scales
 unto the brother of your loving bride
 she better would have fitted me or clarence
 but in your bride you bury brotherhood
clarence or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
 of the lord bonville on your new wife's son
 and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
king edward iv alas poor clarence is it for a wife
 that thou art malcontent i will provide thee
clarence in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment
 which being shallow you give me leave
 to play the broker in mine own behalf
 and to that end i shortly mind to leave you
king edward iv leave me or tarry edward will be king
 and not be tied unto his brother's will
queen elizabeth my lords before it pleased his majesty
 to raise my state to title of a queen
 do me but right and you must all confess
 that i was not ignoble of descent
 and meaner than myself have had like fortune
 but as this title honours me and mine
 so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing
 doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
king edward iv my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
 what danger or what sorrow can befall thee
 so long as edward is thy constant friend
 and their true sovereign whom they must obey
 nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
 unless they seek for hatred at my hands
 which if they do yet will i keep thee safe
 and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
gloucester aside i hear yet say not much but think the more
 enter a post
king edward iv now messenger what letters or what news
 from france
post my sovereign liege no letters and few words
 but such as i without your special pardon
 dare not relate
king edward iv go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
 tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
 what answer makes king lewis unto our letters
post at my depart these were his very words
 go tell false edward thy supposed king
 that lewis of france is sending over masquers
 to revel it with him and his new bride'
king edward iv is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry
 but what said lady bona to my marriage
post these were her words utter'd with mad disdain
 tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
 i'll wear the willow garland for his sake'
king edward iv i blame not her she could say little less
 she had the wrong but what said henry's queen
 for i have heard that she was there in place
post tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
 and i am ready to put armour on'
king edward iv belike she minds to play the amazon
 but what said warwick to these injuries
post he more incensed against your majesty
 than all the rest discharged me with these words
 tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
 and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long'
king edward iv ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
 well i will arm me being thus forewarn'd
 they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
 but say is warwick friends with margaret
post ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in
 friendship
 that young prince edward marries warwick's daughter
clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger
 now brother king farewell and sit you fast
 for i will hence to warwick's other daughter
 that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage
 i may not prove inferior to yourself
 you that love me and warwick follow me
 exit clarence and somerset follows
gloucester aside not i
 my thoughts aim at a further matter i
 stay not for the love of edward but the crown
king edward iv clarence and somerset both gone to warwick
 yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen
 and haste is needful in this desperate case
 pembroke and stafford you in our behalf
 go levy men and make prepare for war
 they are already or quickly will be landed
 myself in person will straight follow you
 exeunt pembroke and stafford
 but ere i go hastings and montague
 resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest
 are near to warwick by blood and by alliance
 tell me if you love warwick more than me
 if it be so then both depart to him
 i rather wish you foes than hollow friends
 but if you mind to hold your true obedience
 give me assurance with some friendly vow
 that i may never have you in suspect
montague so god help montague as he proves true
hastings and hastings as he favours edward's cause
king edward iv now brother richard will you stand by us
gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
king edward iv why so then am i sure of victory
 now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
 till we meet warwick with his foreign power

warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
 the common people by numbers swarm to us
 enter clarence and somerset
 but see where somerset and clarence come
 speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
clarence fear not that my lord
warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick
 and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice
 to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
 hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love
 else might i think that clarence edward's brother
 were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
 but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine
 and now what rests but in night's coverture
 thy brother being carelessly encamp'd
 his soldiers lurking in the towns about
 and but attended by a simple guard
 we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
 our scouts have found the adventure very easy
 that as ulysses and stout diomede
 with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents
 and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds
 so we well cover'd with the night's black mantle
 at unawares may beat down edward's guard
 and seize himself i say not slaughter him
 for i intend but only to surprise him
 you that will follow me to this attempt
 applaud the name of henry with your leader
 they all cry henry'
 why then let's on our way in silent sort

first watchman why no for he hath made a solemn vow
 never to lie and take his natural rest
 till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd
second watchman tomorrow then belike shall be the day
 if warwick be so near as men report
third watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that
 that with the king here resteth in his tent
first watchman tis the lord hastings the king's chiefest friend
third watchman o is it so but why commands the king
 that his chief followers lodge in towns about him
 while he himself keeps in the cold field
second watchman tis the more honour because more dangerous
third watchman ay but give me worship and quietness
 i like it better than a dangerous honour
 if warwick knew in what estate he stands
 tis to be doubted he would waken him
first watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage
second watchman ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
 but to defend his person from nightfoes
 enter warwick clarence oxford somerset and
 french soldiers silent all
warwick this is his tent and see where stand his guard

king edward iv the duke why warwick when we parted
 thou call'dst me king
warwick ay but the case is alter'd
 when you disgraced me in my embassade
 then i degraded you from being king
 and come now to create you duke of york
 alas how should you govern any kingdom
 that know not how to use ambassadors
 nor how to be contented with one wife
 nor how to use your brothers brotherly
 nor how to study for the people's welfare
 nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
king edward iv yea brother of clarence are thou here too
 nay then i see that edward needs must down
 yet warwick in despite of all mischance
 of thee thyself and all thy complices
 edward will always bear himself as king
 though fortune's malice overthrow my state
 my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
warwick then for his mind be edward england's king
 takes off his crown
 but henry now shall wear the english crown
 and be true king indeed thou but the shadow
 my lord of somerset at my request
 see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd
 unto my brother archbishop of york
 when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows
 i'll follow you and tell what answer
 lewis and the lady bona send to him
 now for a while farewell good duke of york
 they lead him out forcibly

 it boots not to resist both wind and tide

queen elizabeth why brother rivers are you yet to learn
 what late misfortune is befall'n king edward
rivers what loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick
queen elizabeth no but the loss of his own royal person
rivers then is my sovereign slain
queen elizabeth ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
 either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
 or by his foe surprised at unawares
 and as i further have to understand
 is new committed to the bishop of york
 fell warwick's brother and by that our foe
rivers these news i must confess are full of grief
 yet gracious madam bear it as you may
 warwick may lose that now hath won the day
queen elizabeth till then fair hope must hinder life's decay
 and i the rather wean me from despair
 for love of edward's offspring in my womb
 this is it that makes me bridle passion
 and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross
 ay ay for this i draw in many a tear
 and stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs
 lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown
 king edward's fruit true heir to the english crown
rivers but madam where is warwick then become
queen elizabeth i am inform'd that he comes towards london
 to set the crown once more on henry's head
 guess thou the rest king edward's friends must down
 but to prevent the tyrant's violence
 for trust not him that hath once broken faith
 i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
 to save at least the heir of edward's right
 there shall i rest secure from force and fraud

 into this chiefest thicket of the park
 thus stands the case you know our king my brother
 is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
 he hath good usage and great liberty
 and often but attended with weak guard
 comes hunting this way to disport himself
 i have advertised him by secret means
 that if about this hour he make his way
 under the colour of his usual game
 he shall here find his friends with horse and men
 to set him free from his captivity
 enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him
huntsman this way my lord for this way lies the game
king edward iv nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand
 now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest
 stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer
gloucester brother the time and case requireth haste
 your horse stands ready at the parkcorner
king edward iv but whither shall we then
hastings to lynn my lord

gloucester well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning
king edward iv stanley i will requite thy forwardness
gloucester but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk
king edward iv huntsman what say'st thou wilt thou go along
huntsman better do so than tarry and be hang'd

 somerset henry of richmond oxford montague and
 lieutenant of the tower
king henry vi master lieutenant now that god and friends
 have shaken edward from the regal seat
 and turn'd my captive state to liberty
 my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
 at our enlargement what are thy due fees
lieutenant subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
 but if an humble prayer may prevail
 i then crave pardon of your majesty
king henry vi for what lieutenant for well using me
 nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness
 for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
 ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
 conceive when after many moody thoughts
 at last by notes of household harmony
 they quite forget their loss of liberty
 but warwick after god thou set'st me free
 and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee
 he was the author thou the instrument
 therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite
 by living low where fortune cannot hurt me
 and that the people of this blessed land
 may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars
 warwick although my head still wear the crown
 i here resign my government to thee
 for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
warwick your grace hath still been famed for virtuous
 and now may seem as wise as virtuous
 by spying and avoiding fortune's malice
 for few men rightly temper with the stars
 yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
 for choosing me when clarence is in place
clarence no warwick thou art worthy of the sway
 to whom the heavens in thy nativity
 adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
 as likely to be blest in peace and war
 and therefore i yield thee my free consent
warwick and i choose clarence only for protector
king henry vi warwick and clarence give me both your hands
 now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
 that no dissension hinder government
 i make you both protectors of this land
 while i myself will lead a private life
 and in devotion spend my latter days
 to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise
warwick what answers clarence to his sovereign's will
clarence that he consents if warwick yield consent
 for on thy fortune i repose myself
warwick why then though loath yet must i be content
 we'll yoke together like a double shadow
 to henry's body and supply his place
 i mean in bearing weight of government
 while he enjoys the honour and his ease
 and clarence now then it is more than needful
 forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor
 and all his lands and goods be confiscate
clarence what else and that succession be determined
warwick ay therein clarence shall not want his part
king henry vi but with the first of all your chief affairs
 let me entreat for i command no more
 that margaret your queen and my son edward
 be sent for to return from france with speed
 for till i see them here by doubtful fear
 my joy of liberty is half eclipsed
clarence it shall be done my sovereign with all speed
king henry vi my lord of somerset what youth is that
 of whom you seem to have so tender care
somerset my liege it is young henry earl of richmond
king henry vi come hither england's hope
 lays his hand on his head
 if secret powers
 suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
 this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss
 his looks are full of peaceful majesty
 his head by nature framed to wear a crown
 his hand to wield a sceptre and himself
 likely in time to bless a regal throne
 make much of him my lords for this is he
 must help you more than you are hurt by me
 enter a post
warwick what news my friend
post that edward is escaped from your brother
 and fled as he hears since to burgundy
warwick unsavoury news but how made he escape
post he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester
 and the lord hastings who attended him
 in secret ambush on the forest side
 and from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him
 for hunting was his daily exercise
warwick my brother was too careless of his charge
 but let us hence my sovereign to provide
 a salve for any sore that may betide
 exeunt all but somerset henry of richmond and oxford
somerset my lord i like not of this flight of edward's
 for doubtless burgundy will yield him help
 and we shall have more wars before t be long
 as henry's late presaging prophecy
 did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond
 so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
 what may befall him to his harm and ours
 therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst
 forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany
 till storms be past of civil enmity
oxford ay for if edward repossess the crown
 tis like that richmond with the rest shall down
somerset it shall be so he shall to brittany

 well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas

 what then remains we being thus arrived
 from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york
 but that we enter as into our dukedom
gloucester the gates made fast brother i like not this
 for many men that stumble at the threshold
 are well foretold that danger lurks within
king edward iv tush man abodements must not now affright us
 by fair or foul means we must enter in
 for hither will our friends repair to us
hastings my liege i'll knock once more to summon them
 enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren
mayor my lords we were forewarned of your coming
 and shut the gates for safety of ourselves
 for now we owe allegiance unto henry
king edward iv but master mayor if henry be your king
 yet edward at the least is duke of york
mayor true my good lord i know you for no less
king edward iv why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom
 as being well content with that alone

 i came to serve a king and not a duke
 drummer strike up and let us march away

 to keep them back that come to succor you
 why shall we fight if you pretend no title
gloucester why brother wherefore stand you on nice points

exeter the doubt is that he will seduce the rest
king henry vi that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame
 i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands
 nor posted off their suits with slow delays
 my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
 my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs
 my mercy dried their waterflowing tears
 i have not been desirous of their wealth
 nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies
 nor forward of revenge though they much err'd
 then why should they love edward more than me

warwick nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
 confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own
 call warwick patron and be penitent
 and thou shalt still remain the duke of york

 or did he make the jest against his will
warwick is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
gloucester ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
 i'll do thee service for so good a gift

clarence father of warwick know you what this means
 taking his red rose out of his hat
 look here i throw my infamy at thee
 i will not ruinate my father's house
 who gave his blood to lime the stones together
 and set up lancaster why trow'st thou warwick
 that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
 to bend the fatal instruments of war
 against his brother and his lawful king
 perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
 to keep that oath were more impiety
 than jephthah's when he sacrificed his daughter
 i am so sorry for my trespass made
 that to deserve well at my brother's hands
 i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
 with resolution wheresoe'er i meet thee
 as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad
 to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
 and so proudhearted warwick i defy thee
 and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
 pardon me edward i will make amends
 and richard do not frown upon my faults
 for i will henceforth be no more unconstant
king edward iv now welcome more and ten times more beloved

gloucester welcome good clarence this is brotherlike
warwick o passing traitor perjured and unjust

 why ask i that my mangled body shows

 thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge
 whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
 under whose shade the ramping lion slept
 whose topbranch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree
 and kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind
 these eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil
 have been as piercing as the midday sun
 to search the secret treasons of the world
 the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
 were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres
 for who lived king but i could dig his grave
 and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow
 lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood
 my parks my walks my manors that i had
 even now forsake me and of all my lands
 is nothing left me but my body's length
 why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
 and live we how we can yet die we must
 enter oxford and somerset
somerset ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are
 we might recover all our loss again
 the queen from france hath brought a puissant power
 even now we heard the news ah could'st thou fly
warwick why then i would not fly ah montague
 if thou be there sweet brother take my hand
 and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
 thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst
 thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
 that glues my lips and will not let me speak
 come quickly montague or i am dead
somerset ah warwick montague hath breathed his last
 and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick
 and said commend me to my valiant brother'
 and more he would have said and more he spoke
 which sounded like a clamour in a vault
 that mought not be distinguished but at last
 i well might hear delivered with a groan
 o farewell warwick'

 should if a coward heard her speak these words
 infuse his breast with magnanimity

 with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush

 have now the fatal object in my eye
 where my poor young was limed was caught and kill'd

 thy brother edward and thyself the sea
 whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
 ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
 my breast can better brook thy dagger's point
 than can my ears that tragic history
 but wherefore dost thou come is't for my life
gloucester think'st thou i am an executioner
king henry vi a persecutor i am sure thou art
 if murdering innocents be executing
 why then thou art an executioner
gloucester thy son i kill'd for his presumption
king henry vi hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume
 thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine
 and thus i prophesy that many a thousand
 which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
 and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's
 and many an orphan's waterstanding eye
 men for their sons wives for their husbands
 and orphans for their parents timeless death
 shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
 the owl shriek'd at thy birthan evil sign
 the nightcrow cried aboding luckless time
 dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees
 the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top
 and chattering pies in dismal discords sung
 thy mother felt more than a mother's pain
 and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope
 to wit an indigested and deformed lump
 not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
 teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
 to signify thou camest to bite the world
 and if the rest be true which i have heard
 thou camest

 for this amongst the rest was i ordain'd
king henry vi ay and for much more slaughter after this
 god forgive my sins and pardon thee

gloucester what will the aspiring blood of lancaster
 sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted
 see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death
 o may such purple tears be alway shed
 from those that wish the downfall of our house
 if any spark of life be yet remaining
 down down to hell and say i sent thee thither
 stabs him again
 i that have neither pity love nor fear
 indeed tis true that henry told me of
 for i have often heard my mother say
 i came into the world with my legs forward
 had i not reason think ye to make haste
 and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right
 the midwife wonder'd and the women cried
 o jesus bless us he is born with teeth'
 and so i was which plainly signified
 that i should snarl and bite and play the dog
 then since the heavens have shaped my body so
 let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it
 i have no brother i am like no brother
 and this word love which graybeards call divine
 be resident in men like one another
 and not in me i am myself alone
 clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light
 but i will sort a pitchy day for thee
 for i will buz abroad such prophecies
 that edward shall be fearful of his life
 and then to purge his fear i'll be thy death
 king henry and the prince his son are gone
 clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
 counting myself but bad till i be best
 i'll throw thy body in another room

 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus o for a muse of fire that would ascend
 the brightest heaven of invention
 a kingdom for a stage princes to act
 and monarchs to behold the swelling scene
 then should the warlike harry like himself
 assume the port of mars and at his heels
 leash'd in like hounds should famine sword and fire
 crouch for employment but pardon and gentles all
 the flat unraised spirits that have dared
 on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
 so great an object can this cockpit hold
 the vasty fields of france or may we cram
 within this wooden o the very casques
 that did affright the air at agincourt
 o pardon since a crooked figure may
 attest in little place a million
 and let us ciphers to this great accompt
 on your imaginary forces work
 suppose within the girdle of these walls
 are now confined two mighty monarchies
 whose high upreared and abutting fronts
 the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder
 piece out our imperfections with your thoughts
 into a thousand parts divide on man
 and make imaginary puissance
 think when we talk of horses that you see them
 printing their proud hoofs i the receiving earth
 for tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings
 carry them here and there jumping o'er times
 turning the accomplishment of many years
 into an hourglass for the which supply
 admit me chorus to this history
 who prologuelike your humble patience pray
 gently to hear kindly to judge our play

 king henry v
act i
scene i london an antechamber in the king's palace
 enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
canterbury my lord i'll tell you that self bill is urged
 which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
 was like and had indeed against us pass'd
 but that the scambling and unquiet time
 did push it out of farther question
ely but how my lord shall we resist it now
canterbury it must be thought on if it pass against us
 we lose the better half of our possession
 for all the temporal lands which men devout
 by testament have given to the church
 would they strip from us being valued thus
 as much as would maintain to the king's honour
 full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
 six thousand and two hundred good esquires
 and to relief of lazars and weak age
 of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
 a hundred almshouses right well supplied
 and to the coffers of the king beside
 a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill
ely this would drink deep
canterbury twould drink the cup and all
ely but what prevention
canterbury the king is full of grace and fair regard
ely and a true lover of the holy church
canterbury the courses of his youth promised it not
 the breath no sooner left his father's body
 but that his wildness mortified in him
 seem'd to die too yea at that very moment
 consideration like an angel came
 and whipp'd the offending adam out of him
 leaving his body as a paradise
 to envelop and contain celestial spirits
 never was such a sudden scholar made
 never came reformation in a flood
 with such a heady currance scouring faults
 nor never hydraheaded wilfulness
 so soon did lose his seat and all at once
 as in this king
ely we are blessed in the change
canterbury hear him but reason in divinity
 and alladmiring with an inward wish
 you would desire the king were made a prelate
 hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
 you would say it hath been all in all his study
 list his discourse of war and you shall hear
 a fearful battle render'd you in music
 turn him to any cause of policy
 the gordian knot of it he will unloose
 familiar as his garter that when he speaks
 the air a charter'd libertine is still
 and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
 to steal his sweet and honey'd sentences
 so that the art and practic part of life
 must be the mistress to this theoric
 which is a wonder how his grace should glean it
 since his addiction was to courses vain
 his companies unletter'd rude and shallow
 his hours fill'd up with riots banquets sports
 and never noted in him any study
 any retirement any sequestration
 from open haunts and popularity
ely the strawberry grows underneath the nettle
 and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
 neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality
 and so the prince obscured his contemplation
 under the veil of wildness which no doubt
 grew like the summer grass fastest by night
 unseen yet crescive in his faculty
canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceased
 and therefore we must needs admit the means
 how things are perfected
ely but my good lord
 how now for mitigation of this bill
 urged by the commons doth his majesty
 incline to it or no
canterbury he seems indifferent
 or rather swaying more upon our part
 than cherishing the exhibiters against us
 for i have made an offer to his majesty
 upon our spiritual convocation
 and in regard of causes now in hand
 which i have open'd to his grace at large
 as touching france to give a greater sum
 than ever at one time the clergy yet
 did to his predecessors part withal
ely how did this offer seem received my lord
canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty
 save that there was not time enough to hear
 as i perceived his grace would fain have done
 the severals and unhidden passages
 of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
 and generally to the crown and seat of france
 derived from edward his greatgrandfather
ely what was the impediment that broke this off
canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant
 craved audience and the hour i think is come
 to give him hearing is it four o'clock
ely it is
canterbury then go we in to know his embassy
 which i could with a ready guess declare
 before the frenchman speak a word of it
ely i'll wait upon you and i long to hear it

act i
scene ii the same the presence chamber
 enter king henry v gloucester bedford exeter
 warwick westmoreland and attendants
king henry v where is my gracious lord of canterbury
exeter not here in presence
king henry v send for him good uncle
westmoreland shall we call in the ambassador my liege
king henry v not yet my cousin we would be resolved
 before we hear him of some things of weight
 that task our thoughts concerning us and france
 enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne
 and make you long become it
king henry v sure we thank you
 my learned lord we pray you to proceed
 and justly and religiously unfold
 why the law salique that they have in france
 or should or should not bar us in our claim
 and god forbid my dear and faithful lord
 that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
 or nicely charge your understanding soul
 with opening titles miscreate whose right
 suits not in native colours with the truth
 for god doth know how many now in health
 shall drop their blood in approbation
 of what your reverence shall incite us to
 therefore take heed how you impawn our person
 how you awake our sleeping sword of war
 we charge you in the name of god take heed
 for never two such kingdoms did contend
 without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
 are every one a woe a sore complaint
 gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
 that make such waste in brief mortality
 under this conjuration speak my lord
 for we will hear note and believe in heart
 that what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
 as pure as sin with baptism
canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
 that owe yourselves your lives and services
 to this imperial throne there is no bar
 to make against your highness claim to france
 but this which they produce from pharamond
 in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant'
 no woman shall succeed in salique land'
 which salique land the french unjustly gloze
 to be the realm of france and pharamond
 the founder of this law and female bar
 yet their own authors faithfully affirm
 that the land salique is in germany
 between the floods of sala and of elbe
 where charles the great having subdued the saxons
 there left behind and settled certain french
 who holding in disdain the german women
 for some dishonest manners of their life
 establish'd then this law to wit no female
 should be inheritrix in salique land
 which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala
 is at this day in germany call'd meisen
 then doth it well appear that salique law
 was not devised for the realm of france
 nor did the french possess the salique land
 until four hundred one and twenty years
 after defunction of king pharamond
 idly supposed the founder of this law
 who died within the year of our redemption
 four hundred twentysix and charles the great
 subdued the saxons and did seat the french
 beyond the river sala in the year
 eight hundred five besides their writers say
 king pepin which deposed childeric
 did as heir general being descended
 of blithild which was daughter to king clothair
 make claim and title to the crown of france
 hugh capet also who usurped the crown
 of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male
 of the true line and stock of charles the great
 to find his title with some shows of truth
 through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
 convey'd himself as heir to the lady lingare
 daughter to charlemain who was the son
 to lewis the emperor and lewis the son
 of charles the great also king lewis the tenth
 who was sole heir to the usurper capet
 could not keep quiet in his conscience
 wearing the crown of france till satisfied
 that fair queen isabel his grandmother
 was lineal of the lady ermengare
 daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine
 by the which marriage the line of charles the great
 was reunited to the crown of france
 so that as clear as is the summer's sun
 king pepin's title and hugh capet's claim
 king lewis his satisfaction all appear
 to hold in right and title of the female
 so do the kings of france unto this day
 howbeit they would hold up this salique law
 to bar your highness claiming from the female
 and rather choose to hide them in a net
 than amply to imbar their crooked titles
 usurp'd from you and your progenitors
king henry v may i with right and conscience make this claim
canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign
 for in the book of numbers is it writ
 when the man dies let the inheritance
 descend unto the daughter gracious lord
 stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
 look back into your mighty ancestors
 go my dread lord to your greatgrandsire's tomb
 from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
 and your greatuncle's edward the black prince
 who on the french ground play'd a tragedy
 making defeat on the full power of france
 whiles his most mighty father on a hill
 stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
 forage in blood of french nobility
 o noble english that could entertain
 with half their forces the full pride of france
 and let another half stand laughing by
 all out of work and cold for action
ely awake remembrance of these valiant dead
 and with your puissant arm renew their feats
 you are their heir you sit upon their throne
 the blood and courage that renowned them
 runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege
 is in the very maymorn of his youth
 ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
 do all expect that you should rouse yourself
 as did the former lions of your blood
westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might
 so hath your highness never king of england
 had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
 whose hearts have left their bodies here in england
 and lie pavilion'd in the fields of france
canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege
 with blood and sword and fire to win your right
 in aid whereof we of the spiritualty
 will raise your highness such a mighty sum
 as never did the clergy at one time
 bring in to any of your ancestors
king henry v we must not only arm to invade the french
 but lay down our proportions to defend
 against the scot who will make road upon us
 with all advantages
canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign
 shall be a wall sufficient to defend
 our inland from the pilfering borderers
king henry v we do not mean the coursing snatchers only
 but fear the main intendment of the scot
 who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
 for you shall read that my greatgrandfather
 never went with his forces into france
 but that the scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
 came pouring like the tide into a breach
 with ample and brim fulness of his force
 galling the gleaned land with hot assays
 girding with grievous siege castles and towns
 that england being empty of defence
 hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood
canterbury she hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege
 for hear her but exampled by herself
 when all her chivalry hath been in france
 and she a mourning widow of her nobles
 she hath herself not only well defended
 but taken and impounded as a stray
 the king of scots whom she did send to france
 to fill king edward's fame with prisoner kings
 and make her chronicle as rich with praise
 as is the ooze and bottom of the sea
 with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries
westmoreland but there's a saying very old and true
 if that you will france win
 then with scotland first begin'
 for once the eagle england being in prey
 to her unguarded nest the weasel scot
 comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
 playing the mouse in absence of the cat
 to tear and havoc more than she can eat
exeter it follows then the cat must stay at home
 yet that is but a crush'd necessity
 since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
 and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
 while that the armed hand doth fight abroad
 the advised head defends itself at home
 for government though high and low and lower
 put into parts doth keep in one consent
 congreeing in a full and natural close
 like music
canterbury therefore doth heaven divide
 the state of man in divers functions
 setting endeavour in continual motion
 to which is fixed as an aim or butt
 obedience for so work the honeybees
 creatures that by a rule in nature teach
 the act of order to a peopled kingdom
 they have a king and officers of sorts
 where some like magistrates correct at home
 others like merchants venture trade abroad
 others like soldiers armed in their stings
 make boot upon the summer's velvet buds
 which pillage they with merry march bring home
 to the tentroyal of their emperor
 who busied in his majesty surveys
 the singing masons building roofs of gold
 the civil citizens kneading up the honey
 the poor mechanic porters crowding in
 their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
 the sadeyed justice with his surly hum
 delivering o'er to executors pale
 the lazy yawning drone i this infer
 that many things having full reference
 to one consent may work contrariously
 as many arrows loosed several ways
 come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
 as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
 as many lines close in the dial's centre
 so may a thousand actions once afoot
 end in one purpose and be all well borne
 without defeat therefore to france my liege
 divide your happy england into four
 whereof take you one quarter into france
 and you withal shall make all gallia shake
 if we with thrice such powers left at home
 cannot defend our own doors from the dog
 let us be worried and our nation lose
 the name of hardiness and policy
king henry v call in the messengers sent from the dauphin
 exeunt some attendants
 now are we well resolved and by god's help
 and yours the noble sinews of our power
 france being ours we'll bend it to our awe
 or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit
 ruling in large and ample empery
 o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms
 or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
 tombless with no remembrance over them
 either our history shall with full mouth
 speak freely of our acts or else our grave
 like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
 not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph
 enter ambassadors of france
 now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
 of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear
 your greeting is from him not from the king
first ambassador may't please your majesty to give us leave
 freely to render what we have in charge
 or shall we sparingly show you far off
 the dauphin's meaning and our embassy
king henry v we are no tyrant but a christian king
 unto whose grace our passion is as subject
 as are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons
 therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
 tell us the dauphin's mind
first ambassador thus then in few
 your highness lately sending into france
 did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
 of your great predecessor king edward the third
 in answer of which claim the prince our master
 says that you savour too much of your youth
 and bids you be advised there's nought in france
 that can be with a nimble galliard won
 you cannot revel into dukedoms there
 he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
 this tun of treasure and in lieu of this
 desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
 hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks
king henry v what treasure uncle
exeter tennisballs my liege
king henry v we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us
 his present and your pains we thank you for
 when we have march'd our rackets to these balls
 we will in france by god's grace play a set
 shall strike his father's crown into the hazard
 tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
 that all the courts of france will be disturb'd
 with chaces and we understand him well
 how he comes o'er us with our wilder days
 not measuring what use we made of them
 we never valued this poor seat of england
 and therefore living hence did give ourself
 to barbarous licence as tis ever common
 that men are merriest when they are from home
 but tell the dauphin i will keep my state
 be like a king and show my sail of greatness
 when i do rouse me in my throne of france
 for that i have laid by my majesty
 and plodded like a man for workingdays
 but i will rise there with so full a glory
 that i will dazzle all the eyes of france
 yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us
 and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
 hath turn'd his balls to gunstones and his soul
 shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
 that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
 shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
 mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
 and some are yet ungotten and unborn
 that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn
 but this lies all within the will of god
 to whom i do appeal and in whose name
 tell you the dauphin i am coming on
 to venge me as i may and to put forth
 my rightful hand in a wellhallow'd cause
 so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin
 his jest will savour but of shallow wit
 when thousands weep more than did laugh at it
 convey them with safe conduct fare you well
 exeunt ambassadors
exeter this was a merry message
king henry v we hope to make the sender blush at it
 therefore my lords omit no happy hour
 that may give furtherance to our expedition
 for we have now no thought in us but france
 save those to god that run before our business
 therefore let our proportions for these wars
 be soon collected and all things thought upon
 that may with reasonable swiftness add
 more feathers to our wings for god before
 we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door
 therefore let every man now task his thought
 that this fair action may on foot be brought
 exeunt flourish

 enter chorus
chorus now all the youth of england are on fire
 and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
 now thrive the armourers and honour's thought
 reigns solely in the breast of every man
 they sell the pasture now to buy the horse
 following the mirror of all christian kings
 with winged heels as english mercuries
 for now sits expectation in the air
 and hides a sword from hilts unto the point
 with crowns imperial crowns and coronets
 promised to harry and his followers
 the french advised by good intelligence
 of this most dreadful preparation
 shake in their fear and with pale policy
 seek to divert the english purposes
 o england model to thy inward greatness
 like little body with a mighty heart
 what mightst thou do that honour would thee do
 were all thy children kind and natural
 but see thy fault france hath in thee found out
 a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
 with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
 one richard earl of cambridge and the second
 henry lord scroop of masham and the third
 sir thomas grey knight of northumberland
 have for the gilt of franceo guilt indeed
 confirm'd conspiracy with fearful france
 and by their hands this grace of kings must die
 if hell and treason hold their promises
 ere he take ship for france and in southampton
 linger your patience on and we'll digest
 the abuse of distance force a play
 the sum is paid the traitors are agreed
 the king is set from london and the scene
 is now transported gentles to southampton
 there is the playhouse now there must you sit
 and thence to france shall we convey you safe
 and bring you back charming the narrow seas
 to give you gentle pass for if we may
 we'll not offend one stomach with our play

 unto southampton do we shift our scene

 as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
 crowned with faith and constant loyalty
bedford the king hath note of all that they intend
 by interception which they dream not of

 whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours
 that he should for a foreign purse so sell
 his sovereign's life to death and treachery
 trumpets sound enter king henry v scroop
 cambridge grey and attendants
king henry v now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
 my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham
 and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
 think you not that the powers we bear with us
 will cut their passage through the force of france
 doing the execution and the act
 for which we have in head assembled them
scroop no doubt my liege if each man do his best
king henry v i doubt not that since we are well persuaded
 we carry not a heart with us from hence
 that grows not in a fair consent with ours
 nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
 success and conquest to attend on us
cambridge never was monarch better fear'd and loved
 than is your majesty there's not i think a subject
 that sits in heartgrief and uneasiness
 under the sweet shade of your government
grey true those that were your father's enemies
 have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
 with hearts create of duty and of zeal
king henry v we therefore have great cause of thankfulness
 and shall forget the office of our hand
 sooner than quittance of desert and merit
 according to the weight and worthiness
scroop so service shall with steeled sinews toil
 and labour shall refresh itself with hope
 to do your grace incessant services
king henry v we judge no less uncle of exeter
 enlarge the man committed yesterday
 that rail'd against our person we consider
 it was excess of wine that set him on
 and on his more advice we pardon him
scroop that's mercy but too much security
 let him be punish'd sovereign lest example
 breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
king henry v o let us yet be merciful
cambridge so may your highness and yet punish too
grey sir
 you show great mercy if you give him life
 after the taste of much correction
king henry v alas your too much love and care of me
 are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
 if little faults proceeding on distemper
 shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye
 when capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested
 appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man
 though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care
 and tender preservation of our person
 would have him punished and now to our french causes
 who are the late commissioners
cambridge i one my lord
 your highness bade me ask for it today
scroop so did you me my liege
grey and i my royal sovereign
king henry v then richard earl of cambridge there is yours
 there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight
 grey of northumberland this same is yours
 read them and know i know your worthiness
 my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter
 we will aboard to night why how now gentlemen
 what see you in those papers that you lose
 so much complexion look ye how they change
 their cheeks are paper why what read you there
 that hath so cowarded and chased your blood
 out of appearance
cambridge i do confess my fault
 and do submit me to your highness mercy
grey 
 to which we all appeal
scroop 
king henry v the mercy that was quick in us but late
 by your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd
 you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
 for your own reasons turn into your bosoms
 as dogs upon their masters worrying you
 see you my princes and my noble peers
 these english monsters my lord of cambridge here
 you know how apt our love was to accord
 to furnish him with all appertinents
 belonging to his honour and this man
 hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired
 and sworn unto the practises of france
 to kill us here in hampton to the which
 this knight no less for bounty bound to us
 than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o
 what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel
 ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
 thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
 that knew'st the very bottom of my soul
 that almost mightst have coin'd me into gold
 wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use
 may it be possible that foreign hire
 could out of thee extract one spark of evil
 that might annoy my finger tis so strange
 that though the truth of it stands off as gross
 as black and white my eye will scarcely see it
 treason and murder ever kept together
 as two yokedevils sworn to either's purpose
 working so grossly in a natural cause
 that admiration did not whoop at them
 but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
 wonder to wait on treason and on murder
 and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
 that wrought upon thee so preposterously
 hath got the voice in hell for excellence
 all other devils that suggest by treasons
 do botch and bungle up damnation
 with patches colours and with forms being fetch'd
 from glistering semblances of piety
 but he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up
 gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
 unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
 if that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
 should with his lion gait walk the whole world
 he might return to vasty tartar back
 and tell the legions i can never win
 a soul so easy as that englishman's'
 o how hast thou with jealousy infected
 the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful
 why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
 why so didst thou come they of noble family
 why so didst thou seem they religious
 why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
 free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
 constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
 garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement
 not working with the eye without the ear
 and but in purged judgment trusting neither
 such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
 and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
 to mark the fullfraught man and best indued
 with some suspicion i will weep for thee
 for this revolt of thine methinks is like
 another fall of man their faults are open
 arrest them to the answer of the law
 and god acquit them of their practises
exeter i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 richard earl of cambridge
 i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 henry lord scroop of masham
 i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 thomas grey knight of northumberland
scroop our purposes god justly hath discover'd
 and i repent my fault more than my death
 which i beseech your highness to forgive
 although my body pay the price of it
cambridge for me the gold of france did not seduce
 although i did admit it as a motive
 the sooner to effect what i intended
 but god be thanked for prevention
 which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice
 beseeching god and you to pardon me
grey never did faithful subject more rejoice
 at the discovery of most dangerous treason
 than i do at this hour joy o'er myself
 prevented from a damned enterprise
 my fault but not my body pardon sovereign
king henry v god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence
 you have conspired against our royal person
 join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
 received the golden earnest of our death
 wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
 his princes and his peers to servitude
 his subjects to oppression and contempt
 and his whole kingdom into desolation
 touching our person seek we no revenge
 but we our kingdom's safety must so tender
 whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
 we do deliver you get you therefore hence
 poor miserable wretches to your death
 the taste whereof god of his mercy give
 you patience to endure and true repentance
 of all your dear offences bear them hence
 exeunt cambridge scroop and grey guarded
 now lords for france the enterprise whereof
 shall be to you as us like glorious
 we doubt not of a fair and lucky war
 since god so graciously hath brought to light
 this dangerous treason lurking in our way
 to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
 but every rub is smoothed on our way
 then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
 our puissance into the hand of god
 putting it straight in expedition
 cheerly to sea the signs of war advance

scene iv france the king's palace
 flourish enter the french king the dauphin the
 dukes of berri and bretagne the constable and others
king of france thus comes the english with full power upon us
 and more than carefully it us concerns
 to answer royally in our defences
 therefore the dukes of berri and of bretagne
 of brabant and of orleans shall make forth
 and you prince dauphin with all swift dispatch
 to line and new repair our towns of war
 with men of courage and with means defendant
 for england his approaches makes as fierce
 as waters to the sucking of a gulf
 it fits us then to be as provident
 as fear may teach us out of late examples
 left by the fatal and neglected english
 upon our fields
dauphin my most redoubted father
 it is most meet we arm us gainst the foe
 for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
 though war nor no known quarrel were in question
 but that defences musters preparations
 should be maintain'd assembled and collected
 as were a war in expectation
 therefore i say tis meet we all go forth
 to view the sick and feeble parts of france
 and let us do it with no show of fear
 no with no more than if we heard that england
 were busied with a whitsun morrisdance
 for my good liege she is so idly king'd
 her sceptre so fantastically borne
 by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
 that fear attends her not
constable o peace prince dauphin
 you are too much mistaken in this king
 question your grace the late ambassadors
 with what great state he heard their embassy
 how well supplied with noble counsellors
 how modest in exception and withal
 how terrible in constant resolution
 and you shall find his vanities forespent
 were but the outside of the roman brutus
 covering discretion with a coat of folly
 as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
 that shall first spring and be most delicate
dauphin well tis not so my lord high constable
 but though we think it so it is no matter
 in cases of defence tis best to weigh
 the enemy more mighty than he seems
 so the proportions of defence are fill'd
 which of a weak or niggardly projection
 doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
 a little cloth
king of france think we king harry strong
 and princes look you strongly arm to meet him
 the kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us
 and he is bred out of that bloody strain
 that haunted us in our familiar paths
 witness our too much memorable shame
 when cressy battle fatally was struck
 and all our princes captiv'd by the hand
 of that black name edward black prince of wales
 whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
 up in the air crown'd with the golden sun
 saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him
 mangle the work of nature and deface
 the patterns that by god and by french fathers
 had twenty years been made this is a stem
 of that victorious stock and let us fear
 the native mightiness and fate of him
 enter a messenger
messenger ambassadors from harry king of england
 do crave admittance to your majesty
king of france we'll give them present audience go and bring them
 exeunt messenger and certain lords
 you see this chase is hotly follow'd friends
dauphin turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
 most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
 runs far before them good my sovereign
 take up the english short and let them know
 of what a monarchy you are the head
 selflove my liege is not so vile a sin
 as selfneglecting
 reenter lords with exeter and train
king of france from our brother england
exeter from him and thus he greets your majesty
 he wills you in the name of god almighty
 that you divest yourself and lay apart
 the borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven
 by law of nature and of nations long
 to him and to his heirs namely the crown
 and all widestretched honours that pertain
 by custom and the ordinance of times
 unto the crown of france that you may know
 tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
 pick'd from the wormholes of longvanish'd days
 nor from the dust of old oblivion raked
 he sends you this most memorable line
 in every branch truly demonstrative
 willing to overlook this pedigree
 and when you find him evenly derived
 from his most famed of famous ancestors
 edward the third he bids you then resign
 your crown and kingdom indirectly held
 from him the native and true challenger
king of france or else what follows
exeter bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
 even in your hearts there will he rake for it
 therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
 in thunder and in earthquake like a jove
 that if requiring fail he will compel
 and bids you in the bowels of the lord
 deliver up the crown and to take mercy
 on the poor souls for whom this hungry war
 opens his vasty jaws and on your head
 turning the widows tears the orphans cries
 the dead men's blood the pining maidens groans
 for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
 that shall be swallow'd in this controversy
 this is his claim his threatening and my message
 unless the dauphin be in presence here
 to whom expressly i bring greeting too
king of france for us we will consider of this further
 tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
 back to our brother england
dauphin for the dauphin
 i stand here for him what to him from england
exeter scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
 and any thing that may not misbecome
 the mighty sender doth he prize you at
 thus says my king an if your father's highness
 do not in grant of all demands at large
 sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty
 he'll call you to so hot an answer of it
 that caves and womby vaultages of france
 shall chide your trespass and return your mock
 in second accent of his ordnance
dauphin say if my father render fair return
 it is against my will for i desire
 nothing but odds with england to that end
 as matching to his youth and vanity
 i did present him with the paris balls
exeter he'll make your paris louvre shake for it
 were it the mistresscourt of mighty europe
 and be assured you'll find a difference
 as we his subjects have in wonder found
 between the promise of his greener days
 and these he masters now now he weighs time
 even to the utmost grain that you shall read
 in your own losses if he stay in france
king of france tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
exeter dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
 come here himself to question our delay
 for he is footed in this land already
king of france you shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions
 a night is but small breath and little pause
 to answer matters of this consequence

chorus thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
 in motion of no less celerity
 than that of thought suppose that you have seen
 the wellappointed king at hampton pier
 embark his royalty and his brave fleet
 with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning
 play with your fancies and in them behold
 upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing
 hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
 to sounds confused behold the threaden sails
 borne with the invisible and creeping wind
 draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea
 breasting the lofty surge o do but think
 you stand upon the ravage and behold
 a city on the inconstant billows dancing
 for so appears this fleet majestical
 holding due course to harfleur follow follow
 grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
 and leave your england as dead midnight still
 guarded with grandsires babies and old women
 either past or not arrived to pith and puissance
 for who is he whose chin is but enrich'd
 with one appearing hair that will not follow
 these cull'd and choicedrawn cavaliers to france
 work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
 behold the ordnance on their carriages
 with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur
 suppose the ambassador from the french comes back
 tells harry that the king doth offer him
 katharine his daughter and with her to dowry
 some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
 the offer likes not and the nimble gunner

 and teach them how to war and you good yeoman
 whose limbs were made in england show us here

 exeunt all but boy
boy as young as i am i have observed these three
 swashers i am boy to them all three but all they
 three though they would serve me could not be man
 to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to
 a man for bardolph he is whitelivered and
 redfaced by the means whereof a faces it out but
 fights not for pistol he hath a killing tongue
 and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks
 words and keeps whole weapons for nym he hath
 heard that men of few words are the best men and
 therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a'
 should be thought a coward but his few bad words
 are matched with as few good deeds for a never
 broke any man's head but his own and that was
 against a post when he was drunk they will steal
 any thing and call it purchase bardolph stole a
 lutecase bore it twelve leagues and sold it for
 three half pence nym and bardolph are sworn
 brothers in filching and in calais they stole a
 fireshovel i knew by that piece of service the
 men would carry coals they would have me as
 familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
 handkerchers which makes much against my manhood
 if i should take from another's pocket to put into
 mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs i
 must leave them and seek some better service
 their villany goes against my weak stomach and
 therefore i must cast it up

 what rein can hold licentious wickedness
 when down the hill he holds his fierce career
 we may as bootless spend our vain command

 take pity of your town and of your people
 whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
 whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
 o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
 of heady murder spoil and villany
 if not why in a moment look to see
 the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
 defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters
 your fathers taken by the silver beards
 and their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls
 your naked infants spitted upon pikes
 whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
 do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry
 at herod's bloodyhunting slaughtermen

 heart and my duty and my life and my living and
 my uttermost power he is notgod be praised and
 blessedany hurt in the world but keeps the
 bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline
 there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
 pridge i think in my very conscience he is as
 valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no
 estimation in the world but did see him do as
 gallant service
gower what do you call him
fluellen he is called aunchient pistol
gower i know him not
 enter pistol
fluellen here is the man
pistol captain i thee beseech to do me favours
 the duke of exeter doth love thee well
fluellen ay i praise god and i have merited some love at
 his hands
pistol bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
 and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
 and giddy fortune's furious fickle wheel
 that goddess blind
 that stands upon the rolling restless stone
fluellen by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is
 painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to
 signify to you that fortune is blind and she is
 painted also with a wheel to signify to you which
 is the moral of it that she is turning and
 inconstant and mutability and variation and her
 foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone
 which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth
 the poet makes a most excellent description of it
 fortune is an excellent moral
pistol fortune is bardolph's foe and frowns on him
 for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be
 a damned death
 let gallows gape for dog let man go free
 and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
 but exeter hath given the doom of death
 for pax of little price
 therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice
 and let not bardolph's vital thread be cut
 with edge of penny cord and vile reproach
 speak captain for his life and i will thee requite
fluellen aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning
pistol why then rejoice therefore
fluellen certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice
 at for if look you he were my brother i would
 desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put
 him to execution for discipline ought to be used
pistol die and be damn'd and figo for thy friendship
fluellen it is well
pistol the fig of spain
 exit
fluellen very good
gower why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i
 remember him now a bawd a cutpurse
fluellen i'll assure you a uttered as brave words at the
 bridge as you shall see in a summer's day but it
 is very well what he has spoke to me that is well
 i warrant you when time is serve
gower why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then
 goes to the wars to grace himself at his return
 into london under the form of a soldier and such
 fellows are perfect in the great commanders names
 and they will learn you by rote where services were
 done at such and such a sconce at such a breach
 at such a convoy who came off bravely who was
 shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on
 and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war
 which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what
 a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
 the camp will do among foaming bottles and
 alewashed wits is wonderful to be thought on but
 you must learn to know such slanders of the age or
 else you may be marvellously mistook
fluellen i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is
 not the man that he would gladly make show to the
 world he is if i find a hole in his coat i will
 tell him my mind
 drum heard
 hark you the king is coming and i must speak with
 him from the pridge
 drum and colours enter king henry gloucester and soldiers
 god pless your majesty
king henry v how now fluellen camest thou from the bridge
fluellen ay so please your majesty the duke of exeter has
 very gallantly maintained the pridge the french is
 gone off look you and there is gallant and most
 prave passages marry th athversary was have
 possession of the pridge but he is enforced to
 retire and the duke of exeter is master of the
 pridge i can tell your majesty the duke is a
 prave man
king henry v what men have you lost fluellen
fluellen the perdition of th athversary hath been very
 great reasonable great marry for my part i
 think the duke hath lost never a man but one that
 is like to be executed for robbing a church one
 bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is
 all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o'
 fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like
 a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red
 but his nose is executed and his fire's out
king henry v we would have all such offenders so cut off and we
 give express charge that in our marches through the
 country there be nothing compelled from the
 villages nothing taken but paid for none of the
 french upbraided or abused in disdainful language
 for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
 gentler gamester is the soonest winner
 tucket enter montjoy
montjoy you know me by my habit
king henry v well then i know thee what shall i know of thee
montjoy my master's mind
king henry v unfold it
montjoy thus says my king say thou to harry of england
 though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage
 is a better soldier than rashness tell him we
 could have rebuked him at harfleur but that we
 thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
 full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice
 is imperial england shall repent his folly see
 his weakness and admire our sufferance bid him
 therefore consider of his ransom which must
 proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we
 have lost the disgrace we have digested which in
 weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under
 for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the
 effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too
 faint a number and for our disgrace his own
 person kneeling at our feet but a weak and
 worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and
 tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
 followers whose condemnation is pronounced so far
 my king and master so much my office
king henry v what is thy name i know thy quality
montjoy montjoy
king henry v thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back
 and tell thy king i do not seek him now
 but could be willing to march on to calais
 without impeachment for to say the sooth
 though tis no wisdom to confess so much
 unto an enemy of craft and vantage
 my people are with sickness much enfeebled
 my numbers lessened and those few i have
 almost no better than so many french
 who when they were in health i tell thee herald
 i thought upon one pair of english legs
 did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god
 that i do brag thus this your air of france
 hath blown that vice in me i must repent
 go therefore tell thy master here i am
 my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
 my army but a weak and sickly guard
 yet god before tell him we will come on
 though france himself and such another neighbour
 stand in our way there's for thy labour montjoy
 go bid thy master well advise himself
 if we may pass we will if we be hinder'd
 we shall your tawny ground with your red blood
 discolour and so montjoy fare you well
 the sum of all our answer is but this
 we would not seek a battle as we are
 nor as we are we say we will not shun it
 so tell your master
montjoy i shall deliver so thanks to your highness
 exit
gloucester i hope they will not come upon us now
king henry v we are in god's hand brother not in theirs
 march to the bridge it now draws toward night
 beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves
 and on tomorrow bid them march away

scene vii the french camp near agincourt
 enter the constable of france the lord rambures
 orleans dauphin with others
constable tut i have the best armour of the world would it were day
orleans you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due
constable it is the best horse of europe
orleans will it never be morning
dauphin my lord of orleans and my lord high constable you
 talk of horse and armour
orleans you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world
dauphin what a long night is this i will not change my
 horse with any that treads but on four pasterns
 ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his
 entrails were hairs le cheval volant the pegasus
 chez les narines de feu when i bestride him i
 soar i am a hawk he trots the air the earth
 sings when he touches it the basest horn of his
 hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes
orleans he's of the colour of the nutmeg
dauphin and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for
 perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull
 elements of earth and water never appear in him but
 only in patient stillness while his rider mounts
 him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
 may call beasts
constable indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse
dauphin it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
 bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
orleans no more cousin
dauphin nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the
 rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary
 deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as
 fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent
 tongues and my horse is argument for them all
 tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for
 a sovereign's sovereign to ride on and for the
 world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
 their particular functions and wonder at him i
 once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus
 wonder of nature'
orleans i have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress
dauphin then did they imitate that which i composed to my
 courser for my horse is my mistress
orleans your mistress bears well
dauphin me well which is the prescript praise and
 perfection of a good and particular mistress
constable nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
 shook your back
dauphin so perhaps did yours
constable mine was not bridled
dauphin o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode
 like a kern of ireland your french hose off and in
 your straight strossers
constable you have good judgment in horsemanship
dauphin be warned by me then they that ride so and ride
 not warily fall into foul bogs i had rather have
 my horse to my mistress
constable i had as lief have my mistress a jade
dauphin i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair
constable i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow
 to my mistress
dauphin le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et
 la truie lavee au bourbier thou makest use of any thing
constable yet do i not use my horse for my mistress or any
 such proverb so little kin to the purpose
rambures my lord constable the armour that i saw in your tent
 tonight are those stars or suns upon it
constable stars my lord
dauphin some of them will fall tomorrow i hope
constable and yet my sky shall not want
dauphin that may be for you bear a many superfluously and
 twere more honour some were away
constable even as your horse bears your praises who would
 trot as well were some of your brags dismounted
dauphin would i were able to load him with his desert will
 it never be day i will trot tomorrow a mile and
 my way shall be paved with english faces
constable i will not say so for fear i should be faced out of
 my way but i would it were morning for i would
 fain be about the ears of the english
rambures who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
constable you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them
dauphin tis midnight i'll go arm myself
 exit
orleans the dauphin longs for morning
rambures he longs to eat the english
constable i think he will eat all he kills
orleans by the white hand of my lady he's a gallant prince
constable swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
orleans he is simply the most active gentleman of france
constable doing is activity and he will still be doing
orleans he never did harm that i heard of
constable nor will do none tomorrow he will keep that good name still
orleans i know him to be valiant
constable i was told that by one that knows him better than
 you
orleans what's he
constable marry he told me so himself and he said he cared
 not who knew it
orleans he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
constable by my faith sir but it is never any body saw it
 but his lackey tis a hooded valour and when it
 appears it will bate
orleans ill will never said well
constable i will cap that proverb with there is flattery in friendship'
orleans and i will take up that with give the devil his due'
constable well placed there stands your friend for the
 devil have at the very eye of that proverb with a
 pox of the devil'
orleans you are the better at proverbs by how much a
 fool's bolt is soon shot'
constable you have shot over
orleans tis not the first time you were overshot
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord high constable the english lie within
 fifteen hundred paces of your tents
constable who hath measured the ground
messenger the lord grandpre
constable a valiant and most expert gentleman would it were
 day alas poor harry of england he longs not for
 the dawning as we do
orleans what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
 england to mope with his fatbrained followers so
 far out of his knowledge
constable if the english had any apprehension they would run away
orleans that they lack for if their heads had any
 intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy
 headpieces
rambures that island of england breeds very valiant
 creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
orleans foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a
 russian bear and have their heads crushed like
 rotten apples you may as well say that's a
 valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion
constable just just and the men do sympathize with the
 mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving
 their wits with their wives and then give them
 great meals of beef and iron and steel they will
 eat like wolves and fight like devils
orleans ay but these english are shrewdly out of beef
constable then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs
 to eat and none to fight now is it time to arm
 come shall we about it
orleans it is now two o'clock but let me see by ten
 we shall have each a hundred englishmen

act iv
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus now entertain conjecture of a time
 when creeping murmur and the poring dark
 fills the wide vessel of the universe
 from camp to camp through the foul womb of night
 the hum of either army stilly sounds
 that the fixed sentinels almost receive
 the secret whispers of each other's watch
 fire answers fire and through their paly flames
 each battle sees the other's umber'd face
 steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
 piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents
 the armourers accomplishing the knights
 with busy hammers closing rivets up
 give dreadful note of preparation
 the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll
 and the third hour of drowsy morning name
 proud of their numbers and secure in soul
 the confident and overlusty french
 do the lowrated english play at dice
 and chide the cripple tardygaited night
 who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
 so tediously away the poor condemned english
 like sacrifices by their watchful fires
 sit patiently and inly ruminate
 the morning's danger and their gesture sad
 investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats
 presenteth them unto the gazing moon
 so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold
 the royal captain of this ruin'd band
 walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
 let him cry praise and glory on his head'
 for forth he goes and visits all his host
 bids them good morrow with a modest smile
 and calls them brothers friends and countrymen
 upon his royal face there is no note
 how dread an army hath enrounded him
 nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
 unto the weary and allwatched night
 but freshly looks and overbears attaint
 with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
 that every wretch pining and pale before
 beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
 a largess universal like the sun
 his liberal eye doth give to every one
 thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
 behold as may unworthiness define
 a little touch of harry in the night
 and so our scene must to the battle fly
 whereo for pitywe shall much disgrace
 with four or five most vile and ragged foils
 right illdisposed in brawl ridiculous
 the name of agincourt yet sit and see
 minding true things by what their mockeries be
 exit

act iv
scene i the english camp at agincourt
 enter king henry bedford and gloucester
king henry v gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
 the greater therefore should our courage be
 good morrow brother bedford god almighty
 there is some soul of goodness in things evil
 would men observingly distil it out
 for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
 which is both healthful and good husbandry
 besides they are our outward consciences
 and preachers to us all admonishing
 that we should dress us fairly for our end
 thus may we gather honey from the weed
 and make a moral of the devil himself
 enter erpingham
 good morrow old sir thomas erpingham
 a good soft pillow for that good white head
 were better than a churlish turf of france
erpingham not so my liege this lodging likes me better
 since i may say now lie i like a king'
king henry v tis good for men to love their present pains
 upon example so the spirit is eased
 and when the mind is quicken'd out of doubt
 the organs though defunct and dead before
 break up their drowsy grave and newly move
 with casted slough and fresh legerity
 lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both
 commend me to the princes in our camp
 do my good morrow to them and anon
 desire them an to my pavilion

erpingham shall i attend your grace

king henry v it sorts well with your fierceness
 enter fluellen and gower
gower captain fluellen
fluellen so in the name of jesu christ speak lower it is
 the greatest admiration of the universal world when
 the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
 wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to
 examine the wars of pompey the great you shall
 find i warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle
 nor pibble pabble in pompey's camp i warrant you
 you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the
 cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety
 of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
fluellen if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
 coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also
 look you be an ass and a fool and a prating
 coxcomb in your own conscience now
gower i will speak lower
fluellen i pray you and beseech you that you will
 exeunt gower and fluellen
king henry v though it appear a little out of fashion
 there is much care and valour in this welshman
 enter three soldiers john bates alexander court
 and michael williams
court brother john bates is not that the morning which
 breaks yonder
bates i think it be but we have no great cause to desire
 the approach of day
williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think
 we shall never see the end of it who goes there
king henry v a friend
williams under what captain serve you
king henry v under sir thomas erpingham
williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i
 pray you what thinks he of our estate
king henry v even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be
 washed off the next tide
bates he hath not told his thought to the king
king henry v no nor it is not meet he should for though i
 speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i
 am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the
 element shows to him as it doth to me all his
 senses have but human conditions his ceremonies
 laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and
 though his affections are higher mounted than ours
 yet when they stoop they stoop with the like
 wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we
 do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
 as ours are yet in reason no man should possess
 him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing
 it should dishearten his army
bates he may show what outward courage he will but i
 believe as cold a night as tis he could wish
 himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he
 were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here
king henry v by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king
 i think he would not wish himself any where but
 where he is
bates then i would he were here alone so should he be
 sure to be ransomed and a many poor men's lives saved
king henry v i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
 alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
 minds methinks i could not die any where so
 contented as in the king's company his cause being
 just and his quarrel honourable
williams that's more than we know
bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know
 enough if we know we are the kings subjects if
 his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes
 the crime of it out of us
williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath
 a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and
 arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join
 together at the latter day and cry all we died at
 such a place some swearing some crying for a
 surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind
 them some upon the debts they owe some upon their
 children rawly left i am afeard there are few die
 well that die in a battle for how can they
 charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their
 argument now if these men do not die well it
 will be a black matter for the king that led them to
 it whom to disobey were against all proportion of
 subjection
king henry v so if a son that is by his father sent about
 merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the
 imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be
 imposed upon his father that sent him or if a
 servant under his master's command transporting a
 sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
 many irreconciled iniquities you may call the
 business of the master the author of the servant's
 damnation but this is not so the king is not
 bound to answer the particular endings of his
 soldiers the father of his son nor the master of
 his servant for they purpose not their death when
 they purpose their services besides there is no
 king be his cause never so spotless if it come to
 the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all
 unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them
 the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder
 some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
 perjury some making the wars their bulwark that
 have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
 pillage and robbery now if these men have
 defeated the law and outrun native punishment
 though they can outstrip men they have no wings to
 fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance
 so that here men are punished for beforebreach of
 the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where
 they feared the death they have borne life away
 and where they would be safe they perish then if
 they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of
 their damnation than he was before guilty of those
 impieties for the which they are now visited every
 subject's duty is the king's but every subject's
 soul is his own therefore should every soldier in
 the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every
 mote out of his conscience and dying so death
 is to him advantage or not dying the time was
 blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained
 and in him that escapes it were not sin to think
 that making god so free an offer he let him
 outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach
 others how they should prepare
williams tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon
 his own head the king is not to answer it
bates but i do not desire he should answer for me and
 yet i determine to fight lustily for him
king henry v i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed
williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but
 when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we
 ne'er the wiser
king henry v if i live to see it i will never trust his word after
williams you pay him then that's a perilous shot out of an
 eldergun that a poor and private displeasure can
 do against a monarch you may as well go about to
 turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
 peacock's feather you'll never trust his word
 after come tis a foolish saying
king henry v your reproof is something too round i should be
 angry with you if the time were convenient
williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live
king henry v i embrace it
williams how shall i know thee again
king henry v give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my
 bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it i
 will make it my quarrel
williams here's my glove give me another of thine
king henry v there
williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come
 to me and say after tomorrow this is my glove'
 by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear
king henry v if ever i live to see it i will challenge it
williams thou darest as well be hanged
king henry v well i will do it though i take thee in the
 king's company
williams keep thy word fare thee well
bates be friends you english fools be friends we have
 french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
king henry v indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to
 one they will beat us for they bear them on their
 shoulders but it is no english treason to cut
 french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will
 be a clipper
 exeunt soldiers
 upon the king let us our lives our souls
 our debts our careful wives
 our children and our sins lay on the king
 we must bear all o hard condition
 twinborn with greatness subject to the breath
 of every fool whose sense no more can feel
 but his own wringing what infinite heart'sease
 must kings neglect that private men enjoy
 and what have kings that privates have not too
 save ceremony save general ceremony
 and what art thou thou idle ceremony
 what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more
 of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
 what are thy rents what are thy comings in
 o ceremony show me but thy worth
 what is thy soul of adoration
 art thou aught else but place degree and form
 creating awe and fear in other men
 wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
 than they in fearing
 what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet
 but poison'd flattery o be sick great greatness
 and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
 think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
 with titles blown from adulation
 will it give place to flexure and low bending
 canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee
 command the health of it no thou proud dream
 that play'st so subtly with a king's repose
 i am a king that find thee and i know
 tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
 the sword the mace the crown imperial
 the intertissued robe of gold and pearl
 the farced title running fore the king
 the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
 that beats upon the high shore of this world
 no not all these thricegorgeous ceremony
 not all these laid in bed majestical
 can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
 who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
 gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread
 never sees horrid night the child of hell
 but like a lackey from the rise to set
 sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night
 sleeps in elysium next day after dawn
 doth rise and help hyperion to his horse
 and follows so the everrunning year
 with profitable labour to his grave
 and but for ceremony such a wretch
 winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
 had the forehand and vantage of a king
 the slave a member of the country's peace
 enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
 what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
 whose hours the peasant best advantages

messenger the english are embattled you french peers
constable to horse you gallant princes straight to horse

 the vapour of our valour will o'erturn them
 tis positive gainst all exceptions lords

 a very little little let us do
 and all is done then let the trumpets sound
 the tucket sonance and the note to mount
 for our approach shall so much dare the field
 that england shall couch down in fear and yield
 enter grandpre
grandpre why do you stay so long my lords of france
 yon island carrions desperate of their bones
 illfavouredly become the morning field
 their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
 and our air shakes them passing scornfully
 big mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
 and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
 the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
 with torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades
 lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
 the gum downroping from their paledead eyes
 and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
 lies foul with chew'd grass still and motionless
 and their executors the knavish crows
 fly o'er them all impatient for their hour
 description cannot suit itself in words
 to demonstrate the life of such a battle
 in life so lifeless as it shows itself
constable they have said their prayers and they stay for death
dauphin shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
 and give their fasting horses provender
 and after fight with them
constable i stay but for my guidon to the field
 i will the banner from a trumpet take
 and use it for my haste come come away
 the sun is high and we outwear the day

scene iii the english camp
 enter gloucester bedford exeter erpingham with
 all his host salisbury and westmoreland
gloucester where is the king
bedford the king himself is rode to view their battle
westmoreland of fighting men they have full three score thousand
exeter there's five to one besides they all are fresh
salisbury god's arm strike with us tis a fearful odds
 god be wi you princes all i'll to my charge
 if we no more meet till we meet in heaven
 then joyfully my noble lord of bedford
 my dear lord gloucester and my good lord exeter
 and my kind kinsman warriors all adieu
bedford farewell good salisbury and good luck go with thee
exeter farewell kind lord fight valiantly today
 and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it
 for thou art framed of the firm truth of valour
 exit salisbury
bedford he is full of valour as of kindness
 princely in both
 enter the king
westmoreland o that we now had here
 but one ten thousand of those men in england
 that do no work today
king henry v what's he that wishes so
 my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin
 if we are mark'd to die we are enow
 to do our country loss and if to live
 the fewer men the greater share of honour
 god's will i pray thee wish not one man more
 by jove i am not covetous for gold
 nor care i who doth feed upon my cost
 it yearns me not if men my garments wear
 such outward things dwell not in my desires
 but if it be a sin to covet honour
 i am the most offending soul alive
 no faith my coz wish not a man from england
 god's peace i would not lose so great an honour
 as one man more methinks would share from me
 for the best hope i have o do not wish one more
 rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host
 that he which hath no stomach to this fight
 let him depart his passport shall be made
 and crowns for convoy put into his purse
 we would not die in that man's company
 that fears his fellowship to die with us
 this day is called the feast of crispian
 he that outlives this day and comes safe home
 will stand a tiptoe when the day is named
 and rouse him at the name of crispian
 he that shall live this day and see old age
 will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
 and say tomorrow is saint crispian'
 then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
 and say these wounds i had on crispin's day'
 old men forget yet all shall be forgot
 but he'll remember with advantages
 what feats he did that day then shall our names
 familiar in his mouth as household words
 harry the king bedford and exeter
 warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester
 be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd
 this story shall the good man teach his son
 and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by
 from this day to the ending of the world
 but we in it shall be remember'd
 we few we happy few we band of brothers
 for he today that sheds his blood with me
 shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile
 this day shall gentle his condition
 and gentlemen in england now abed
 shall think themselves accursed they were not here
 and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
 that fought with us upon saint crispin's day
 reenter salisbury
salisbury my sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
 the french are bravely in their battles set
 and will with all expedience charge on us
king henry v all things are ready if our minds be so
westmoreland perish the man whose mind is backward now
king henry v thou dost not wish more help from england coz
westmoreland god's will my liege would you and i alone
 without more help could fight this royal battle
king henry v why now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men
 which likes me better than to wish us one
 you know your places god be with you all
 tucket enter montjoy
montjoy once more i come to know of thee king harry
 if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
 before thy most assured overthrow
 for certainly thou art so near the gulf
 thou needs must be englutted besides in mercy
 the constable desires thee thou wilt mind
 thy followers of repentance that their souls
 may make a peaceful and a sweet retire
 from off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
 must lie and fester
king henry v who hath sent thee now
montjoy the constable of france
king henry v i pray thee bear my former answer back
 bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
 good god why should they mock poor fellows thus
 the man that once did sell the lion's skin
 while the beast lived was killed with hunting him
 a many of our bodies shall no doubt
 find native graves upon the which i trust
 shall witness live in brass of this day's work
 and those that leave their valiant bones in france
 dying like men though buried in your dunghills
 they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them
 and draw their honours reeking up to heaven
 leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
 the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france
 mark then abounding valour in our english
 that being dead like to the bullet's grazing
 break out into a second course of mischief
 killing in relapse of mortality
 let me speak proudly tell the constable
 we are but warriors for the workingday
 our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
 with rainy marching in the painful field
 there's not a piece of feather in our host
 good argument i hope we will not fly
 and time hath worn us into slovenry
 but by the mass our hearts are in the trim
 and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
 they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
 the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers heads
 and turn them out of service if they do this
 as if god please they shallmy ransom then
 will soon be levied herald save thou thy labour
 come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
 they shall have none i swear but these my joints
 which if they have as i will leave em them
 shall yield them little tell the constable
montjoy i shall king harry and so fare thee well
 thou never shalt hear herald any more
 exit
king henry v i fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom

 my soul shall thine keep company to heaven

 we kept together in our chivalry'
 upon these words i came and cheer'd him up
 he smiled me in the face raught me his hand

 commend my service to me sovereign'
 so did he turn and over suffolk's neck
 he threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips
 and so espoused to death with blood he seal'd

chorus vouchsafe to those that have not read the story

 i humbly pray them to admit the excuse
 of time of numbers and due course of things
 which cannot in their huge and proper life
 be here presented now we bear the king
 toward calais grant him there there seen
 heave him away upon your winged thoughts
 athwart the sea behold the english beach
 pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
 whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouth'd sea
 which like a mighty whiffler fore the king
 seems to prepare his way so let him land
 and solemnly see him set on to london
 so swift a pace hath thought that even now
 you may imagine him upon blackheath
 where that his lords desire him to have borne
 his bruised helmet and his bended sword
 before him through the city he forbids it
 being free from vainness and selfglorious pride
 giving full trophy signal and ostent
 quite from himself to god but now behold
 in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought
 how london doth pour out her citizens
 the mayor and all his brethren in best sort
 like to the senators of the antique rome
 with the plebeians swarming at their heels
 go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in
 as by a lower but loving likelihood
 were now the general of our gracious empress
 as in good time he may from ireland coming
 bringing rebellion broached on his sword
 how many would the peaceful city quit
 to welcome him much more and much more cause
 did they this harry now in london place him
 as yet the lamentation of the french
 invites the king of england's stay at home
 the emperor's coming in behalf of france
 to order peace between them and omit
 all the occurrences whatever chanced
 till harry's backreturn again to france
 there must we bring him and myself have play'd
 the interim by remembering you tis past

scene ii france a royal palace
 enter at one door king henry exeter bedford
 gloucester warwick westmoreland and other lords
 at another the french king queen isabel the
 princess katharine alice and other ladies the
 duke of burgundy and his train
king henry v peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
 unto our brother france and to our sister
 health and fair time of day joy and good wishes
 to our most fair and princely cousin katharine
 and as a branch and member of this royalty
 by whom this great assembly is contrived
 we do salute you duke of burgundy
 and princes french and peers health to you all
king of france right joyous are we to behold your face
 most worthy brother england fairly met
 so are you princes english every one
queen isabel so happy be the issue brother england
 of this good day and of this gracious meeting
 as we are now glad to behold your eyes
 your eyes which hitherto have borne in them
 against the french that met them in their bent
 the fatal balls of murdering basilisks
 the venom of such looks we fairly hope
 have lost their quality and that this day
 shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
king henry v to cry amen to that thus we appear
queen isabel you english princes all i do salute you
burgundy my duty to you both on equal love
 great kings of france and england that i have labour'd
 with all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
 to bring your most imperial majesties
 unto this bar and royal interview
 your mightiness on both parts best can witness
 since then my office hath so far prevail'd
 that face to face and royal eye to eye
 you have congreeted let it not disgrace me
 if i demand before this royal view
 what rub or what impediment there is
 why that the naked poor and mangled peace
 dear nurse of arts and joyful births
 should not in this best garden of the world
 our fertile france put up her lovely visage
 alas she hath from france too long been chased
 and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
 corrupting in its own fertility
 her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
 unpruned dies her hedges evenpleach'd
 like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
 put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas
 the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
 doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
 that should deracinate such savagery
 the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
 the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
 wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
 conceives by idleness and nothing teems
 but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
 losing both beauty and utility
 and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
 defective in their natures grow to wildness
 even so our houses and ourselves and children
 have lost or do not learn for want of time
 the sciences that should become our country
 but grow like savagesas soldiers will
 that nothing do but meditate on blood
 to swearing and stern looks diffused attire
 and every thing that seems unnatural
 which to reduce into our former favour
 you are assembled and my speech entreats
 that i may know the let why gentle peace
 should not expel these inconveniences
 and bless us with her former qualities
king henry v if duke of burgundy you would the peace
 whose want gives growth to the imperfections
 which you have cited you must buy that peace
 with full accord to all our just demands
 whose tenors and particular effects
 you have enscheduled briefly in your hands
burgundy the king hath heard them to the which as yet
 there is no answer made
king henry v well then the peace
 which you before so urged lies in his answer
king of france i have but with a cursorary eye
 o'erglanced the articles pleaseth your grace
 to appoint some of your council presently
 to sit with us once more with better heed
 to resurvey them we will suddenly
 pass our accept and peremptory answer
king henry v brother we shall go uncle exeter
 and brother clarence and you brother gloucester
 warwick and huntingdon go with the king
 and take with you free power to ratify
 augment or alter as your wisdoms best
 shall see advantageable for our dignity
 any thing in or out of our demands
 and we'll consign thereto will you fair sister
 go with the princes or stay here with us
queen isabel our gracious brother i will go with them
 haply a woman's voice may do some good
 when articles too nicely urged be stood on
king henry v yet leave our cousin katharine here with us
 she is our capital demand comprised
 within the forerank of our articles
queen isabel she hath good leave
 exeunt all except henry katharine and alice
king henry v fair katharine and most fair
 will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
 such as will enter at a lady's ear
 and plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart
katharine your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england
king henry v o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with
 your french heart i will be glad to hear you
 confess it brokenly with your english tongue do
 you like me kate
katharine pardonnezmoi i cannot tell vat is like me'
king henry v an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
katharine que ditil que je suis semblable a les anges
alice oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi ditil
king henry v i said so dear katharine and i must not blush to
 affirm it
katharine o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
 tromperies
king henry v what says she fair one that the tongues of men
 are full of deceits
alice oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
 deceits dat is de princess
king henry v the princess is the better englishwoman i faith
 kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am
 glad thou canst speak no better english for if
 thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king
 that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my
 crown i know no ways to mince it in love but
 directly to say i love you then if you urge me
 farther than to say do you in faith i wear out
 my suit give me your answer i faith do and so
 clap hands and a bargain how say you lady
katharine sauf votre honneur me understand vell
king henry v marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
 your sake kate why you undid me for the one i
 have neither words nor measure and for the other i
 have no strength in measure yet a reasonable
 measure in strength if i could win a lady at
 leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my
 armour on my back under the correction of bragging
 be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife
 or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse
 for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and
 sit like a jackanapes never off but before god
 kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
 eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation
 only downright oaths which i never use till urged
 nor never break for urging if thou canst love a
 fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth
 sunburning that never looks in his glass for love
 of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy
 cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst
 love me for this take me if not to say to thee
 that i shall die is true but for thy love by the
 lord no yet i love thee too and while thou
 livest dear kate take a fellow of plain and
 uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee
 right because he hath not the gift to woo in other
 places for these fellows of infinite tongue that
 can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do
 always reason themselves out again what a
 speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a
 good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a
 black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow
 bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax
 hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the
 moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it
 shines bright and never changes but keeps his
 course truly if thou would have such a one take
 me and take me take a soldier take a soldier
 take a king and what sayest thou then to my love
 speak my fair and fairly i pray thee
katharine is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france
king henry v no it is not possible you should love the enemy of
 france kate but in loving me you should love
 the friend of france for i love france so well that
 i will not part with a village of it i will have it
 all mine and kate when france is mine and i am
 yours then yours is france and you are mine
katharine i cannot tell vat is dat
king henry v no kate i will tell thee in french which i am
 sure will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried
 wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook
 off je quand sur le possession de france et quand
 vous avez le possession de moilet me see what
 then saint denis be my speeddonc votre est
 france et vous etes mienne it is as easy for me
 kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
 more french i shall never move thee in french
 unless it be to laugh at me
katharine sauf votre honneur le francois que vous parlez il
 est meilleur que l'anglois lequel je parle
king henry v no faith is't not kate but thy speaking of my
 tongue and i thine most trulyfalsely must needs
 be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou
 understand thus much english canst thou love me
katharine i cannot tell
king henry v can any of your neighbours tell kate i'll ask
 them come i know thou lovest me and at night
 when you come into your closet you'll question this
 gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to
 her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
 your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the
 rather gentle princess because i love thee
 cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a
 saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get
 thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs
 prove a good soldierbreeder shall not thou and i
 between saint denis and saint george compound a
 boy half french half english that shall go to
 constantinople and take the turk by the beard
 shall we not what sayest thou my fair
 flowerdeluce
katharine i do not know dat
king henry v no tis hereafter to know but now to promise do
 but now promise kate you will endeavour for your
 french part of such a boy and for my english moiety
 take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer
 you la plus belle katharine du monde mon tres cher
 et devin deesse
katharine your majestee ave fausse french enough to deceive de
 most sage demoiselle dat is en france
king henry v now fie upon my false french by mine honour in
 true english i love thee kate by which honour i
 dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to
 flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor
 and untempering effect of my visage now beshrew
 my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars
 when he got me therefore was i created with a
 stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when
 i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith
 kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear
 my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of
 beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou
 hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou
 shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better
 and therefore tell me most fair katharine will you
 have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the
 thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress
 take me by the hand and say harry of england i am
 thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
 ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is
 thine ireland is thine france is thine and harry
 plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before
 his face if he be not fellow with the best king
 thou shalt find the best king of good fellows

 music and thy english broken therefore queen of
 all katharine break thy mind to me in broken
 english wilt thou have me

 serviteur excusezmoi je vous supplie mon
 trespuissant seigneur
king henry v then i will kiss your lips kate
katharine les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
 leur noces il n'est pas la coutume de france
king henry v madam my interpreter what says she
alice dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
 francei cannot tell vat is baiser en anglish
king henry v to kiss
alice your majesty entendre bettre que moi
king henry v it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss
 before they are married would she say
alice oui vraiment
king henry v o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear
 kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak
 list of a country's fashion we are the makers of
 manners kate and the liberty that follows our
 places stops the mouth of all findfaults as i will
 do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your
 country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently
 and yielding
 kissing her
 you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is
 more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
 tongues of the french council and they should
 sooner persuade harry of england than a general
 petition of monarchs here comes your father
 reenter the french king and his queen burgundy
 and other lords
burgundy god save your majesty my royal cousin teach you
 our princess english
king henry v i would have her learn my fair cousin how
 perfectly i love her and that is good english
burgundy is she not apt
king henry v our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
 smooth so that having neither the voice nor the
 heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up
 the spirit of love in her that he will appear in
 his true likeness
burgundy pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you
 for that if you would conjure in her you must
 make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true
 likeness he must appear naked and blind can you
 blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the
 virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the
 appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
 self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid
 to consign to
king henry v yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces
burgundy they are then excused my lord when they see not
 what they do
king henry v then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking
burgundy i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will
 teach her to know my meaning for maids well
 summered and warm kept are like flies at
 bartholomewtide blind though they have their
 eyes and then they will endure handling which
 before would not abide looking on
king henry v this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer
 and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the
 latter end and she must be blind too
burgundy as love is my lord before it loves
king henry v it is so and you may some of you thank love for
 my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city
 for one fair french maid that stands in my way
french king yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
 turned into a maid for they are all girdled with
 maiden walls that war hath never entered
king henry v shall kate be my wife
french king so please you
king henry v i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may
 wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for
 my wish shall show me the way to my will
french king we have consented to all terms of reason
king henry v is't so my lords of england
westmoreland the king hath granted every article
 his daughter first and then in sequel all
 according to their firm proposed natures
exeter only he hath not yet subscribed this
 where your majesty demands that the king of france
 having any occasion to write for matter of grant
 shall name your highness in this form and with this
 addition in french notre trescher fils henri roi
 d'angleterre heritier de france and thus in
 latin praeclarissimus filius noster henricus rex
 angliae et haeres franciae
french king nor this i have not brother so denied
 but your request shall make me let it pass
king henry v i pray you then in love and dear alliance
 let that one article rank with the rest
 and thereupon give me your daughter
french king take her fair son and from her blood raise up
 issue to me that the contending kingdoms
 of france and england whose very shores look pale
 with envy of each other's happiness
 may cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
 plant neighbourhood and christianlike accord
 in their sweet bosoms that never war advance
 his bleeding sword twixt england and fair france
all amen
king henry v now welcome kate and bear me witness all
 that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen
 flourish
queen isabel god the best maker of all marriages
 combine your hearts in one your realms in one
 as man and wife being two are one in love
 so be there twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
 that never may ill office or fell jealousy
 which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
 thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
 to make divorce of their incorporate league
 that english may as french french englishmen
 receive each other god speak this amen
all amen
king henry v prepare we for our marriageon which day
 my lord of burgundy we'll take your oath
 and all the peers for surety of our leagues
 then shall i swear to kate and you to me
 and may our oaths well kept and prosperous be
 sennet exeunt

chorus thus far with rough and allunable pen
 our bending author hath pursued the story
 in little room confining mighty men
 mangling by starts the full course of their glory
 small time but in that small most greatly lived
 this star of england fortune made his sword
 by which the world's best garden be achieved
 and of it left his son imperial lord
 henry the sixth in infant bands crown'd king
 of france and england did this king succeed
 whose state so many had the managing
 that they lost france and made his england bleed
 which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake

 the prologue
 i come no more to make you laugh things now
 that bear a weighty and a serious brow
 sad high and working full of state and woe
 such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
 we now present those that can pity here
 may if they think it well let fall a tear
 the subject will deserve it such as give
 their money out of hope they may believe
 may here find truth too those that come to see
 only a show or two and so agree
 the play may pass if they be still and willing
 i'll undertake may see away their shilling
 richly in two short hours only they
 that come to hear a merry bawdy play
 a noise of targets or to see a fellow
 in a long motley coat guarded with yellow
 will be deceived for gentle hearers know
 to rank our chosen truth with such a show
 as fool and fight is beside forfeiting
 our own brains and the opinion that we bring
 to make that only true we now intend
 will leave us never an understanding friend
 therefore for goodness sake and as you are known
 the first and happiest hearers of the town
 be sad as we would make ye think ye see
 the very persons of our noble story
 as they were living think you see them great
 and follow'd with the general throng and sweat
 of thousand friends then in a moment see
 how soon this mightiness meets misery
 and if you can be merry then i'll say
 a man may weep upon his weddingday
 king henry viii
act i
scene i london an antechamber in the palace
 enter norfolk at one door at the other buckingham
 and abergavenny
buckingham good morrow and well met how have ye done
 since last we saw in france
norfolk i thank your grace
 healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
 of what i saw there
buckingham an untimely ague
 stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
 those suns of glory those two lights of men
 met in the vale of andren
norfolk twixt guynes and arde
 i was then present saw them salute on horseback
 beheld them when they lighted how they clung
 in their embracement as they grew together
 which had they what four throned ones could have weigh'd
 such a compounded one
buckingham all the whole time
 i was my chamber's prisoner
norfolk then you lost
 the view of earthly glory men might say
 till this time pomp was single but now married
 to one above itself each following day
 became the next day's master till the last
 made former wonders its today the french
 all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
 shone down the english and tomorrow they
 made britain india every man that stood
 show'd like a mine their dwarfish pages were
 as cherubins all guilt the madams too
 not used to toil did almost sweat to bear
 the pride upon them that their very labour
 was to them as a painting now this masque
 was cried incomparable and the ensuing night
 made it a fool and beggar the two kings
 equal in lustre were now best now worst
 as presence did present them him in eye
 still him in praise and being present both
 twas said they saw but one and no discerner
 durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns
 for so they phrase emby their heralds challenged
 the noble spirits to arms they did perform
 beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story
 being now seen possible enough got credit
 that bevis was believed
buckingham o you go far
norfolk as i belong to worship and affect
 in honour honesty the tract of every thing
 would by a good discourser lose some life
 which action's self was tongue to all was royal
 to the disposing of it nought rebell'd
 order gave each thing view the office did
 distinctly his full function
buckingham who did guide
 i mean who set the body and the limbs
 of this great sport together as you guess
norfolk one certes that promises no element
 in such a business
buckingham i pray you who my lord
norfolk all this was order'd by the good discretion
 of the right reverend cardinal of york
buckingham the devil speed him no man's pie is freed
 from his ambitious finger what had he
 to do in these fierce vanities i wonder
 that such a keech can with his very bulk
 take up the rays o the beneficial sun
 and keep it from the earth
norfolk surely sir
 there's in him stuff that puts him to these ends
 for being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace
 chalks successors their way nor call'd upon
 for high feats done to the crown neither allied
 for eminent assistants but spiderlike
 out of his selfdrawing web he gives us note
 the force of his own merit makes his way
 a gift that heaven gives for him which buys
 a place next to the king
abergavenny i cannot tell
 what heaven hath given himlet some graver eye
 pierce into that but i can see his pride
 peep through each part of him whence has he that
 if not from hell the devil is a niggard
 or has given all before and he begins
 a new hell in himself
buckingham why the devil
 upon this french going out took he upon him
 without the privity o the king to appoint
 who should attend on him he makes up the file
 of all the gentry for the most part such
 to whom as great a charge as little honour
 he meant to lay upon and his own letter
 the honourable board of council out
 must fetch him in the papers
abergavenny i do know
 kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
 by this so sickened their estates that never
 they shall abound as formerly
buckingham o many
 have broke their backs with laying manors on em
 for this great journey what did this vanity
 but minister communication of
 a most poor issue
norfolk grievingly i think
 the peace between the french and us not values
 the cost that did conclude it
buckingham every man
 after the hideous storm that follow'd was
 a thing inspired and not consulting broke
 into a general prophecy that this tempest
 dashing the garment of this peace aboded
 the sudden breach on't
norfolk which is budded out
 for france hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd
 our merchants goods at bourdeaux
abergavenny is it therefore
 the ambassador is silenced
norfolk marry is't
abergavenny a proper title of a peace and purchased
 at a superfluous rate
buckingham why all this business
 our reverend cardinal carried
norfolk like it your grace
 the state takes notice of the private difference
 betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you
 and take it from a heart that wishes towards you
 honour and plenteous safetythat you read
 the cardinal's malice and his potency
 together to consider further that
 what his high hatred would effect wants not
 a minister in his power you know his nature
 that he's revengeful and i know his sword
 hath a sharp edge it's long and t may be said
 it reaches far and where twill not extend
 thither he darts it bosom up my counsel
 you'll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock
 that i advise your shunning
 enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him
 certain of the guard and two secretaries with
 papers cardinal wolsey in his passage fixeth his
 eye on buckingham and buckingham on him both full
 of disdain
cardinal wolsey the duke of buckingham's surveyor ha
 where's his examination
first secretary here so please you
cardinal wolsey is he in person ready
first secretary ay please your grace
cardinal wolsey well we shall then know more and buckingham
 shall lessen this big look
 exeunt cardinal wolsey and his train
buckingham this butcher's cur is venommouth'd and i
 have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
 not wake him in his slumber a beggar's book
 outworths a noble's blood
norfolk what are you chafed
 ask god for temperance that's the appliance only
 which your disease requires
buckingham i read in's looks
 matter against me and his eye reviled
 me as his abject object at this instant
 he bores me with some trick he's gone to the king
 i'll follow and outstare him
norfolk stay my lord
 and let your reason with your choler question
 what tis you go about to climb steep hills
 requires slow pace at first anger is like
 a fullhot horse who being allow'd his way
 selfmettle tires him not a man in england
 can advise me like you be to yourself
 as you would to your friend
buckingham i'll to the king
 and from a mouth of honour quite cry down
 this ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim
 there's difference in no persons
norfolk be advised
 heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
 that it do singe yourself we may outrun
 by violent swiftness that which we run at
 and lose by overrunning know you not
 the fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er
 in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised
 i say again there is no english soul
 more stronger to direct you than yourself
 if with the sap of reason you would quench
 or but allay the fire of passion
buckingham sir
 i am thankful to you and i'll go along
 by your prescription but this topproud fellow
 whom from the flow of gall i name not but
 from sincere motions by intelligence
 and proofs as clear as founts in july when
 we see each grain of gravel i do know
 to be corrupt and treasonous
norfolk say not treasonous'
buckingham to the king i'll say't and make my vouch as strong
 as shore of rock attend this holy fox
 or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravenous
 as he is subtle and as prone to mischief
 as able to perform't his mind and place
 infecting one another yea reciprocally
 only to show his pomp as well in france
 as here at home suggests the king our master
 to this last costly treaty the interview
 that swallow'd so much treasure and like a glass
 did break i the rinsing
norfolk faith and so it did
buckingham pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal
 the articles o the combination drew
 as himself pleased and they were ratified
 as he cried thus let be to as much end
 as give a crutch to the dead but our countcardinal
 has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey
 who cannot err he did it now this follows
 which as i take it is a kind of puppy
 to the old dam treasoncharles the emperor
 under pretence to see the queen his aunt
 for twas indeed his colour but he came
 to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation
 his fears were that the interview betwixt
 england and france might through their amity
 breed him some prejudice for from this league
 peep'd harms that menaced him he privily
 deals with our cardinal and as i trow
 which i do well for i am sure the emperor
 paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted
 ere it was ask'd but when the way was made
 and paved with gold the emperor thus desired
 that he would please to alter the king's course
 and break the foresaid peace let the king know
 as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal
 does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
 and for his own advantage

 to hear this of him and could wish he were
 something mistaken in't

 thanks you for this great care i stood i the level
 of a fullcharged confederacy and give thanks
 to you that choked it let be call'd before us
 that gentleman of buckingham's in person

queen katharine nay we must longer kneel i am a suitor
king henry viii arise and take place by us half your suit
 never name to us you have half our power
 the other moiety ere you ask is given
 repeat your will and take it
queen katharine thank your majesty
 that you would love yourself and in that love
 not unconsider'd leave your honour nor
 the dignity of your office is the point
 of my petition
king henry viii lady mine proceed
queen katharine i am solicited not by a few
 and those of true condition that your subjects
 are in great grievance there have been commissions
 sent down among em which hath flaw'd the heart
 of all their loyalties wherein although
 my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches
 most bitterly on you as putter on
 of these exactions yet the king our master
 whose honour heaven shield from soileven he
 escapes not
 language unmannerly yea such which breaks
 the sides of loyalty and almost appears
 in loud rebellion
norfolk not almost appears
 it doth appear for upon these taxations
 the clothiers all not able to maintain
 the many to them longing have put off
 the spinsters carders fullers weavers who
 unfit for other life compell'd by hunger
 and lack of other means in desperate manner
 daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar
 and danger serves among then
king henry viii taxation
 wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal
 you that are blamed for it alike with us
 know you of this taxation
cardinal wolsey please you sir
 i know but of a single part in aught
 pertains to the state and front but in that file
 where others tell steps with me
queen katharine no my lord
 you know no more than others but you frame
 things that are known alike which are not wholesome
 to those which would not know them and yet must
 perforce be their acquaintance these exactions
 whereof my sovereign would have note they are
 most pestilent to the bearing and to bear em
 the back is sacrifice to the load they say
 they are devised by you or else you suffer
 too hard an exclamation
king henry viii still exaction
 the nature of it in what kind let's know
 is this exaction
queen katharine i am much too venturous
 in tempting of your patience but am bolden'd
 under your promised pardon the subjects grief
 comes through commissions which compel from each
 the sixth part of his substance to be levied
 without delay and the pretence for this
 is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths
 tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
 allegiance in them their curses now
 live where their prayers did and it's come to pass
 this tractable obedience is a slave
 to each incensed will i would your highness
 would give it quick consideration for
 there is no primer business
king henry viii by my life
 this is against our pleasure
cardinal wolsey and for me
 i have no further gone in this than by
 a single voice and that not pass'd me but
 by learned approbation of the judges if i am
 traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know
 my faculties nor person yet will be
 the chronicles of my doing let me say
 tis but the fate of place and the rough brake
 that virtue must go through we must not stint
 our necessary actions in the fear
 to cope malicious censurers which ever
 as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow
 that is newtrimm'd but benefit no further
 than vainly longing what we oft do best
 by sick interpreters once weak ones is
 not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft
 hitting a grosser quality is cried up
 for our best act if we shall stand still
 in fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at
 we should take root here where we sit or sit
 statestatues only
king henry viii things done well
 and with a care exempt themselves from fear
 things done without example in their issue
 are to be fear'd have you a precedent
 of this commission i believe not any
 we must not rend our subjects from our laws
 and stick them in our will sixth part of each
 a trembling contribution why we take
 from every tree lop bark and part o the timber
 and though we leave it with a root thus hack'd
 the air will drink the sap to every county
 where this is question'd send our letters with
 free pardon to each man that has denied
 the force of this commission pray look to't
 i put it to your care
cardinal wolsey a word with you
 to the secretary
 let there be letters writ to every shire
 of the king's grace and pardon the grieved commons
 hardly conceive of me let it be noised
 that through our intercession this revokement
 and pardon comes i shall anon advise you
 further in the proceeding
 exit secretary
 enter surveyor
queen katharine i am sorry that the duke of buckingham
 is run in your displeasure
king henry viii it grieves many
 the gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker
 to nature none more bound his training such
 that he may furnish and instruct great teachers
 and never seek for aid out of himself yet see
 when these so noble benefits shall prove
 not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt
 they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
 than ever they were fair this man so complete
 who was enroll'd mongst wonders and when we
 almost with ravish'd listening could not find
 his hour of speech a minute he my lady
 hath into monstrous habits put the graces
 that once were his and is become as black
 as if besmear'd in hell sit by us you shall hear
 this was his gentleman in trustof him
 things to strike honour sad bid him recount
 the forerecited practises whereof
 we cannot feel too little hear too much
cardinal wolsey stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
 most like a careful subject have collected
 out of the duke of buckingham
king henry viii speak freely
surveyor first it was usual with him every day
 it would infect his speech that if the king
 should without issue die he'll carry it so
 to make the sceptre his these very words
 i've heard him utter to his soninlaw
 lord abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced
 revenge upon the cardinal
cardinal wolsey please your highness note
 this dangerous conception in this point
 not friended by by his wish to your high person
 his will is most malignant and it stretches
 beyond you to your friends
queen katharine my learn'd lord cardinal
 deliver all with charity
king henry viii speak on
 how grounded he his title to the crown
 upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him
 at any time speak aught
surveyor he was brought to this
 by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins
king henry viii what was that hopkins
surveyor sir a chartreux friar
 his confessor who fed him every minute
 with words of sovereignty
king henry viii how know'st thou this
surveyor not long before your highness sped to france
 the duke being at the rose within the parish
 saint lawrence poultney did of me demand
 what was the speech among the londoners
 concerning the french journey i replied
 men fear'd the french would prove perfidious
 to the king's danger presently the duke
 said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
 twould prove the verity of certain words
 spoke by a holy monk that oft says he
 hath sent to me wishing me to permit
 john de la car my chaplain a choice hour
 to hear from him a matter of some moment
 whom after under the confession's seal
 he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
 my chaplain to no creature living but
 to me should utter with demure confidence
 this pausingly ensued neither the king nor's heirs
 tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive
 to gain the love o the commonalty the duke
 shall govern england'
queen katharine if i know you well
 you were the duke's surveyor and lost your office
 on the complaint o the tenants take good heed
 you charge not in your spleen a noble person
 and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed
 yes heartily beseech you
king henry viii let him on
 go forward
surveyor on my soul i'll speak but truth
 i told my lord the duke by the devil's illusions
 the monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him
 to ruminate on this so far until
 it forged him some design which being believed
 it was much like to do he answer'd tush
 it can do me no damage adding further
 that had the king in his last sickness fail'd
 the cardinal's and sir thomas lovell's heads
 should have gone off
king henry viii ha what so rank ah ha
 there's mischief in this man canst thou say further
surveyor i can my liege
king henry viii proceed
surveyor being at greenwich
 after your highness had reproved the duke
 about sir william blomer
king henry viii i remember
 of such a time being my sworn servant
 the duke retain'd him his but on what hence
surveyor if quoth he i for this had been committed
 as to the tower i thought i would have play'd
 the part my father meant to act upon
 the usurper richard who being at salisbury
 made suit to come in's presence which if granted
 as he made semblance of his duty would
 have put his knife to him'
king henry viii a giant traitor
cardinal wolsey now madam may his highness live in freedom
 and this man out of prison
queen katharine god mend all
king henry viii there's something more would out of thee what say'st
surveyor after the duke his father with the knife'
 he stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger
 another spread on's breast mounting his eyes
 he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor
 waswere he evil used he would outgo
 his father by as much as a performance
 does an irresolute purpose
king henry viii there's his period
 to sheathe his knife in us he is attach'd
 call him to present trial if he may
 find mercy in the law tis his if none
 let him not seek t of us by day and night
 he's traitor to the height

 short blister'd breeches and those types of travel
 and understand again like honest men
 or pack to their old playfellows there i take it

act ii
scene i westminster a street
 enter two gentlemen meeting
first gentleman whither away so fast
second gentleman o god save ye
 even to the hall to hear what shall become
 of the great duke of buckingham
first gentleman i'll save you
 that labour sir all's now done but the ceremony
 of bringing back the prisoner
second gentleman were you there
first gentleman yes indeed was i
second gentleman pray speak what has happen'd
first gentleman you may guess quickly what
second gentleman is he found guilty
first gentleman yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't
second gentleman i am sorry for't
first gentleman so are a number more
second gentleman but pray how pass'd it
first gentleman i'll tell you in a little the great duke
 came to the bar where to his accusations
 he pleaded still not guilty and alleged
 many sharp reasons to defeat the law
 the king's attorney on the contrary
 urged on the examinations proofs confessions
 of divers witnesses which the duke desired
 to have brought viva voce to his face
 at which appear'd against him his surveyor
 sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car
 confessor to him with that devilmonk
 hopkins that made this mischief
second gentleman that was he
 that fed him with his prophecies
first gentleman the same
 all these accused him strongly which he fain
 would have flung from him but indeed he could not
 and so his peers upon this evidence
 have found him guilty of high treason much
 he spoke and learnedly for life but all
 was either pitied in him or forgotten
second gentleman after all this how did he bear himself
first gentleman when he was brought again to the bar to hear
 his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd
 with such an agony he sweat extremely
 and something spoke in choler ill and hasty
 but he fell to himself again and sweetly
 in all the rest show'd a most noble patience
second gentleman i do not think he fears death
first gentleman sure he does not
 he never was so womanish the cause
 he may a little grieve at
second gentleman certainly
 the cardinal is the end of this
first gentleman tis likely
 by all conjectures first kildare's attainder
 then deputy of ireland who removed
 earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too
 lest he should help his father
second gentleman that trick of state
 was a deep envious one
first gentleman at his return
 no doubt he will requite it this is noted
 and generally whoever the king favours
 the cardinal instantly will find employment
 and far enough from court too
second gentleman all the commons
 hate him perniciously and o my conscience
 wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
 they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham
 the mirror of all courtesy
first gentleman stay there sir
 and see the noble ruin'd man you speak of
 enter buckingham from his arraignment tipstaves
 before him the axe with the edge towards him
 halberds on each side accompanied with lovell
 vaux sands and common people
second gentleman let's stand close and behold him
buckingham all good people
 you that thus far have come to pity me
 hear what i say and then go home and lose me
 i have this day received a traitor's judgment
 and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
 and if i have a conscience let it sink me
 even as the axe falls if i be not faithful
 the law i bear no malice for my death
 t has done upon the premises but justice
 but those that sought it i could wish more christians
 be what they will i heartily forgive em
 yet let em look they glory not in mischief
 nor build their evils on the graves of great men
 for then my guiltless blood must cry against em
 for further life in this world i ne'er hope
 nor will i sue although the king have mercies
 more than i dare make faults you few that loved me
 and dare be bold to weep for buckingham
 his noble friends and fellows whom to leave
 is only bitter to him only dying
 go with me like good angels to my end
 and as the long divorce of steel falls on me
 make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
 and lift my soul to heaven lead on o god's name
lovell i do beseech your grace for charity
 if ever any malice in your heart
 were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
buckingham sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you
 as i would be forgiven i forgive all
 there cannot be those numberless offences
 gainst me that i cannot take peace with
 no black envy
 shall mark my grave commend me to his grace
 and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him
 you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers
 yet are the king's and till my soul forsake
 shall cry for blessings on him may he live
 longer than i have time to tell his years
 ever beloved and loving may his rule be
 and when old time shall lead him to his end
 goodness and he fill up one monument
lovell to the water side i must conduct your grace
 then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux
 who undertakes you to your end
vaux prepare there
 the duke is coming see the barge be ready
 and fit it with such furniture as suits
 the greatness of his person
buckingham nay sir nicholas
 let it alone my state now will but mock me
 when i came hither i was lord high constable
 and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun
 yet i am richer than my base accusers
 that never knew what truth meant i now seal it
 and with that blood will make em one day groan for't
 my noble father henry of buckingham
 who first raised head against usurping richard
 flying for succor to his servant banister
 being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd
 and without trial fell god's peace be with him
 henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying
 my father's loss like a most royal prince
 restored me to my honours and out of ruins
 made my name once more noble now his son
 henry the eighth life honour name and all
 that made me happy at one stroke has taken
 for ever from the world i had my trial
 and must needs say a noble one which makes me
 a little happier than my wretched father
 yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
 fell by our servants by those men we loved most
 a most unnatural and faithless service
 heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
 this from a dying man receive as certain
 where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
 be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
 and give your hearts to when they once perceive
 the least rub in your fortunes fall away
 like water from ye never found again
 but where they mean to sink ye all good people
 pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour
 of my long weary life is come upon me farewell
 and when you would say something that is sad
 speak how i fell i have done and god forgive me
 exeunt buckingham and train
first gentleman o this is full of pity sir it calls
 i fear too many curses on their beads
 that were the authors
second gentleman if the duke be guiltless
 tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling
 of an ensuing evil if it fall
 greater than this
first gentleman good angels keep it from us
 what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir
second gentleman this secret is so weighty twill require
 a strong faith to conceal it
first gentleman let me have it
 i do not talk much
second gentleman i am confident
 you shall sir did you not of late days hear
 a buzzing of a separation
 between the king and katharine
first gentleman yes but it held not
 for when the king once heard it out of anger
 he sent command to the lord mayor straight
 to stop the rumor and allay those tongues
 that durst disperse it
second gentleman but that slander sir
 is found a truth now for it grows again
 fresher than e'er it was and held for certain
 the king will venture at it either the cardinal
 or some about him near have out of malice
 to the good queen possess'd him with a scruple
 that will undo her to confirm this too
 cardinal campeius is arrived and lately
 as all think for this business
first gentleman tis the cardinal
 and merely to revenge him on the emperor
 for not bestowing on him at his asking
 the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed
second gentleman i think you have hit the mark but is't not cruel
 that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal
 will have his will and she must fall
first gentleman tis woful
 we are too open here to argue this
 let's think in private more

scene ii an antechamber in the palace
 enter chamberlain reading a letter
chamberlain my lord the horses your lordship sent for with
 all the care i had i saw well chosen ridden and
 furnished they were young and handsome and of the
 best breed in the north when they were ready to
 set out for london a man of my lord cardinal's by
 commission and main power took em from me with
 this reason his master would be served before a
 subject if not before the king which stopped our
 mouths sir'
 i fear he will indeed well let him have them
 he will have all i think
 enter to chamberlain norfolk and suffolk
norfolk well met my lord chamberlain
chamberlain good day to both your graces
suffolk how is the king employ'd
chamberlain i left him private
 full of sad thoughts and troubles
norfolk what's the cause
chamberlain it seems the marriage with his brother's wife
 has crept too near his conscience
suffolk no his conscience
 has crept too near another lady
norfolk tis so
 this is the cardinal's doing the kingcardinal
 that blind priest like the eldest son of fortune
 turns what he list the king will know him one day
suffolk pray god he do he'll never know himself else
norfolk how holily he works in all his business
 and with what zeal for now he has crack'd the league
 between us and the emperor the queen's great nephew
 he dives into the king's soul and there scatters
 dangers doubts wringing of the conscience

anne not for that neither here's the pang that pinches
 his highness having lived so long with her and she
 so good a lady that no tongue could ever
 pronounce dishonour of her by my life
 she never knew harmdoing o now after
 so many courses of the sun enthroned
 still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
 to leave a thousandfold more bitter than
 tis sweet at first to acquireafter this process
 to give her the avaunt it is a pity
 would move a monster
old lady hearts of most hard temper
 melt and lament for her
anne o god's will much better
 she ne'er had known pomp though't be temporal
 yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce
 it from the bearer tis a sufferance panging
 as soul and body's severing
old lady alas poor lady
 she's a stranger now again
anne so much the more
 must pity drop upon her verily
 i swear tis better to be lowly born
 and range with humble livers in content
 than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief
 and wear a golden sorrow
old lady our content
 is our best having
anne by my troth and maidenhead
 i would not be a queen
old lady beshrew me i would
 and venture maidenhead for't and so would you
 for all this spice of your hypocrisy
 you that have so fair parts of woman on you
 have too a woman's heart which ever yet
 affected eminence wealth sovereignty
 which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts
 saving your mincing the capacity
 of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
 if you might please to stretch it
anne nay good troth
old lady yes troth and troth you would not be a queen
anne no not for all the riches under heaven
old lady tis strange a threepence bow'd would hire me
 old as i am to queen it but i pray you
 what think you of a duchess have you limbs
 to bear that load of title
anne no in truth
old lady then you are weakly made pluck off a little
 i would not be a young count in your way
 for more than blushing comes to if your back
 cannot vouchsafe this burthen'tis too weak
 ever to get a boy
anne how you do talk
 i swear again i would not be a queen
 for all the world
old lady in faith for little england
 you'ld venture an emballing i myself
 would for carnarvonshire although there long'd
 no more to the crown but that lo who comes here
 enter chamberlain
chamberlain good morrow ladies what were't worth to know
 the secret of your conference
anne my good lord
 not your demand it values not your asking
 our mistress sorrows we were pitying
chamberlain it was a gentle business and becoming
 the action of good women there is hope
 all will be well
anne now i pray god amen
chamberlain you bear a gentle mind and heavenly blessings
 follow such creatures that you may fair lady
 perceive i speak sincerely and high note's
 ta'en of your many virtues the king's majesty
 commends his good opinion of you and
 does purpose honour to you no less flowing
 than marchioness of pembroke to which title
 a thousand pound a year annual support
 out of his grace he adds
anne i do not know
 what kind of my obedience i should tender
 more than my all is nothing nor my prayers
 are not words duly hallow'd nor my wishes
 more worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes
 are all i can return beseech your lordship
 vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience
 as from a blushing handmaid to his highness
 whose health and royalty i pray for
chamberlain lady
 i shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
 the king hath of you

 beauty and honour in her are so mingled
 that they have caught the king and who knows yet
 but from this lady may proceed a gem
 to lighten all this isle i'll to the king

anne come you are pleasant
old lady with your theme i could

 that thus you should proceed to put me off
 and take your good grace from me heaven witness
 i have been to you a true and humble wife
 at all times to your will conformable
 ever in fear to kindle your dislike
 yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry
 as i saw it inclined when was the hour
 i ever contradicted your desire
 or made it not mine too or which of your friends
 have i not strove to love although i knew
 he were mine enemy what friend of mine
 that had to him derived your anger did i
 continue in my liking nay gave notice
 he was from thence discharged sir call to mind

 the king your father was reputed for
 a prince most prudent of an excellent
 and unmatch'd wit and judgment ferdinand
 my father king of spain was reckon'd one
 the wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
 a year before it is not to be question'd
 that they had gather'd a wise council to them
 of every realm that did debate this business
 who deem'd our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly
 beseech you sir to spare me till i may
 be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel
 i will implore if not i the name of god
 your pleasure be fulfill'd
cardinal wolsey you have here lady
 and of your choice these reverend fathers men
 of singular integrity and learning
 yea the elect o the land who are assembled
 to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless
 that longer you desire the court as well
 for your own quiet as to rectify
 what is unsettled in the king
cardinal campeius his grace
 hath spoken well and justly therefore madam
 it's fit this royal session do proceed
 and that without delay their arguments
 be now produced and heard
queen katharine lord cardinal
 to you i speak
cardinal wolsey your pleasure madam
queen katharine sir
 i am about to weep but thinking that
 we are a queen or long have dream'd so certain
 the daughter of a king my drops of tears
 i'll turn to sparks of fire
cardinal wolsey be patient yet
queen katharine i will when you are humble nay before
 or god will punish me i do believe
 induced by potent circumstances that
 you are mine enemy and make my challenge
 you shall not be my judge for it is you
 have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me
 which god's dew quench therefore i say again
 i utterly abhor yea from my soul
 refuse you for my judge whom yet once more
 i hold my most malicious foe and think not
 at all a friend to truth
cardinal wolsey i do profess
 you speak not like yourself who ever yet
 have stood to charity and display'd the effects
 of disposition gentle and of wisdom
 o'ertopping woman's power madam you do me wrong
 i have no spleen against you nor injustice
 for you or any how far i have proceeded
 or how far further shall is warranted
 by a commission from the consistory
 yea the whole consistory of rome you charge me
 that i have blown this coal i do deny it
 the king is present if it be known to him
 that i gainsay my deed how may he wound
 and worthily my falsehood yea as much
 as you have done my truth if he know
 that i am free of your report he knows
 i am not of your wrong therefore in him
 it lies to cure me and the cure is to
 remove these thoughts from you the which before
 his highness shall speak in i do beseech
 you gracious madam to unthink your speaking
 and to say so no more
queen katharine my lord my lord
 i am a simple woman much too weak
 to oppose your cunning you're meek and
 humblemouth'd
 you sign your place and calling in full seeming
 with meekness and humility but your heart
 is cramm'd with arrogancy spleen and pride
 you have by fortune and his highness favours
 gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
 where powers are your retainers and your words
 domestics to you serve your will as't please
 yourself pronounce their office i must tell you
 you tender more your person's honour than
 your high profession spiritual that again
 i do refuse you for my judge and here
 before you all appeal unto the pope
 to bring my whole cause fore his holiness
 and to be judged by him
 she curtsies to king henry viii and offers to depart
cardinal campeius the queen is obstinate
 stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and
 disdainful to be tried by't tis not well
 she's going away
king henry viii call her again
crier katharine queen of england come into the court
griffith madam you are call'd back
queen katharine what need you note it pray you keep your way
 when you are call'd return now the lord help
 they vex me past my patience pray you pass on
 i will not tarry no nor ever more
 upon this business my appearance make
 in any of their courts
 exeunt queen katharine and her attendants
king henry viii go thy ways kate
 that man i the world who shall report he has
 a better wife let him in nought be trusted
 for speaking false in that thou art alone
 if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
 thy meekness saintlike wifelike government
 obeying in commanding and thy parts
 sovereign and pious else could speak thee out
 the queen of earthly queens she's noble born
 and like her true nobility she has
 carried herself towards me
cardinal wolsey most gracious sir
 in humblest manner i require your highness
 that it shall please you to declare in hearing
 of all these earsfor where i am robb'd and bound
 there must i be unloosed although not there
 at once and fully satisfiedwhether ever i
 did broach this business to your highness or
 laid any scruple in your way which might
 induce you to the question on't or ever
 have to you but with thanks to god for such
 a royal lady spake one the least word that might
 be to the prejudice of her present state
 or touch of her good person
king henry viii my lord cardinal
 i do excuse you yea upon mine honour
 i free you from't you are not to be taught
 that you have many enemies that know not
 why they are so but like to villagecurs
 bark when their fellows do by some of these
 the queen is put in anger you're excused
 but will you be more justified you ever
 have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desired
 it to be stirr'd but oft have hinder'd oft
 the passages made toward it on my honour
 i speak my good lord cardinal to this point
 and thus far clear him now what moved me to't
 i will be bold with time and your attention
 then mark the inducement thus it came give heed to't
 my conscience first received a tenderness
 scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd
 by the bishop of bayonne then french ambassador
 who had been hither sent on the debating
 a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and
 our daughter mary i the progress of this business
 ere a determinate resolution he
 i mean the bishop did require a respite
 wherein he might the king his lord advertise
 whether our daughter were legitimate
 respecting this our marriage with the dowager
 sometimes our brother's wife this respite shook
 the bosom of my conscience enter'd me
 yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
 the region of my breast which forced such way
 that many mazed considerings did throng
 and press'd in with this caution first methought
 i stood not in the smile of heaven who had
 commanded nature that my lady's womb
 if it conceived a male child by me should
 do no more offices of life to't than
 the grave does to the dead for her male issue
 or died where they were made or shortly after
 this world had air'd them hence i took a thought
 this was a judgment on me that my kingdom
 well worthy the best heir o the world should not
 be gladded in't by me then follows that
 i weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
 by this my issue's fail and that gave to me
 many a groaning throe thus hulling in
 the wild sea of my conscience i did steer
 toward this remedy whereupon we are
 now present here together that's to say
 i meant to rectify my consciencewhich
 i then did feel full sick and yet not well
 by all the reverend fathers of the land
 and doctors learn'd first i began in private
 with you my lord of lincoln you remember
 how under my oppression i did reek
 when i first moved you
lincoln very well my liege
king henry viii i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say
 how far you satisfied me
lincoln so please your highness
 the question did at first so stagger me
 bearing a state of mighty moment in't
 and consequence of dread that i committed
 the daring'st counsel which i had to doubt
 and did entreat your highness to this course
 which you are running here
king henry viii i then moved you
 my lord of canterbury and got your leave
 to make this present summons unsolicited
 i left no reverend person in this court
 but by particular consent proceeded
 under your hands and seals therefore go on
 for no dislike i the world against the person
 of the good queen but the sharp thorny points
 of my alleged reasons drive this forward
 prove but our marriage lawful by my life
 and kingly dignity we are contented
 to wear our mortal state to come with her
 katharine our queen before the primest creature
 that's paragon'd o the world
cardinal campeius so please your highness
 the queen being absent tis a needful fitness
 that we adjourn this court till further day
 meanwhile must be an earnest motion
 made to the queen to call back her appeal
 she intends unto his holiness
king henry viii aside i may perceive
 these cardinals trifle with me i abhor
 this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome
 my learn'd and wellbeloved servant cranmer
 prithee return with thy approach i know
 my comfort comes along break up the court
 i say set on

 orpheus with his lute made trees
 and the mountain tops that freeze
 bow themselves when he did sing
 to his music plants and flowers

 what are your pleasures with me reverend lords
cardinal wolsey may it please you noble madam to withdraw
 into your private chamber we shall give you
 the full cause of our coming
queen katharine speak it here
 there's nothing i have done yet o my conscience
 deserves a corner would all other women
 could speak this with as free a soul as i do
 my lords i care not so much i am happy
 above a number if my actions
 were tried by every tongue every eye saw em
 envy and base opinion set against em
 i know my life so even if your business
 seek me out and that way i am wife in
 out with it boldly truth loves open dealing
cardinal wolsey tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina
 serenissima
queen katharine o good my lord no latin
 i am not such a truant since my coming
 as not to know the language i have lived in
 a strange tongue makes my cause more strange
 suspicious
 pray speak in english here are some will thank you
 if you speak truth for their poor mistress sake
 believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal
 the willing'st sin i ever yet committed
 may be absolved in english
cardinal wolsey noble lady
 i am sorry my integrity should breed
 and service to his majesty and you
 so deep suspicion where all faith was meant
 we come not by the way of accusation
 to taint that honour every good tongue blesses
 nor to betray you any way to sorrow
 you have too much good lady but to know
 how you stand minded in the weighty difference
 between the king and you and to deliver
 like free and honest men our just opinions
 and comforts to your cause
cardinal campeius most honour'd madam
 my lord of york out of his noble nature
 zeal and obedience he still bore your grace
 forgetting like a good man your late censure
 both of his truth and him which was too far
 offers as i do in a sign of peace
 his service and his counsel
queen katharine aside to betray me
 my lords i thank you both for your good wills
 ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so
 but how to make ye suddenly an answer
 in such a point of weight so near mine honour
 more near my life i fearwith my weak wit
 and to such men of gravity and learning
 in truth i know not i was set at work
 among my maids full little god knows looking
 either for such men or such business
 for her sake that i have beenfor i feel
 the last fit of my greatnessgood your graces
 let me have time and counsel for my cause
 alas i am a woman friendless hopeless
cardinal wolsey madam you wrong the king's love with these fears
 your hopes and friends are infinite
queen katharine in england
 but little for my profit can you think lords
 that any englishman dare give me counsel
 or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure
 though he be grown so desperate to be honest
 and live a subject nay forsooth my friends
 they that must weigh out my afflictions
 they that my trust must grow to live not here
 they are as all my other comforts far hence
 in mine own country lords
cardinal campeius i would your grace
 would leave your griefs and take my counsel
queen katharine how sir
cardinal campeius put your main cause into the king's protection
 he's loving and most gracious twill be much
 both for your honour better and your cause
 for if the trial of the law o'ertake ye
 you'll part away disgraced
cardinal wolsey he tells you rightly
queen katharine ye tell me what ye wish for bothmy ruin
 is this your christian counsel out upon ye
 heaven is above all yet there sits a judge
 that no king can corrupt
cardinal campeius your rage mistakes us
queen katharine the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye
 upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
 but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye
 mend em for shame my lords is this your comfort
 the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
 a woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd
 i will not wish ye half my miseries
 i have more charity but say i warn'd ye
 take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once
 the burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye
cardinal wolsey madam this is a mere distraction
 you turn the good we offer into envy
queen katharine ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye
 and all such false professors would you have me
 if you have any justice any pity
 if ye be any thing but churchmen's habits
 put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
 alas has banish'd me his bed already
 his love too long ago i am old my lords
 and all the fellowship i hold now with him
 is only my obedience what can happen
 to me above this wretchedness all your studies
 make me a curse like this
cardinal campeius your fears are worse
queen katharine have i lived thus longlet me speak myself
 since virtue finds no friendsa wife a true one
 a woman i dare say without vainglory
 never yet branded with suspicion
 have i with all my full affections
 still met the king loved him next heaven
 obey'd him
 been out of fondness superstitious to him
 almost forgot my prayers to content him
 and am i thus rewarded tis not well lords
 bring me a constant woman to her husband
 one that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure
 and to that woman when she has done most
 yet will i add an honour a great patience
cardinal wolsey madam you wander from the good we aim at
queen katharine my lord i dare not make myself so guilty
 to give up willingly that noble title
 your master wed me to nothing but death
 shall e'er divorce my dignities
cardinal wolsey pray hear me
queen katharine would i had never trod this english earth
 or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
 ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts
 what will become of me now wretched lady
 i am the most unhappy woman living
 alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes
 shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity
 no friend no hope no kindred weep for me
 almost no grave allow'd me like the lily
 that once was mistress of the field and flourish'd
 i'll hang my head and perish
cardinal wolsey if your grace
 could but be brought to know our ends are honest
 you'ld feel more comfort why should we good lady
 upon what cause wrong you alas our places
 the way of our profession is against it
 we are to cure such sorrows not to sow em
 for goodness sake consider what you do
 how you may hurt yourself ay utterly
 grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage
 the hearts of princes kiss obedience
 so much they love it but to stubborn spirits
 they swell and grow as terrible as storms
 i know you have a gentle noble temper
 a soul as even as a calm pray think us
 those we profess peacemakers friends and servants
cardinal campeius madam you'll find it so you wrong your virtues
 with these weak women's fears a noble spirit
 as yours was put into you ever casts
 such doubts as false coin from it the king loves you
 beware you lose it not for us if you please
 to trust us in your business we are ready
 to use our utmost studies in your service
queen katharine do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me
 if i have used myself unmannerly
 you know i am a woman lacking wit
 to make a seemly answer to such persons
 pray do my service to his majesty
 he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
 while i shall have my life come reverend fathers
 bestow your counsels on me she now begs
 that little thought when she set footing here
 she should have bought her dignities so dear

suffolk which of the peers
 have uncontemn'd gone by him or at least
 strangely neglected when did he regard
 the stamp of nobleness in any person
 out of himself
chamberlain my lords you speak your pleasures
 what he deserves of you and me i know
 what we can do to him though now the time
 gives way to us i much fear if you cannot
 bar his access to the king never attempt
 any thing on him for he hath a witchcraft
 over the king in's tongue
norfolk o fear him not
 his spell in that is out the king hath found
 matter against him that for ever mars
 the honey of his language no he's settled
 not to come off in his displeasure
surrey sir
 i should be glad to hear such news as this
 once every hour
norfolk believe it this is true
 in the divorce his contrary proceedings
 are all unfolded wherein he appears
 as i would wish mine enemy
surrey how came
 his practises to light
suffolk most strangely
surrey o how how
suffolk the cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried
 and came to the eye o the king wherein was read
 how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
 to stay the judgment o the divorce for if
 it did take place i do quoth he perceive
 my king is tangled in affection to
 a creature of the queen's lady anne bullen'
surrey has the king this
suffolk believe it
surrey will this work
chamberlain the king in this perceives him how he coasts
 and hedges his own way but in this point
 all his tricks founder and he brings his physic
 after his patient's death the king already
 hath married the fair lady
surrey would he had
suffolk may you be happy in your wish my lord
 for i profess you have it
surrey now all my joy
 trace the conjunction
suffolk my amen to't
norfolk all men's
suffolk there's order given for her coronation
 marry this is yet but young and may be left
 to some ears unrecounted but my lords
 she is a gallant creature and complete
 in mind and feature i persuade me from her
 will fall some blessing to this land which shall
 in it be memorised
surrey but will the king
 digest this letter of the cardinal's
 the lord forbid
norfolk marry amen
suffolk no no
 there be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
 will make this sting the sooner cardinal campeius
 is stol'n away to rome hath ta'en no leave
 has left the cause o the king unhandled and
 is posted as the agent of our cardinal
 to second all his plot i do assure you
 the king cried ha at this
chamberlain now god incense him
 and let him cry ha louder
norfolk but my lord
 when returns cranmer
suffolk he is return'd in his opinions which
 have satisfied the king for his divorce
 together with all famous colleges
 almost in christendom shortly i believe
 his second marriage shall be publish'd and
 her coronation katharine no more
 shall be call'd queen but princess dowager
 and widow to prince arthur
norfolk this same cranmer's
 a worthy fellow and hath ta'en much pain
 in the king's business

 was in his countenance you he bade
 attend him here this morning

 to hear from rome the marchioness of pembroke
norfolk he's discontented
suffolk may be he hears the king
 does whet his anger to him
surrey sharp enough
 lord for thy justice
cardinal wolsey aside the late queen's gentlewoman
 a knight's daughter
 to be her mistress mistress the queen's queen
 this candle burns not clear tis i must snuff it
 then out it goes what though i know her virtuous
 and well deserving yet i know her for
 a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to
 our cause that she should lie i the bosom of
 our hardruled king again there is sprung up
 an heretic an arch one cranmer one
 hath crawl'd into the favour of the king
 and is his oracle
norfolk he is vex'd at something
surrey i would twere something that would fret the string
 the mastercord on's heart
 enter king henry viii reading of a schedule and lovell
suffolk the king the king
king henry viii what piles of wealth hath he accumulated
 to his own portion and what expense by the hour
 seems to flow from him how i the name of thrift
 does he rake this together now my lords
 saw you the cardinal
norfolk my lord we have
 stood here observing him some strange commotion
 is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
 stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
 then lays his finger on his temple straight
 springs out into fast gait then stops again
 strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
 his eye against the moon in most strange postures
 we have seen him set himself
king henry viii it may well be
 there is a mutiny in's mind this morning
 papers of state he sent me to peruse
 as i required and wot you what i found
 thereon my conscience put unwittingly
 forsooth an inventory thus importing
 the several parcels of his plate his treasure
 rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
 i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
 possession of a subject
norfolk it's heaven's will
 some spirit put this paper in the packet
 to bless your eye withal
king henry viii if we did think
 his contemplation were above the earth
 and fix'd on spiritual object he should still
 dwell in his musings but i am afraid
 his thinkings are below the moon not worth
 his serious considering
 king henry viii takes his seat whispers lovell
 who goes to cardinal wolsey
cardinal wolsey heaven forgive me
 ever god bless your highness
king henry viii good my lord
 you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
 of your best graces in your mind the which
 you were now running o'er you have scarce time
 to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
 to keep your earthly audit sure in that
 i deem you an ill husband and am glad
 to have you therein my companion
cardinal wolsey sir
 for holy offices i have a time a time
 to think upon the part of business which
 i bear i the state and nature does require
 her times of preservation which perforce
 i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
 must give my tendence to
king henry viii you have said well
cardinal wolsey and ever may your highness yoke together
 as i will lend you cause my doing well
 with my well saying
king henry viii tis well said again
 and tis a kind of good deed to say well
 and yet words are no deeds my father loved you
 his said he did and with his deed did crown
 his word upon you since i had my office
 i have kept you next my heart have not alone
 employ'd you where high profits might come home
 but pared my present havings to bestow
 my bounties upon you
cardinal wolsey aside what should this mean
surrey aside the lord increase this business
king henry viii have i not made you
 the prime man of the state i pray you tell me
 if what i now pronounce you have found true
 and if you may confess it say withal
 if you are bound to us or no what say you
cardinal wolsey my sovereign i confess your royal graces
 shower'd on me daily have been more than could
 my studied purposes requite which went
 beyond all man's endeavours my endeavours
 have ever come too short of my desires
 yet filed with my abilities mine own ends
 have been mine so that evermore they pointed
 to the good of your most sacred person and
 the profit of the state for your great graces
 heap'd upon me poor undeserver i
 can nothing render but allegiant thanks
 my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty
 which ever has and ever shall be growing
 till death that winter kill it
king henry viii fairly answer'd
 a loyal and obedient subject is
 therein illustrated the honour of it
 does pay the act of it as i the contrary
 the foulness is the punishment i presume
 that as my hand has open'd bounty to you
 my heart dropp'd love my power rain'd honour more
 on you than any so your hand and heart
 your brain and every function of your power
 should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
 as twere in love's particular be more
 to me your friend than any
cardinal wolsey i do profess
 that for your highness good i ever labour'd
 more than mine own that am have and will be
 though all the world should crack their duty to you
 and throw it from their soul though perils did
 abound as thick as thought could make em and
 appear in forms more horridyet my duty
 as doth a rock against the chiding flood
 should the approach of this wild river break
 and stand unshaken yours
king henry viii tis nobly spoken
 take notice lords he has a loyal breast
 for you have seen him open't read o'er this
 giving him papers
 and after this and then to breakfast with
 what appetite you have
 exit king henry viii frowning upon cardinal wolsey
 the nobles throng after him smiling and whispering
cardinal wolsey what should this mean
 what sudden anger's this how have i reap'd it
 he parted frowning from me as if ruin
 leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
 upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him
 then makes him nothing i must read this paper
 i fear the story of his anger tis so
 this paper has undone me tis the account
 of all that world of wealth i have drawn together
 for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
 and fee my friends in rome o negligence
 fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil
 made me put this main secret in the packet
 i sent the king is there no way to cure this
 no new device to beat this from his brains
 i know twill stir him strongly yet i know
 a way if it take right in spite of fortune
 will bring me off again what's this to the pope'
 the letter as i live with all the business
 i writ to's holiness nay then farewell
 i have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness
 and from that full meridian of my glory
 i haste now to my setting i shall fall
 like a bright exhalation m the evening
 and no man see me more
 reenter to cardinal wolsey norfolk and suffolk surrey
 and the chamberlain
norfolk hear the king's pleasure cardinal who commands you
 to render up the great seal presently
 into our hands and to confine yourself
 to asher house my lord of winchester's
 till you hear further from his highness
cardinal wolsey stay
 where's your commission lords words cannot carry
 authority so weighty
suffolk who dare cross em
 bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly
cardinal wolsey till i find more than will or words to do it
 i mean your malice know officious lords
 i dare and must deny it now i feel
 of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy
 how eagerly ye follow my disgraces
 as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
 ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
 follow your envious courses men of malice
 you have christian warrant for em and no doubt
 in time will find their fit rewards that seal
 you ask with such a violence the king
 mine and your master with his own hand gave me
 bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
 during my life and to confirm his goodness
 tied it by letterspatents now who'll take it
surrey the king that gave it
cardinal wolsey it must be himself then
surrey thou art a proud traitor priest
cardinal wolsey proud lord thou liest
 within these forty hours surrey durst better
 have burnt that tongue than said so
surrey thy ambition
 thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land
 of noble buckingham my fatherinlaw
 the heads of all thy brother cardinals
 with thee and all thy best parts bound together
 weigh'd not a hair of his plague of your policy
 you sent me deputy for ireland
 far from his succor from the king from all
 that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him
 whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
 absolved him with an axe
cardinal wolsey this and all else
 this talking lord can lay upon my credit
 i answer is most false the duke by law
 found his deserts how innocent i was
 from any private malice in his end
 his noble jury and foul cause can witness
 if i loved many words lord i should tell you
 you have as little honesty as honour
 that in the way of loyalty and truth
 toward the king my ever royal master
 dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be
 and all that love his follies
surrey by my soul
 your long coat priest protects you thou
 shouldst feel
 my sword i the lifeblood of thee else my lords
 can ye endure to hear this arrogance
 and from this fellow if we live thus tamely
 to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
 farewell nobility let his grace go forward
 and dare us with his cap like larks
cardinal wolsey all goodness
 is poison to thy stomach
surrey yes that goodness
 of gleaning all the land's wealth into one
 into your own hands cardinal by extortion
 the goodness of your intercepted packets
 you writ to the pope against the king your goodness
 since you provoke me shall be most notorious
 my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble
 as you respect the common good the state
 of our despised nobility our issues
 who if he live will scarce be gentlemen
 produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
 collected from his life i'll startle you
 worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench
 lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal
cardinal wolsey how much methinks i could despise this man
 but that i am bound in charity against it
norfolk those articles my lord are in the king's hand
 but thus much they are foul ones
cardinal wolsey so much fairer
 and spotless shall mine innocence arise
 when the king knows my truth
surrey this cannot save you
 i thank my memory i yet remember
 some of these articles and out they shall
 now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal
 you'll show a little honesty
cardinal wolsey speak on sir
 i dare your worst objections if i blush
 it is to see a nobleman want manners
surrey i had rather want those than my head have at you
 first that without the king's assent or knowledge
 you wrought to be a legate by which power
 you maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops
norfolk then that in all you writ to rome or else
 to foreign princes ego et rex meus'
 was still inscribed in which you brought the king
 to be your servant
suffolk then that without the knowledge
 either of king or council when you went
 ambassador to the emperor you made bold
 to carry into flanders the great seal
surrey item you sent a large commission
 to gregory de cassado to conclude
 without the king's will or the state's allowance
 a league between his highness and ferrara
suffolk that out of mere ambition you have caused
 your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin
surrey then that you have sent innumerable substance
 by what means got i leave to your own conscience
 to furnish rome and to prepare the ways
 you have for dignities to the mere undoing
 of all the kingdom many more there are
 which since they are of you and odious
 i will not taint my mouth with
chamberlain o my lord
 press not a falling man too far tis virtue
 his faults lie open to the laws let them
 not you correct him my heart weeps to see him
 so little of his great self
surrey i forgive him
suffolk lord cardinal the king's further pleasure is
 because all those things you have done of late
 by your power legatine within this kingdom
 fall into the compass of a praemunire
 that therefore such a writ be sued against you
 to forfeit all your goods lands tenements
 chattels and whatsoever and to be
 out of the king's protection this is my charge
norfolk and so we'll leave you to your meditations
 how to live better for your stubborn answer
 about the giving back the great seal to us
 the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
 so fare you well my little good lord cardinal
 exeunt all but cardinal wolsey
cardinal wolsey so farewell to the little good you bear me
 farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
 this is the state of man today he puts forth
 the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms
 and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
 the third day comes a frost a killing frost
 and when he thinks good easy man full surely
 his greatness is aripening nips his root
 and then he falls as i do i have ventured
 like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
 this many summers in a sea of glory
 but far beyond my depth my highblown pride
 at length broke under me and now has left me
 weary and old with service to the mercy
 of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
 vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye
 i feel my heart new open'd o how wretched
 is that poor man that hangs on princes favours
 there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
 that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
 more pangs and fears than wars or women have
 and when he falls he falls like lucifer
 never to hope again
 enter cromwell and stands amazed
 why how now cromwell
cromwell i have no power to speak sir
cardinal wolsey what amazed
 at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder
 a great man should decline nay an you weep
 i am fall'n indeed
cromwell how does your grace
cardinal wolsey why well
 never so truly happy my good cromwell
 i know myself now and i feel within me
 a peace above all earthly dignities
 a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me
 i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders
 these ruin'd pillars out of pity taken
 a load would sink a navy too much honour
 o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen
 too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
cromwell i am glad your grace has made that right use of it
cardinal wolsey i hope i have i am able now methinks
 out of a fortitude of soul i feel
 to endure more miseries and greater far
 than my weakhearted enemies dare offer
 what news abroad
cromwell the heaviest and the worst
 is your displeasure with the king
cardinal wolsey god bless him
cromwell the next is that sir thomas more is chosen
 lord chancellor in your place
cardinal wolsey that's somewhat sudden
 but he's a learned man may he continue
 long in his highness favour and do justice
 for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones
 when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
 may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more
cromwell that cranmer is return'd with welcome
 install'd lord archbishop of canterbury
cardinal wolsey that's news indeed
cromwell last that the lady anne
 whom the king hath in secrecy long married
 this day was view'd in open as his queen
 going to chapel and the voice is now
 only about her coronation
cardinal wolsey there was the weight that pull'd me down o cromwell
 the king has gone beyond me all my glories
 in that one woman i have lost for ever
 no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
 or gild again the noble troops that waited
 upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell
 i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now
 to be thy lord and master seek the king
 that sun i pray may never set i have told him
 what and how true thou art he will advance thee
 some little memory of me will stir him
 i know his noble naturenot to let
 thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell
 neglect him not make use now and provide
 for thine own future safety
cromwell o my lord
 must i then leave you must i needs forego
 so good so noble and so true a master
 bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
 with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord
 the king shall have my service but my prayers
 for ever and for ever shall be yours
cardinal wolsey cromwell i did not think to shed a tear
 in all my miseries but thou hast forced me
 out of thy honest truth to play the woman
 let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell
 and when i am forgotten as i shall be
 and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
 of me more must be heard of say i taught thee
 say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
 and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
 found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in
 a sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it
 mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me
 cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition
 by that sin fell the angels how can man then
 the image of his maker hope to win by it
 love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee
 corruption wins not more than honesty
 still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
 to silence envious tongues be just and fear not
 let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's
 thy god's and truth's then if thou fall'st
 o cromwell
 thou fall'st a blessed martyr serve the king
 andprithee lead me in
 there take an inventory of all i have
 to the last penny tis the king's my robe
 and my integrity to heaven is all
 i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell
 had i but served my god with half the zeal
 i served my king he would not in mine age
 have left me naked to mine enemies
cromwell good sir have patience
cardinal wolsey so i have farewell
 the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell
 exeunt

act iv
scene i a street in westminster
 enter two gentlemen meeting one another
first gentleman you're well met once again
second gentleman so are you
first gentleman you come to take your stand here and behold
 the lady anne pass from her coronation
second gentleman tis all my business at our last encounter
 the duke of buckingham came from his trial
first gentleman tis very true but that time offer'd sorrow
 this general joy
second gentleman tis well the citizens
 i am sure have shown at full their royal minds
 as let em have their rights they are ever forward
 in celebration of this day with shows
 pageants and sights of honour
first gentleman never greater
 nor i'll assure you better taken sir
second gentleman may i be bold to ask at what that contains
 that paper in your hand
first gentleman yes tis the list
 of those that claim their offices this day
 by custom of the coronation
 the duke of suffolk is the first and claims
 to be highsteward next the duke of norfolk
 he to be earl marshal you may read the rest
second gentleman i thank you sir had i not known those customs
 i should have been beholding to your paper
 but i beseech you what's become of katharine
 the princess dowager how goes her business
first gentleman that i can tell you too the archbishop
 of canterbury accompanied with other
 learned and reverend fathers of his order
 held a late court at dunstable six miles off
 from ampthill where the princess lay to which
 she was often cited by them but appear'd not
 and to be short for not appearance and
 the king's late scruple by the main assent
 of all these learned men she was divorced
 and the late marriage made of none effect
 since which she was removed to kimbolton
 where she remains now sick
second gentleman alas good lady
 trumpets
 the trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming
 hautboys
 the order of the coronation
 1 a lively flourish of trumpets
 2 then two judges
 3 lord chancellor with the purse and mace
 before him
 4 choristers singing
 music
 5 mayor of london bearing the mace then
 garter in his coat of arms and on his
 head a gilt copper crown
 6 marquess dorset bearing a sceptre of gold
 on his head a demicoronal of gold with
 him surrey bearing the rod of silver with
 the dove crowned with an earl's coronet
 collars of ss
 7 suffolk in his robe of estate his coronet
 on his head bearing a long white wand as
 highsteward with him norfolk with the
 rod of marshalship a coronet on his head
 collars of ss
 8 a canopy borne by four of the cinqueports
 under it queen anne in her robe in her hair
 richly adorned with pearl crowned on each
 side her the bishops of london and
 winchester
 9 the old duchess of norfolk in a coronal of
 gold wrought with flowers bearing queen
 anne's train
 10 certain ladies or countesses with plain
 circlets of gold without flowers
 they pass over the stage in order and state
second gentleman a royal train believe me these i know
 who's that that bears the sceptre
first gentleman marquess dorset
 and that the earl of surrey with the rod
second gentleman a bold brave gentleman that should be
 the duke of suffolk
first gentleman tis the same highsteward
second gentleman and that my lord of norfolk
first gentleman yes
second gentleman heaven bless thee
 looking on queen anne
 thou hast the sweetest face i ever look'd on
 sir as i have a soul she is an angel
 our king has all the indies in his arms
 and more and richer when he strains that lady
 i cannot blame his conscience
first gentleman they that bear
 the cloth of honour over her are four barons
 of the cinqueports
second gentleman those men are happy and so are all are near her
 i take it she that carries up the train
 is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk
first gentleman it is and all the rest are countesses
second gentleman their coronets say so these are stars indeed
 and sometimes falling ones
first gentleman no more of that
 exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets
 enter a third gentleman
first gentleman god save you sir where have you been broiling
third gentleman among the crowd i the abbey where a finger
 could not be wedged in more i am stifled
 with the mere rankness of their joy
second gentleman you saw
 the ceremony
third gentleman that i did
first gentleman how was it
third gentleman well worth the seeing
second gentleman good sir speak it to us
third gentleman as well as i am able the rich stream
 of lords and ladies having brought the queen
 to a prepared place in the choir fell off
 a distance from her while her grace sat down
 to rest awhile some half an hour or so
 in a rich chair of state opposing freely
 the beauty of her person to the people
 believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
 that ever lay by man which when the people
 had the full view of such a noise arose
 as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
 as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks
 doublets i thinkflew up and had their faces
 been loose this day they had been lost such joy
 i never saw before greatbellied women
 that had not half a week to go like rams
 in the old time of war would shake the press
 and make em reel before em no man living
 could say this is my wife there all were woven
 so strangely in one piece
second gentleman but what follow'd
third gentleman at length her grace rose and with modest paces
 came to the altar where she kneel'd and saintlike
 cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly
 then rose again and bow'd her to the people
 when by the archbishop of canterbury
 she had all the royal makings of a queen
 as holy oil edward confessor's crown
 the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
 laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir
 with all the choicest music of the kingdom
 together sung te deum so she parted
 and with the same full state paced back again
 to yorkplace where the feast is held
first gentleman sir
 you must no more call it yorkplace that's past
 for since the cardinal fell that title's lost
 tis now the king's and call'd whitehall
third gentleman i know it
 but tis so lately alter'd that the old name
 is fresh about me
second gentleman what two reverend bishops
 were those that went on each side of the queen
third gentleman stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester
 newly preferr'd from the king's secretary
 the other london
second gentleman he of winchester
 is held no great good lover of the archbishop's
 the virtuous cranmer
third gentleman all the land knows that
 however yet there is no great breach when it comes
 cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him
second gentleman who may that be i pray you
third gentleman thomas cromwell
 a man in much esteem with the king and truly
 a worthy friend the king has made him master
 o the jewel house
 and one already of the privy council
second gentleman he will deserve more
third gentleman yes without all doubt
 come gentlemen ye shall go my way which
 is to the court and there ye shall be my guests
 something i can command as i walk thither
 i'll tell ye more
both you may command us sir
 exeunt

act iv
scene ii kimbolton
 enter katharine dowager sick led between
 griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman
griffith how does your grace
katharine o griffith sick to death
 my legs like loaden branches bow to the earth
 willing to leave their burthen reach a chair
 so now methinks i feel a little ease
 didst thou not tell me griffith as thou led'st me
 that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead
griffith yes madam but i think your grace
 out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't
katharine prithee good griffith tell me how he died
 if well he stepp'd before me happily
 for my example
griffith well the voice goes madam
 for after the stout earl northumberland
 arrested him at york and brought him forward
 as a man sorely tainted to his answer
 he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
 he could not sit his mule
katharine alas poor man
griffith at last with easy roads he came to leicester
 lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot
 with all his covent honourably received him
 to whom he gave these words o father abbot
 an old man broken with the storms of state
 is come to lay his weary bones among ye
 give him a little earth for charity'
 so went to bed where eagerly his sickness
 pursued him still and three nights after this
 about the hour of eight which he himself
 foretold should be his last full of repentance
 continual meditations tears and sorrows
 he gave his honours to the world again
 his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
katharine so may he rest his faults lie gently on him
 yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him
 and yet with charity he was a man
 of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
 himself with princes one that by suggestion
 tied all the kingdom simony was fairplay
 his own opinion was his law i the presence
 he would say untruths and be ever double
 both in his words and meaning he was never
 but where he meant to ruin pitiful
 his promises were as he then was mighty
 but his performance as he is now nothing
 of his own body he was ill and gave
 the clergy in example
griffith noble madam
 men's evil manners live in brass their virtues
 we write in water may it please your highness
 to hear me speak his good now
katharine yes good griffith
 i were malicious else
griffith this cardinal
 though from an humble stock undoubtedly
 was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle
 he was a scholar and a ripe and good one
 exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading
 lofty and sour to them that loved him not
 but to those men that sought him sweet as summer
 and though he were unsatisfied in getting
 which was a sin yet in bestowing madam
 he was most princely ever witness for him
 those twins of learning that he raised in you
 ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him
 unwilling to outlive the good that did it
 the other though unfinish'd yet so famous
 so excellent in art and still so rising
 that christendom shall ever speak his virtue
 his overthrow heap'd happiness upon him
 for then and not till then he felt himself
 and found the blessedness of being little
 and to add greater honours to his age
 than man could give him he died fearing god
katharine after my death i wish no other herald
 no other speaker of my living actions
 to keep mine honour from corruption
 but such an honest chronicler as griffith
 whom i most hated living thou hast made me
 with thy religious truth and modesty
 now in his ashes honour peace be with him
 patience be near me still and set me lower
 i have not long to trouble thee good griffith
 cause the musicians play me that sad note
 i named my knell whilst i sit meditating
 on that celestial harmony i go to
 sad and solemn music
griffith she is asleep good wench let's sit down quiet
 for fear we wake her softly gentle patience
 the vision enter solemnly tripping one after
 another six personages clad in white robes
 wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden
 vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in
 their hands they first congee unto her then
 dance and at certain changes the first two hold
 a spare garland over her head at which the other
 four make reverent curtsies then the two that held
 the garland deliver the same to the other next two
 who observe the same order in their changes and
 holding the garland over her head which done
 they deliver the same garland to the last two who
 likewise observe the same order at which as it
 were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs
 of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven
 and so in their dancing vanish carrying the
 garland with them the music continues
katharine spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone
 and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye
griffith madam we are here
katharine it is not you i call for
 saw ye none enter since i slept
griffith none madam

 cast thousand beams upon me like the sun

 and brought me garlands griffith which i feel
 i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly

 possess your fancy
katharine bid the music leave
 they are harsh and heavy to me
 music ceases

 beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding
 she is young and of a noble modest nature
 i hope she will deserve welland a little
 to love her for her mother's sake that loved him
 heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition
 is that his noble grace would have some pity
 upon my wretched women that so long
 have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully
 of which there is not one i dare avow
 and now i should not lie but will deserve
 for virtue and true beauty of the soul
 for honesty and decent carriage
 a right good husband let him be a noble
 and sure those men are happy that shall have em
 the last is for my men they are the poorest
 but poverty could never draw em from me
 that they may have their wages duly paid em
 and something over to remember me by
 if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
 and able means we had not parted thus
 these are the whole contents and good my lord
 by that you love the dearest in this world

scene iii the councilchamber
 enter chancellor places himself at the upper end
 of the table on the left hand a seat being left
 void above him as for cranmer's seat suffolk
 norfolk surrey chamberlain gardiner seat
 themselves in order on each side cromwell at
 lower end as secretary keeper at the door
chancellor speak to the business mastersecretary
 why are we met in council
cromwell please your honours
 the chief cause concerns his grace of canterbury
gardiner has he had knowledge of it
cromwell yes
norfolk who waits there
keeper without my noble lords
gardiner yes
keeper my lord archbishop
 and has done half an hour to know your pleasures
chancellor let him come in
keeper your grace may enter now
 cranmer enters and approaches the counciltable
chancellor my good lord archbishop i'm very sorry
 to sit here at this present and behold
 that chair stand empty but we all are men
 in our own natures frail and capable
 of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
 and want of wisdom you that best should teach us
 have misdemean'd yourself and not a little
 toward the king first then his laws in filling
 the whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
 for so we are inform'd with new opinions
 divers and dangerous which are heresies
 and not reform'd may prove pernicious
gardiner which reformation must be sudden too
 my noble lords for those that tame wild horses
 pace em not in their hands to make em gentle
 but stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur em
 till they obey the manage if we suffer
 out of our easiness and childish pity
 to one man's honour this contagious sickness
 farewell all physic and what follows then
 commotions uproars with a general taint
 of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
 the upper germany can dearly witness
 yet freshly pitied in our memories
cranmer my good lords hitherto in all the progress
 both of my life and office i have labour'd
 and with no little study that my teaching
 and the strong course of my authority
 might go one way and safely and the end
 was ever to do well nor is there living
 i speak it with a single heart my lords
 a man that more detests more stirs against
 both in his private conscience and his place
 defacers of a public peace than i do
 pray heaven the king may never find a heart
 with less allegiance in it men that make
 envy and crooked malice nourishment
 dare bite the best i do beseech your lordships
 that in this case of justice my accusers
 be what they will may stand forth face to face
 and freely urge against me
suffolk nay my lord
 that cannot be you are a counsellor
 and by that virtue no man dare accuse you
gardiner my lord because we have business of more moment
 we will be short with you tis his highness pleasure
 and our consent for better trial of you
 from hence you be committed to the tower
 where being but a private man again
 you shall know many dare accuse you boldly
 more than i fear you are provided for
cranmer ah my good lord of winchester i thank you
 you are always my good friend if your will pass
 i shall both find your lordship judge and juror
 you are so merciful i see your end
 tis my undoing love and meekness lord
 become a churchman better than ambition
 win straying souls with modesty again
 cast none away that i shall clear myself
 lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
 i make as little doubt as you do conscience
 in doing daily wrongs i could say more
 but reverence to your calling makes me modest
gardiner my lord my lord you are a sectary
 that's the plain truth your painted gloss discovers
 to men that understand you words and weakness
cromwell my lord of winchester you are a little
 by your good favour too sharp men so noble
 however faulty yet should find respect
 for what they have been tis a cruelty
 to load a falling man
gardiner good master secretary
 i cry your honour mercy you may worst
 of all this table say so
cromwell why my lord
gardiner do not i know you for a favourer
 of this new sect ye are not sound
cromwell not sound
gardiner not sound i say
cromwell would you were half so honest
 men's prayers then would seek you not their fears
gardiner i shall remember this bold language
cromwell do
 remember your bold life too
chancellor this is too much
 forbear for shame my lords
gardiner i have done
cromwell and i
chancellor then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
 i take it by all voices that forthwith
 you be convey'd to the tower a prisoner
 there to remain till the king's further pleasure
 be known unto us are you all agreed lords
all we are
cranmer is there no other way of mercy
 but i must needs to the tower my lords
gardiner what other
 would you expect you are strangely troublesome
 let some o the guard be ready there
 enter guard
cranmer for me
 must i go like a traitor thither
gardiner receive him
 and see him safe i the tower
cranmer stay good my lords
 i have a little yet to say look there my lords
 by virtue of that ring i take my cause
 out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
 to a most noble judge the king my master
chamberlain this is the king's ring
surrey tis no counterfeit
suffolk tis the right ring by heaven i told ye all
 when ye first put this dangerous stone arolling
 twould fall upon ourselves
norfolk do you think my lords
 the king will suffer but the little finger
 of this man to be vex'd
chancellor tis now too certain
 how much more is his life in value with him
 would i were fairly out on't
cromwell my mind gave me
 in seeking tales and informations
 against this man whose honesty the devil
 and his disciples only envy at
 ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye
 enter king frowning on them takes his seat
gardiner dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
 in daily thanks that gave us such a prince
 not only good and wise but most religious
 one that in all obedience makes the church
 the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
 that holy duty out of dear respect
 his royal self in judgment comes to hear
 the cause betwixt her and this great offender
king henry viii you were ever good at sudden commendations
 bishop of winchester but know i come not
 to hear such flattery now and in my presence
 they are too thin and bare to hide offences
 to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
 and think with wagging of your tongue to win me
 but whatsoe'er thou takest me for i'm sure
 thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
 to cranmer
 good man sit down now let me see the proudest
 he that dares most but wag his finger at thee
 by all that's holy he had better starve
 than but once think this place becomes thee not
surrey may it please your grace
king henry viii no sir it does not please me
 i had thought i had had men of some understanding
 and wisdom of my council but i find none
 was it discretion lords to let this man
 this good manfew of you deserve that title
 this honest man wait like a lousy footboy
 at chamberdoor and one as great as you are
 why what a shame was this did my commission
 bid ye so far forget yourselves i gave ye
 power as he was a counsellor to try him
 not as a groom there's some of ye i see
 more out of malice than integrity
 would try him to the utmost had ye mean
 which ye shall never have while i live
chancellor thus far
 my most dread sovereign may it like your grace
 to let my tongue excuse all what was purposed
 concerning his imprisonment was rather
 if there be faith in men meant for his trial
 and fair purgation to the world than malice
 i'm sure in me
king henry viii well well my lords respect him
 take him and use him well he's worthy of it
 i will say thus much for him if a prince
 may be beholding to a subject i
 am for his love and service so to him
 make me no more ado but all embrace him
 be friends for shame my lords my lord of
 canterbury
 i have a suit which you must not deny me
 that is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
 you must be godfather and answer for her
cranmer the greatest monarch now alive may glory
 in such an honour how may i deserve it
 that am a poor and humble subject to you
king henry viii come come my lord you'ld spare your spoons you
 shall have two noble partners with you the old
 duchess of norfolk and lady marquess dorset will
 these please you
 once more my lord of winchester i charge you
 embrace and love this man
gardiner with a true heart
 and brotherlove i do it
cranmer and let heaven
 witness how dear i hold this confirmation
king henry viii good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
 the common voice i see is verified
 of thee which says thus do my lord of canterbury
 a shrewd turn and he is your friend for ever'
 come lords we trifle time away i long
 to have this young one made a christian
 as i have made ye one lords one remain
 so i grow stronger you more honour gain

 boys behind em loose shot delivered such a shower
 of pebbles that i was fain to draw mine honour in

 and fight for bitten apples that no audience but

 so shall she leave her blessedness to one
 when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness
 who from the sacred ashes of her honour
 shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was
 and so stand fix'd peace plenty love truth terror
 that were the servants to this chosen infant
 shall then be his and like a vine grow to him
 wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine
 his honour and the greatness of his name
 shall be and make new nations he shall flourish
 and like a mountain cedar reach his branches
 to all the plains about him our children's children
 shall see this and bless heaven
king henry viii thou speakest wonders
cranmer she shall be to the happiness of england
 an aged princess many days shall see her
 and yet no day without a deed to crown it
 would i had known no more but she must die
 she must the saints must have her yet a virgin
 a most unspotted lily shall she pass
 to the ground and all the world shall mourn her
king henry viii o lord archbishop
 thou hast made me now a man never before
 this happy child did i get any thing
 this oracle of comfort has so pleased me
 that when i am in heaven i shall desire
 to see what this child does and praise my maker

 epilogue
 tis ten to one this play can never please
 all that are here some come to take their ease
 and sleep an act or two but those we fear
 we have frighted with our trumpets so tis clear
 they'll say tis naught others to hear the city
 abused extremely and to cry that's witty'
 which we have not done neither that i fear
 all the expected good we're like to hear
 for this play at this time is only in
 the merciful construction of good women
 for such a one we show'd em if they smile
 and say twill do i know within a while
 all the best men are ours for tis ill hap
 if they hold when their ladies bid em clap

 and sullen presage of your own decay
 an honourable conduct let him have
 pembroke look to t farewell chatillon
 exeunt chatillon and pembroke
queen elinor what now my son have i not ever said
 how that ambitious constance would not cease
 till she had kindled france and all the world
 upon the right and party of her son
 this might have been prevented and made whole
 with very easy arguments of love
 which now the manage of two kingdoms must
 with fearful bloody issue arbitrate
king john our strong possession and our right for us
queen elinor your strong possession much more than your right
 or else it must go wrong with you and me
 so much my conscience whispers in your ear
 which none but heaven and you and i shall hear
 enter a sheriff
essex my liege here is the strangest controversy
 come from country to be judged by you
 that e'er i heard shall i produce the men
king john let them approach
 our abbeys and our priories shall pay
 this expedition's charge
 enter robert and the bastard
 what men are you
bastard your faithful subject i a gentleman
 born in northamptonshire and eldest son
 as i suppose to robert faulconbridge
 a soldier by the honourgiving hand
 of coeurdelion knighted in the field
king john what art thou
robert the son and heir to that same faulconbridge
king john is that the elder and art thou the heir
 you came not of one mother then it seems
bastard most certain of one mother mighty king
 that is well known and as i think one father
 but for the certain knowledge of that truth
 i put you o'er to heaven and to my mother
 of that i doubt as all men's children may
queen elinor out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
 and wound her honour with this diffidence
bastard i madam no i have no reason for it
 that is my brother's plea and none of mine
 the which if he can prove a pops me out
 at least from fair five hundred pound a year
 heaven guard my mother's honour and my land
king john a good blunt fellow why being younger born
 doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
bastard i know not why except to get the land
 but once he slander'd me with bastardy
 but whether i be as true begot or no
 that still i lay upon my mother's head
 but that i am as well begot my liege
 fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
 compare our faces and be judge yourself
 if old sir robert did beget us both
 and were our father and this son like him
 o old sir robert father on my knee
 i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee
king john why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
queen elinor he hath a trick of coeurdelion's face
 the accent of his tongue affecteth him
 do you not read some tokens of my son
 in the large composition of this man
king john mine eye hath well examined his parts
 and finds them perfect richard sirrah speak
 what doth move you to claim your brother's land
bastard because he hath a halfface like my father
 with half that face would he have all my land
 a halffaced groat five hundred pound a year
robert my gracious liege when that my father lived
 your brother did employ my father much
bastard well sir by this you cannot get my land
 your tale must be how he employ'd my mother
robert and once dispatch'd him in an embassy
 to germany there with the emperor
 to treat of high affairs touching that time
 the advantage of his absence took the king
 and in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's
 where how he did prevail i shame to speak
 but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
 between my father and my mother lay
 as i have heard my father speak himself
 when this same lusty gentleman was got
 upon his deathbed he by will bequeath'd
 his lands to me and took it on his death
 that this my mother's son was none of his
 and if he were he came into the world
 full fourteen weeks before the course of time
 then good my liege let me have what is mine
 my father's land as was my father's will
king john sirrah your brother is legitimate
 your father's wife did after wedlock bear him
 and if she did play false the fault was hers
 which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
 that marry wives tell me how if my brother
 who as you say took pains to get this son
 had of your father claim'd this son for his
 in sooth good friend your father might have kept
 this calf bred from his cow from all the world
 in sooth he might then if he were my brother's
 my brother might not claim him nor your father
 being none of his refuse him this concludes
 my mother's son did get your father's heir
 your father's heir must have your father's land
robert shall then my father's will be of no force
 to dispossess that child which is not his
bastard of no more force to dispossess me sir
 than was his will to get me as i think
queen elinor whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge
 and like thy brother to enjoy thy land
 or the reputed son of coeurdelion
 lord of thy presence and no land beside
bastard madam an if my brother had my shape
 and i had his sir robert's his like him
 and if my legs were two such ridingrods
 my arms such eelskins stuff'd my face so thin
 that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose
 lest men should say look where threefarthings goes'
 and to his shape were heir to all this land
 would i might never stir from off this place
 i would give it every foot to have this face
 i would not be sir nob in any case
queen elinor i like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune
 bequeath thy land to him and follow me
 i am a soldier and now bound to france
bastard brother take you my land i'll take my chance
 your face hath got five hundred pound a year
 yet sell your face for five pence and tis dear
 madam i'll follow you unto the death
queen elinor nay i would have you go before me thither
bastard our country manners give our betters way
king john what is thy name
bastard philip my liege so is my name begun
 philip good old sir robert's wife's eldest son
king john from henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st
 kneel thou down philip but rise more great
 arise sir richard and plantagenet
bastard brother by the mother's side give me your hand
 my father gave me honour yours gave land
 now blessed by the hour by night or day
 when i was got sir robert was away
queen elinor the very spirit of plantagenet
 i am thy grandam richard call me so
bastard madam by chance but not by truth what though
 something about a little from the right
 in at the window or else o'er the hatch
 who dares not stir by day must walk by night
 and have is have however men do catch
 near or far off well won is still well shot
 and i am i howe'er i was begot
king john go faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
 a landless knight makes thee a landed squire
 come madam and come richard we must speed
 for france for france for it is more than need
bastard brother adieu good fortune come to thee
 for thou wast got i the way of honesty
 exeunt all but bastard
 a foot of honour better than i was
 but many a many foot of land the worse
 well now can i make any joan a lady
 good den sir richard''godamercy fellow'
 and if his name be george i'll call him peter
 for newmade honour doth forget men's names
 tis too respective and too sociable
 for your conversion now your traveller
 he and his toothpick at my worship's mess
 and when my knightly stomach is sufficed
 why then i suck my teeth and catechise
 my picked man of countries my dear sir'
 thus leaning on mine elbow i begin
 i shall beseech you'that is question now
 and then comes answer like an absey book
 o sir says answer at your best command
 at your employment at your service sir'
 no sir says question i sweet sir at yours'
 and so ere answer knows what question would
 saving in dialogue of compliment
 and talking of the alps and apennines
 the pyrenean and the river po
 it draws toward supper in conclusion so
 but this is worshipful society
 and fits the mounting spirit like myself
 for he is but a bastard to the time
 that doth not smack of observation
 and so am i whether i smack or no
 and not alone in habit and device
 exterior form outward accoutrement
 but from the inward motion to deliver
 sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth
 which though i will not practise to deceive
 yet to avoid deceit i mean to learn
 for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
 but who comes in such haste in ridingrobes
 what womanpost is this hath she no husband
 that will take pains to blow a horn before her
 enter lady faulconbridge and gurney
 o me it is my mother how now good lady
 what brings you here to court so hastily
lady faulconbridge where is that slave thy brother where is he
 that holds in chase mine honour up and down
bastard my brother robert old sir robert's son
 colbrand the giant that same mighty man
 is it sir robert's son that you seek so
lady faulconbridge sir robert's son ay thou unreverend boy
 sir robert's son why scorn'st thou at sir robert
 he is sir robert's son and so art thou
bastard james gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile
gurney good leave good philip
bastard philip sparrow james
 there's toys abroad anon i'll tell thee more
 exit gurney
 madam i was not old sir robert's son
 sir robert might have eat his part in me
 upon goodfriday and ne'er broke his fast
 sir robert could do well marry to confess
 could he get me sir robert could not do it
 we know his handiwork therefore good mother
 to whom am i beholding for these limbs
 sir robert never holp to make this leg
lady faulconbridge hast thou conspired with thy brother too
 that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
 what means this scorn thou most untoward knave
bastard knight knight good mother basiliscolike
 what i am dubb'd i have it on my shoulder
 but mother i am not sir robert's son
 i have disclaim'd sir robert and my land
 legitimation name and all is gone
 then good my mother let me know my father
 some proper man i hope who was it mother
lady faulconbridge hast thou denied thyself a faulconbridge
bastard as faithfully as i deny the devil
lady faulconbridge king richard coeurdelion was thy father
 by long and vehement suit i was seduced
 to make room for him in my husband's bed
 heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
 thou art the issue of my dear offence
 which was so strongly urged past my defence
bastard now by this light were i to get again
 madam i would not wish a better father
 some sins do bear their privilege on earth
 and so doth yours your fault was not your folly
 needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
 subjected tribute to commanding love
 against whose fury and unmatched force
 the aweless lion could not wage the fight
 nor keep his princely heart from richard's hand
 he that perforce robs lions of their hearts
 may easily win a woman's ay my mother
 with all my heart i thank thee for my father
 who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
 when i was got i'll send his soul to hell
 come lady i will show thee to my kin
 and they shall say when richard me begot
 if thou hadst said him nay it had been sin
 who says it was he lies i say twas not

 on the other king philip and his power lewis
 arthur constance and attendants
lewis before angiers well met brave austria
 arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
 richard that robb'd the lion of his heart
 and fought the holy wars in palestine
 by this brave duke came early to his grave
 and for amends to his posterity
 at our importance hither is he come
 to spread his colours boy in thy behalf
 and to rebuke the usurpation
 of thy unnatural uncle english john
 embrace him love him give him welcome hither
arthur god shall forgive you coeurdelion's death
 the rather that you give his offspring life
 shadowing their right under your wings of war
 i give you welcome with a powerless hand
 but with a heart full of unstained love
 welcome before the gates of angiers duke
lewis a noble boy who would not do thee right
austria upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
 as seal to this indenture of my love
 that to my home i will no more return
 till angiers and the right thou hast in france
 together with that pale that whitefaced shore
 whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
 and coops from other lands her islanders
 even till that england hedged in with the main
 that waterwalled bulwark still secure
 and confident from foreign purposes
 even till that utmost corner of the west
 salute thee for her king till then fair boy
 will i not think of home but follow arms
constance o take his mother's thanks a widow's thanks
 till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
 to make a more requital to your love
austria the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
 in such a just and charitable war
king philip well then to work our cannon shall be bent
 against the brows of this resisting town
 call for our chiefest men of discipline
 to cull the plots of best advantages
 we'll lay before this town our royal bones
 wade to the marketplace in frenchmen's blood
 but we will make it subject to this boy
constance stay for an answer to your embassy
 lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood
 my lord chatillon may from england bring
 that right in peace which here we urge in war
 and then we shall repent each drop of blood
 that hot rash haste so indirectly shed
 enter chatillon
king philip a wonder lady lo upon thy wish
 our messenger chatillon is arrived
 what england says say briefly gentle lord
 we coldly pause for thee chatillon speak
chatillon then turn your forces from this paltry siege
 and stir them up against a mightier task
 england impatient of your just demands
 hath put himself in arms the adverse winds
 whose leisure i have stay'd have given him time
 to land his legions all as soon as i
 his marches are expedient to this town
 his forces strong his soldiers confident
 with him along is come the motherqueen
 an ate stirring him to blood and strife
 with her her niece the lady blanch of spain
 with them a bastard of the king's deceased
 and all the unsettled humours of the land
 rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
 with ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens
 have sold their fortunes at their native homes
 bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
 to make hazard of new fortunes here
 in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
 than now the english bottoms have waft o'er
 did nearer float upon the swelling tide
 to do offence and scath in christendom
 drum beats
 the interruption of their churlish drums
 cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
 to parley or to fight therefore prepare
king philip how much unlook'd for is this expedition
austria by how much unexpected by so much
 we must awake endavour for defence
 for courage mounteth with occasion
 let them be welcome then we are prepared
 enter king john queen elinor blanch the bastard
 lords and forces
king john peace be to france if france in peace permit
 our just and lineal entrance to our own
 if not bleed france and peace ascend to heaven
 whiles we god's wrathful agent do correct
 their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven
king philip peace be to england if that war return
 from france to england there to live in peace
 england we love and for that england's sake
 with burden of our armour here we sweat
 this toil of ours should be a work of thine
 but thou from loving england art so far
 that thou hast underwrought his lawful king
 cut off the sequence of posterity
 outfaced infant state and done a rape
 upon the maiden virtue of the crown
 look here upon thy brother geffrey's face
 these eyes these brows were moulded out of his
 this little abstract doth contain that large
 which died in geffrey and the hand of time
 shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
 that geffrey was thy elder brother born
 and this his son england was geffrey's right
 and this is geffrey's in the name of god
 how comes it then that thou art call'd a king
 when living blood doth in these temples beat
 which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest
king john from whom hast thou this great commission france
 to draw my answer from thy articles
king philip from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
 in any breast of strong authority
 to look into the blots and stains of right
 that judge hath made me guardian to this boy
 under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong
 and by whose help i mean to chastise it
king john alack thou dost usurp authority
king philip excuse it is to beat usurping down
queen elinor who is it thou dost call usurper france
constance let me make answer thy usurping son
queen elinor out insolent thy bastard shall be king
 that thou mayst be a queen and cheque the world
constance my bed was ever to thy son as true
 as thine was to thy husband and this boy
 liker in feature to his father geffrey
 than thou and john in manners being as like
 as rain to water or devil to his dam
 my boy a bastard by my soul i think
 his father never was so true begot
 it cannot be an if thou wert his mother
queen elinor there's a good mother boy that blots thy father
constance there's a good grandam boy that would blot thee
austria peace
bastard hear the crier
austria what the devil art thou
bastard one that will play the devil sir with you
 an a may catch your hide and you alone
 you are the hare of whom the proverb goes
 whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
 i'll smoke your skincoat an i catch you right
 sirrah look to't i faith i will i faith
blanch o well did he become that lion's robe
 that did disrobe the lion of that robe
bastard it lies as sightly on the back of him
 as great alcides shows upon an ass
 but ass i'll take that burthen from your back
 or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
austria what craker is this same that deafs our ears
 with this abundance of superfluous breath
king philip lewis determine what we shall do straight
lewis women and fools break off your conference
 king john this is the very sum of all
 england and ireland anjou touraine maine
 in right of arthur do i claim of thee
 wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
king john my life as soon i do defy thee france
 arthur of bretagne yield thee to my hand
 and out of my dear love i'll give thee more
 than e'er the coward hand of france can win
 submit thee boy
queen elinor come to thy grandam child
constance do child go to it grandam child
 give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
 give it a plum a cherry and a fig
 there's a good grandam
arthur good my mother peace
 i would that i were low laid in my grave
 i am not worth this coil that's made for me
queen elinor his mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
constance now shame upon you whether she does or no
 his grandam's wrongs and not his mother's shames
 draws those heavenmoving pearls from his poor eyes
 which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
 ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
 to do him justice and revenge on you
queen elinor thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
constance thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
 call not me slanderer thou and thine usurp
 the dominations royalties and rights
 of this oppressed boy this is thy eld'st son's son
 infortunate in nothing but in thee
 thy sins are visited in this poor child
 the canon of the law is laid on him
 being but the second generation
 removed from thy sinconceiving womb
king john bedlam have done
constance i have but this to say
 that he is not only plagued for her sin
 but god hath made her sin and her the plague
 on this removed issue plague for her
 and with her plague her sin his injury
 her injury the beadle to her sin
 all punish'd in the person of this child
 and all for her a plague upon her
queen elinor thou unadvised scold i can produce
 a will that bars the title of thy son
constance ay who doubts that a will a wicked will
 a woman's will a canker'd grandam's will
king philip peace lady pause or be more temperate
 it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
 to these illtuned repetitions
 some trumpet summon hither to the walls
 these men of angiers let us hear them speak
 whose title they admit arthur's or john's
 trumpet sounds enter certain citizens upon the walls
first citizen who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls
king philip tis france for england
king john england for itself
 you men of angiers and my loving subjects
king philip you loving men of angiers arthur's subjects
 our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle
king john for our advantage therefore hear us first
 these flags of france that are advanced here
 before the eye and prospect of your town
 have hither march'd to your endamagement
 the cannons have their bowels full of wrath
 and ready mounted are they to spit forth
 their iron indignation gainst your walls
 all preparation for a bloody siege
 all merciless proceeding by these french
 confronts your city's eyes your winking gates
 and but for our approach those sleeping stones
 that as a waist doth girdle you about
 by the compulsion of their ordinance
 by this time from their fixed beds of lime
 had been dishabited and wide havoc made
 for bloody power to rush upon your peace
 but on the sight of us your lawful king
 who painfully with much expedient march
 have brought a countercheque before your gates
 to save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks
 behold the french amazed vouchsafe a parle
 and now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire
 to make a shaking fever in your walls
 they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
 to make a faithless error in your ears
 which trust accordingly kind citizens
 and let us in your king whose labour'd spirits
 forwearied in this action of swift speed
 crave harbourage within your city walls
king philip when i have said make answer to us both
 lo in this right hand whose protection
 is most divinely vow'd upon the right
 of him it holds stands young plantagenet
 son to the elder brother of this man
 and king o'er him and all that he enjoys
 for this downtrodden equity we tread
 in warlike march these greens before your town
 being no further enemy to you
 than the constraint of hospitable zeal
 in the relief of this oppressed child
 religiously provokes be pleased then
 to pay that duty which you truly owe
 to that owes it namely this young prince
 and then our arms like to a muzzled bear
 save in aspect hath all offence seal'd up
 our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
 against the invulnerable clouds of heaven
 and with a blessed and unvex'd retire
 with unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised
 we will bear home that lusty blood again
 which here we came to spout against your town
 and leave your children wives and you in peace
 but if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer
 tis not the roundure of your oldfaced walls
 can hide you from our messengers of war
 though all these english and their discipline
 were harbour'd in their rude circumference
 then tell us shall your city call us lord
 in that behalf which we have challenged it
 or shall we give the signal to our rage
 and stalk in blood to our possession
first citizen in brief we are the king of england's subjects
 for him and in his right we hold this town
king john acknowledge then the king and let me in
first citizen that can we not but he that proves the king
 to him will we prove loyal till that time
 have we ramm'd up our gates against the world
king john doth not the crown of england prove the king
 and if not that i bring you witnesses
 twice fifteen thousand hearts of england's breed
bastard bastards and else
king john to verify our title with their lives
king philip as many and as wellborn bloods as those
bastard some bastards too
king philip stand in his face to contradict his claim
first citizen till you compound whose right is worthiest
 we for the worthiest hold the right from both
king john then god forgive the sin of all those souls
 that to their everlasting residence
 before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
 in dreadful trial of our kingdom's king
king philip amen amen mount chevaliers to arms
bastard saint george that swinged the dragon and e'er since
 sits on his horseback at mine hostess door
 teach us some fence
 to austria
 sirrah were i at home
 at your den sirrah with your lioness
 i would set an oxhead to your lion's hide
 and make a monster of you
austria peace no more
bastard o tremble for you hear the lion roar
king john up higher to the plain where we'll set forth
 in best appointment all our regiments
bastard speed then to take advantage of the field
king philip it shall be so and at the other hill
 command the rest to stand god and our right
 exeunt
 here after excursions enter the herald of france
 with trumpets to the gates
french herald you men of angiers open wide your gates
 and let young arthur duke of bretagne in
 who by the hand of france this day hath made
 much work for tears in many an english mother
 whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
 many a widow's husband grovelling lies
 coldly embracing the discolour'd earth
 and victory with little loss doth play
 upon the dancing banners of the french
 who are at hand triumphantly display'd
 to enter conquerors and to proclaim
 arthur of bretagne england's king and yours
 enter english herald with trumpet
english herald rejoice you men of angiers ring your bells
 king john your king and england's doth approach
 commander of this hot malicious day
 their armours that march'd hence so silverbright
 hither return all gilt with frenchmen's blood
 there stuck no plume in any english crest
 that is removed by a staff of france
 our colours do return in those same hands
 that did display them when we first march'd forth
 and like a troop of jolly huntsmen come
 our lusty english all with purpled hands
 dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes
 open your gates and gives the victors way
first citizen heralds from off our towers we might behold
 from first to last the onset and retire
 of both your armies whose equality
 by our best eyes cannot be censured
 blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows
 strength match'd with strength and power confronted power
 both are alike and both alike we like
 one must prove greatest while they weigh so even
 we hold our town for neither yet for both
 reenter king john and king philip with their
 powers severally
king john france hast thou yet more blood to cast away
 say shall the current of our right run on
 whose passage vex'd with thy impediment
 shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
 with course disturb'd even thy confining shores
 unless thou let his silver water keep
 a peaceful progress to the ocean
king philip england thou hast not saved one drop of blood
 in this hot trial more than we of france
 rather lost more and by this hand i swear
 that sways the earth this climate overlooks
 before we will lay down our justborne arms
 we'll put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
 or add a royal number to the dead
 gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
 with slaughter coupled to the name of kings
bastard ha majesty how high thy glory towers
 when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
 o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel
 the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
 and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
 in undetermined differences of kings
 why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
 cry havoc kings back to the stained field
 you equal potents fiery kindled spirits
 then let confusion of one part confirm
 the other's peace till then blows blood and death
king john whose party do the townsmen yet admit
king philip speak citizens for england who's your king
first citizen the king of england when we know the king
king philip know him in us that here hold up his right
king john in us that are our own great deputy
 and bear possession of our person here
 lord of our presence angiers and of you
first citizen a greater power then we denies all this
 and till it be undoubted we do lock
 our former scruple in our strongbarr'd gates
 king'd of our fears until our fears resolved
 be by some certain king purged and deposed
bastard by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings
 and stand securely on their battlements
 as in a theatre whence they gape and point
 at your industrious scenes and acts of death
 your royal presences be ruled by me
 do like the mutines of jerusalem
 be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
 your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
 by east and west let france and england mount
 their battering cannon charged to the mouths
 till their soulfearing clamours have brawl'd down
 the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
 i'ld play incessantly upon these jades
 even till unfenced desolation
 leave them as naked as the vulgar air
 that done dissever your united strengths
 and part your mingled colours once again
 turn face to face and bloody point to point
 then in a moment fortune shall cull forth
 out of one side her happy minion
 to whom in favour she shall give the day
 and kiss him with a glorious victory
 how like you this wild counsel mighty states
 smacks it not something of the policy
king john now by the sky that hangs above our heads
 i like it well france shall we knit our powers
 and lay this angiers even to the ground
 then after fight who shall be king of it
bastard an if thou hast the mettle of a king
 being wronged as we are by this peevish town
 turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
 as we will ours against these saucy walls
 and when that we have dash'd them to the ground
 why then defy each other and pellmell
 make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
king philip let it be so say where will you assault
king john we from the west will send destruction
 into this city's bosom
austria i from the north
king philip our thunder from the south
 shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
bastard o prudent discipline from north to south
 austria and france shoot in each other's mouth
 i'll stir them to it come away away
first citizen hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
 and i shall show you peace and fairfaced league
 win you this city without stroke or wound
 rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
 that here come sacrifices for the field
 persever not but hear me mighty kings
king john speak on with favour we are bent to hear
first citizen that daughter there of spain the lady blanch
 is niece to england look upon the years
 of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid
 if lusty love should go in quest of beauty
 where should he find it fairer than in blanch
 if zealous love should go in search of virtue
 where should he find it purer than in blanch
 if love ambitious sought a match of birth
 whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
 such as she is in beauty virtue birth
 is the young dauphin every way complete
 if not complete of say he is not she
 and she again wants nothing to name want
 if want it be not that she is not he
 he is the half part of a blessed man
 left to be finished by such as she
 and she a fair divided excellence
 whose fulness of perfection lies in him
 o two such silver currents when they join
 do glorify the banks that bound them in
 and two such shores to two such streams made one
 two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
 to these two princes if you marry them
 this union shall do more than battery can
 to our fastclosed gates for at this match
 with swifter spleen than powder can enforce
 the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
 and give you entrance but without this match
 the sea enraged is not half so deaf
 lions more confident mountains and rocks
 more free from motion no not death himself
 in moral fury half so peremptory
 as we to keep this city
bastard here's a stay
 that shakes the rotten carcass of old death
 out of his rags here's a large mouth indeed
 that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
 talks as familiarly of roaring lions
 as maids of thirteen do of puppydogs
 what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
 he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce
 he gives the bastinado with his tongue
 our ears are cudgell'd not a word of his
 but buffets better than a fist of france
 zounds i was never so bethump'd with words
 since i first call'd my brother's father dad
queen elinor son list to this conjunction make this match
 give with our niece a dowry large enough
 for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
 thy now unsured assurance to the crown
 that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
 the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
 i see a yielding in the looks of france
 mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
 are capable of this ambition
 lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
 of soft petitions pity and remorse
 cool and congeal again to what it was
first citizen why answer not the double majesties
 this friendly treaty of our threaten'd town
king philip speak england first that hath been forward first
 to speak unto this city what say you
king john if that the dauphin there thy princely son
 can in this book of beauty read i love'
 her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
 for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers
 and all that we upon this side the sea
 except this city now by us besieged
 find liable to our crown and dignity
 shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
 in titles honours and promotions
 as she in beauty education blood
 holds hand with any princess of the world
king philip what say'st thou boy look in the lady's face
lewis i do my lord and in her eye i find
 a wonder or a wondrous miracle
 the shadow of myself form'd in her eye
 which being but the shadow of your son
 becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
 i do protest i never loved myself
 till now infixed i beheld myself
 drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 whispers with blanch
bastard drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
 and quarter'd in her heart he doth espy
 himself love's traitor this is pity now
 that hang'd and drawn and quartered there should be
 in such a love so vile a lout as he
blanch my uncle's will in this respect is mine
 if he see aught in you that makes him like
 that any thing he sees which moves his liking
 i can with ease translate it to my will
 or if you will to speak more properly
 i will enforce it easily to my love
 further i will not flatter you my lord
 that all i see in you is worthy love
 than this that nothing do i see in you
 though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
 that i can find should merit any hate
king john what say these young ones what say you my niece
blanch that she is bound in honour still to do
 what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
king john speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady
lewis nay ask me if i can refrain from love
 for i do love her most unfeignedly
king john then do i give volquessen touraine maine
 poictiers and anjou these five provinces
 with her to thee and this addition more
 full thirty thousand marks of english coin
 philip of france if thou be pleased withal
 command thy son and daughter to join hands
king philip it likes us well young princes close your hands
austria and your lips too for i am well assured
 that i did so when i was first assured
king philip now citizens of angiers ope your gates
 let in that amity which you have made
 for at saint mary's chapel presently
 the rites of marriage shall be solemnized
 is not the lady constance in this troop
 i know she is not for this match made up
 her presence would have interrupted much
 where is she and her son tell me who knows
lewis she is sad and passionate at your highness tent
king philip and by my faith this league that we have made
 will give her sadness very little cure
 brother of england how may we content
 this widow lady in her right we came
 which we god knows have turn'd another way
 to our own vantage
king john we will heal up all
 for we'll create young arthur duke of bretagne
 and earl of richmond and this rich fair town
 we make him lord of call the lady constance
 some speedy messenger bid her repair
 to our solemnity i trust we shall
 if not fill up the measure of her will
 yet in some measure satisfy her so
 that we shall stop her exclamation
 go we as well as haste will suffer us
 to this unlook'd for unprepared pomp
 exeunt all but the bastard
bastard mad world mad kings mad composition
 john to stop arthur's title in the whole
 hath willingly departed with a part
 and france whose armour conscience buckled on
 whom zeal and charity brought to the field
 as god's own soldier rounded in the ear
 with that same purposechanger that sly devil
 that broker that still breaks the pate of faith
 that daily breakvow he that wins of all
 of kings of beggars old men young men maids
 who having no external thing to lose
 but the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
 that smoothfaced gentleman tickling commodity
 commodity the bias of the world
 the world who of itself is peised well
 made to run even upon even ground
 till this advantage this viledrawing bias
 this sway of motion this commodity
 makes it take head from all indifferency
 from all direction purpose course intent
 and this same bias this commodity
 this bawd this broker this allchanging word
 clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle france
 hath drawn him from his own determined aid
 from a resolved and honourable war
 to a most base and vileconcluded peace
 and why rail i on this commodity
 but for because he hath not woo'd me yet
 not that i have the power to clutch my hand
 when his fair angels would salute my palm
 but for my hand as unattempted yet
 like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
 well whiles i am a beggar i will rail
 and say there is no sin but to be rich
 and being rich my virtue then shall be
 to say there is no vice but beggary
 since kings break faith upon commodity
 gain be my lord for i will worship thee

act iii
scene i the french king's pavilion
 enter constance arthur and salisbury
constance gone to be married gone to swear a peace
 false blood to false blood join'd gone to be friends
 shall lewis have blanch and blanch those provinces
 it is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
 be well advised tell o'er thy tale again
 it cannot be thou dost but say tis so
 i trust i may not trust thee for thy word
 is but the vain breath of a common man
 believe me i do not believe thee man
 i have a king's oath to the contrary
 thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me
 for i am sick and capable of fears
 oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
 a widow husbandless subject to fears
 a woman naturally born to fears
 and though thou now confess thou didst but jest
 with my vex'd spirits i cannot take a truce
 but they will quake and tremble all this day
 what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
 why dost thou look so sadly on my son
 what means that hand upon that breast of thine
 why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
 like a proud river peering o'er his bounds
 be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
 then speak again not all thy former tale
 but this one word whether thy tale be true
salisbury as true as i believe you think them false
 that give you cause to prove my saying true
constance o if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
 teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
 and let belief and life encounter so
 as doth the fury of two desperate men
 which in the very meeting fall and die
 lewis marry blanch o boy then where art thou
 france friend with england what becomes of me
 fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight
 this news hath made thee a most ugly man
salisbury what other harm have i good lady done
 but spoke the harm that is by others done
constance which harm within itself so heinous is
 as it makes harmful all that speak of it
arthur i do beseech you madam be content
constance if thou that bid'st me be content wert grim
 ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb
 full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
 lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
 patch'd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks
 i would not care i then would be content
 for then i should not love thee no nor thou
 become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
 but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
 nature and fortune join'd to make thee great
 of nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
 and with the halfblown rose but fortune o
 she is corrupted changed and won from thee
 she adulterates hourly with thine uncle john
 and with her golden hand hath pluck'd on france
 to tread down fair respect of sovereignty
 and made his majesty the bawd to theirs
 france is a bawd to fortune and king john
 that strumpet fortune that usurping john
 tell me thou fellow is not france forsworn
 envenom him with words or get thee gone
 and leave those woes alone which i alone
 am bound to underbear
salisbury pardon me madam
 i may not go without you to the kings
constance thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee
 i will instruct my sorrows to be proud
 for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
 to me and to the state of my great grief
 let kings assemble for my grief's so great
 that no supporter but the huge firm earth
 can hold it up here i and sorrows sit
 here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
 seats herself on the ground
 enter king john king phillip lewis blanch
 queen elinor the bastard austria and attendants
king philip tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
 ever in france shall be kept festival
 to solemnize this day the glorious sun
 stays in his course and plays the alchemist
 turning with splendor of his precious eye
 the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
 the yearly course that brings this day about
 shall never see it but a holiday
constance a wicked day and not a holy day
 rising
 what hath this day deserved what hath it done
 that it in golden letters should be set
 among the high tides in the calendar
 nay rather turn this day out of the week
 this day of shame oppression perjury
 or if it must stand still let wives with child
 pray that their burthens may not fall this day
 lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd
 but on this day let seamen fear no wreck
 no bargains break that are not this day made
 this day all things begun come to ill end
 yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
king philip by heaven lady you shall have no cause
 to curse the fair proceedings of this day
 have i not pawn'd to you my majesty
constance you have beguiled me with a counterfeit
 resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried
 proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
 you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
 but now in arms you strengthen it with yours
 the grappling vigour and rough frown of war
 is cold in amity and painted peace
 and our oppression hath made up this league
 arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings
 a widow cries be husband to me heavens
 let not the hours of this ungodly day
 wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
 set armed discord twixt these perjured kings
 hear me o hear me
austria lady constance peace
constance war war no peace peace is to me a war
 o lymoges o austria thou dost shame
 that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward
 thou little valiant great in villany
 thou ever strong upon the stronger side
 thou fortune's champion that dost never fight
 but when her humorous ladyship is by
 to teach thee safety thou art perjured too
 and soothest up greatness what a fool art thou
 a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
 upon my party thou coldblooded slave
 hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
 been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
 upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
 and dost thou now fall over to my fores
 thou wear a lion's hide doff it for shame
 and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
austria o that a man should speak those words to me
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
austria thou darest not say so villain for thy life
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
king john we like not this thou dost forget thyself
 enter cardinal pandulph
king philip here comes the holy legate of the pope
cardinal pandulph hail you anointed deputies of heaven
 to thee king john my holy errand is
 i pandulph of fair milan cardinal
 and from pope innocent the legate here
 do in his name religiously demand
 why thou against the church our holy mother
 so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
 keep stephen langton chosen archbishop
 of canterbury from that holy see
 this in our foresaid holy father's name
 pope innocent i do demand of thee
king john what earthy name to interrogatories
 can task the free breath of a sacred king
 thou canst not cardinal devise a name
 so slight unworthy and ridiculous
 to charge me to an answer as the pope
 tell him this tale and from the mouth of england
 add thus much more that no italian priest
 shall tithe or toll in our dominions
 but as we under heaven are supreme head
 so under him that great supremacy
 where we do reign we will alone uphold
 without the assistance of a mortal hand
 so tell the pope all reverence set apart
 to him and his usurp'd authority
king philip brother of england you blaspheme in this
king john though you and all the kings of christendom
 are led so grossly by this meddling priest
 dreading the curse that money may buy out
 and by the merit of vile gold dross dust
 purchase corrupted pardon of a man
 who in that sale sells pardon from himself
 though you and all the rest so grossly led
 this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
 yet i alone alone do me oppose
 against the pope and count his friends my foes
cardinal pandulph then by the lawful power that i have
 thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate
 and blessed shall he be that doth revolt
 from his allegiance to an heretic
 and meritorious shall that hand be call'd
 canonized and worshipped as a saint
 that takes away by any secret course
 thy hateful life
constance o lawful let it be
 that i have room with rome to curse awhile
 good father cardinal cry thou amen
 to my keen curses for without my wrong
 there is no tongue hath power to curse him right
cardinal pandulph there's law and warrant lady for my curse
constance and for mine too when law can do no right
 let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
 law cannot give my child his kingdom here
 for he that holds his kingdom holds the law
 therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
 how can the law forbid my tongue to curse
cardinal pandulph philip of france on peril of a curse
 let go the hand of that archheretic
 and raise the power of france upon his head
 unless he do submit himself to rome
queen elinor look'st thou pale france do not let go thy hand
constance look to that devil lest that france repent
 and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
austria king philip listen to the cardinal
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on his recreant limbs
austria well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs because
bastard your breeches best may carry them
king john philip what say'st thou to the cardinal
constance what should he say but as the cardinal
lewis bethink you father for the difference
 is purchase of a heavy curse from rome
 or the light loss of england for a friend
 forego the easier
blanch that's the curse of rome
constance o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here
 in likeness of a new untrimmed bride
blanch the lady constance speaks not from her faith
 but from her need
constance o if thou grant my need
 which only lives but by the death of faith
 that need must needs infer this principle
 that faith would live again by death of need
 o then tread down my need and faith mounts up
 keep my need up and faith is trodden down
king john the king is moved and answers not to this
constance o be removed from him and answer well
austria do so king philip hang no more in doubt
bastard hang nothing but a calf'sskin most sweet lout
king philip i am perplex'd and know not what to say
cardinal pandulph what canst thou say but will perplex thee more
 if thou stand excommunicate and cursed
king philip good reverend father make my person yours
 and tell me how you would bestow yourself
 this royal hand and mine are newly knit
 and the conjunction of our inward souls
 married in league coupled and linked together
 with all religious strength of sacred vows
 the latest breath that gave the sound of words
 was deepsworn faith peace amity true love
 between our kingdoms and our royal selves
 and even before this truce but new before
 no longer than we well could wash our hands
 to clap this royal bargain up of peace
 heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstain'd
 with slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint
 the fearful difference of incensed kings
 and shall these hands so lately purged of blood
 so newly join'd in love so strong in both
 unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
 play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
 make such unconstant children of ourselves
 as now again to snatch our palm from palm
 unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed
 of smiling peace to march a bloody host
 and make a riot on the gentle brow
 of true sincerity o holy sir
 my reverend father let it not be so
 out of your grace devise ordain impose
 some gentle order and then we shall be blest
 to do your pleasure and continue friends
cardinal pandulph all form is formless order orderless
 save what is opposite to england's love
 therefore to arms be champion of our church
 or let the church our mother breathe her curse
 a mother's curse on her revolting son
 france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
 a chafed lion by the mortal paw
 a fasting tiger safer by the tooth
 than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
king philip i may disjoin my hand but not my faith
cardinal pandulph so makest thou faith an enemy to faith
 and like a civil war set'st oath to oath
 thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow
 first made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd
 that is to be the champion of our church
 what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
 and may not be performed by thyself
 for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
 is not amiss when it is truly done
 and being not done where doing tends to ill
 the truth is then most done not doing it
 the better act of purposes mistook
 is to mistake again though indirect
 yet indirection thereby grows direct
 and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire
 within the scorched veins of one newburn'd
 it is religion that doth make vows kept
 but thou hast sworn against religion
 by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st
 and makest an oath the surety for thy truth
 against an oath the truth thou art unsure
 to swear swears only not to be forsworn
 else what a mockery should it be to swear
 but thou dost swear only to be forsworn
 and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
 therefore thy later vows against thy first
 is in thyself rebellion to thyself
 and better conquest never canst thou make
 than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
 against these giddy loose suggestions
 upon which better part our prayers come in
 if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know
 the peril of our curses light on thee
 so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
 but in despair die under their black weight
austria rebellion flat rebellion
bastard will't not be
 will not a calfsskin stop that mouth of thine
lewis father to arms
blanch upon thy weddingday
 against the blood that thou hast married
 what shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men
 shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
 clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
 o husband hear me ay alack how new
 is husband in my mouth even for that name
 which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce
 upon my knee i beg go not to arms
 against mine uncle
constance o upon my knee
 made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee
 thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom
 forethought by heaven
blanch now shall i see thy love what motive may
 be stronger with thee than the name of wife
constance that which upholdeth him that thee upholds
 his honour o thine honour lewis thine honour
lewis i muse your majesty doth seem so cold
 when such profound respects do pull you on
cardinal pandulph i will denounce a curse upon his head
king philip thou shalt not need england i will fall from thee
constance o fair return of banish'd majesty
queen elinor o foul revolt of french inconstancy
king john france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
bastard old time the clocksetter that bald sexton time
 is it as he will well then france shall rue
blanch the sun's o'ercast with blood fair day adieu
 which is the side that i must go withal
 i am with both each army hath a hand
 and in their rage i having hold of both
 they swirl asunder and dismember me
 husband i cannot pray that thou mayst win
 uncle i needs must pray that thou mayst lose
 father i may not wish the fortune thine
 grandam i will not wish thy fortunes thrive
 whoever wins on that side shall i lose
 assured loss before the match be play'd
lewis lady with me with me thy fortune lies
blanch there where my fortune lives there my life dies
king john cousin go draw our puissance together
 exit bastard
 france i am burn'd up with inflaming wrath
 a rage whose heat hath this condition
 that nothing can allay nothing but blood
 the blood and dearestvalued blood of france

 to ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
 look to thyself thou art in jeopardy

 but i will fit it with some better time
 by heaven hubert i am almost ashamed
 to say what good respect i have of thee
hubert i am much bounden to your majesty
king john good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
 but thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow
 yet it shall come from me to do thee good
 i had a thing to say but let it go
 the sun is in the heaven and the proud day
 attended with the pleasures of the world
 is all too wanton and too full of gawds
 to give me audience if the midnight bell
 did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
 sound on into the drowsy race of night
 if this same were a churchyard where we stand
 and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
 or if that surly spirit melancholy
 had baked thy blood and made it heavythick
 which else runs tickling up and down the veins
 making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes
 and strain their cheeks to idle merriment
 a passion hateful to my purposes
 or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
 hear me without thine ears and make reply
 without a tongue using conceit alone
 without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
 then in despite of brooded watchful day
 i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
 but ah i will not yet i love thee well
 and by my troth i think thou lovest me well
hubert so well that what you bid me undertake
 though that my death were adjunct to my act
 by heaven i would do it
king john do not i know thou wouldst
 good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye
 on yon young boy i'll tell thee what my friend
 he is a very serpent in my way
 and whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread
 he lies before me dost thou understand me
 thou art his keeper
hubert and i'll keep him so
 that he shall not offend your majesty
king john death
hubert my lord
king john a grave
hubert he shall not live
king john enough
 i could be merry now hubert i love thee
 well i'll not say what i intend for thee
 remember madam fare you well
 i'll send those powers o'er to your majesty
elinor my blessing go with thee

 enter king philip lewis cardinal pandulph
 and attendants
king philip so by a roaring tempest on the flood
 a whole armado of convicted sail
 is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship
cardinal pandulph courage and comfort all shall yet go well
king philip what can go well when we have run so ill
 are we not beaten is not angiers lost
 arthur ta'en prisoner divers dear friends slain
 and bloody england into england gone
 o'erbearing interruption spite of france
lewis what he hath won that hath he fortified
 so hot a speed with such advice disposed
 such temperate order in so fierce a cause
 doth want example who hath read or heard
 of any kindred action like to this
king philip well could i bear that england had this praise
 so we could find some pattern of our shame
 enter constance
 look who comes here a grave unto a soul
 holding the eternal spirit against her will
 in the vile prison of afflicted breath
 i prithee lady go away with me
constance lo now i now see the issue of your peace
king philip patience good lady comfort gentle constance
constance no i defy all counsel all redress
 but that which ends all counsel true redress
 death death o amiable lovely death
 thou odouriferous stench sound rottenness
 arise forth from the couch of lasting night
 thou hate and terror to prosperity
 and i will kiss thy detestable bones
 and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
 and ring these fingers with thy household worms
 and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
 and be a carrion monster like thyself
 come grin on me and i will think thou smilest
 and buss thee as thy wife misery's love
 o come to me
king philip o fair affliction peace
constance no no i will not having breath to cry
 o that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth
 then with a passion would i shake the world
 and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
 which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice
 which scorns a modern invocation
cardinal pandulph lady you utter madness and not sorrow
constance thou art not holy to belie me so
 i am not mad this hair i tear is mine
 my name is constance i was geffrey's wife
 young arthur is my son and he is lost
 i am not mad i would to heaven i were
 for then tis like i should forget myself
 o if i could what grief should i forget
 preach some philosophy to make me mad
 and thou shalt be canonized cardinal
 for being not mad but sensible of grief
 my reasonable part produces reason
 how i may be deliver'd of these woes
 and teaches me to kill or hang myself
 if i were mad i should forget my son
 or madly think a babe of clouts were he
 i am not mad too well too well i feel
 the different plague of each calamity
king philip bind up those tresses o what love i note
 in the fair multitude of those her hairs
 where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen
 even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
 do glue themselves in sociable grief
 like true inseparable faithful loves
 sticking together in calamity
constance to england if you will
king philip bind up your hairs
constance yes that i will and wherefore will i do it
 i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
 o that these hands could so redeem my son
 as they have given these hairs their liberty'
 but now i envy at their liberty
 and will again commit them to their bonds
 because my poor child is a prisoner
 and father cardinal i have heard you say
 that we shall see and know our friends in heaven
 if that be true i shall see my boy again
 for since the birth of cain the first male child
 to him that did but yesterday suspire
 there was not such a gracious creature born
 but now will cankersorrow eat my bud
 and chase the native beauty from his cheek
 and he will look as hollow as a ghost
 as dim and meagre as an ague's fit
 and so he'll die and rising so again
 when i shall meet him in the court of heaven
 i shall not know him therefore never never
 must i behold my pretty arthur more
cardinal pandulph you hold too heinous a respect of grief
constance he talks to me that never had a son
king philip you are as fond of grief as of your child
constance grief fills the room up of my absent child
 lies in his bed walks up and down with me
 puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
 remembers me of all his gracious parts
 stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
 then have i reason to be fond of grief
 fare you well had you such a loss as i
 i could give better comfort than you do
 i will not keep this form upon my head
 when there is such disorder in my wit
 o lord my boy my arthur my fair son
 my life my joy my food my all the world
 my widowcomfort and my sorrows cure
 exit
king philip i fear some outrage and i'll follow her
 exit
lewis there's nothing in this world can make me joy
 life is as tedious as a twicetold tale
 vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
 and bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
 that it yields nought but shame and bitterness
cardinal pandulph before the curing of a strong disease
 even in the instant of repair and health
 the fit is strongest evils that take leave
 on their departure most of all show evil
 what have you lost by losing of this day
lewis all days of glory joy and happiness
cardinal pandulph if you had won it certainly you had
 no no when fortune means to men most good
 she looks upon them with a threatening eye
 tis strange to think how much king john hath lost
 in this which he accounts so clearly won
 are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner
lewis as heartily as he is glad he hath him
cardinal pandulph your mind is all as youthful as your blood
 now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
 for even the breath of what i mean to speak
 shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
 out of the path which shall directly lead
 thy foot to england's throne and therefore mark
 john hath seized arthur and it cannot be
 that whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins
 the misplaced john should entertain an hour
 one minute nay one quiet breath of rest
 a sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
 must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd
 and he that stands upon a slippery place
 makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
 that john may stand then arthur needs must fall
 so be it for it cannot be but so
lewis but what shall i gain by young arthur's fall
cardinal pandulph you in the right of lady blanch your wife
 may then make all the claim that arthur did
lewis and lose it life and all as arthur did
cardinal pandulph how green you are and fresh in this old world
 john lays you plots the times conspire with you
 for he that steeps his safety in true blood
 shall find but bloody safety and untrue
 this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
 of all his people and freeze up their zeal
 that none so small advantage shall step forth
 to cheque his reign but they will cherish it
 no natural exhalation in the sky
 no scope of nature no distemper'd day
 no common wind no customed event
 but they will pluck away his natural cause
 and call them meteors prodigies and signs
 abortives presages and tongues of heaven
 plainly denouncing vengeance upon john
lewis may be he will not touch young arthur's life
 but hold himself safe in his prisonment
cardinal pandulph o sir when he shall hear of your approach
 if that young arthur be not gone already
 even at that news he dies and then the hearts
 of all his people shall revolt from him
 and kiss the lips of unacquainted change
 and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
 out of the bloody fingers ends of john
 methinks i see this hurly all on foot
 and o what better matter breeds for you
 than i have named the bastard faulconbridge
 is now in england ransacking the church
 offending charity if but a dozen french
 were there in arms they would be as a call
 to train ten thousand english to their side
 or as a little snow tumbled about
 anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin
 go with me to the king tis wonderful
 what may be wrought out of their discontent
 now that their souls are topful of offence
 for england go i will whet on the king
lewis strong reasons make strong actions let us go
 if you say ay the king will not say no

act iv
scene i a room in a castle
 enter hubert and executioners
hubert heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
 within the arras when i strike my foot
 upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
 and bind the boy which you shall find with me
 fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch
first executioner i hope your warrant will bear out the deed
hubert uncleanly scruples fear not you look to't
 exeunt executioners
 young lad come forth i have to say with you
 enter arthur
arthur good morrow hubert
hubert good morrow little prince
arthur as little prince having so great a title
 to be more prince as may be you are sad
hubert indeed i have been merrier
arthur mercy on me
 methinks no body should be sad but i
 yet i remember when i was in france
 young gentlemen would be as sad as night
 only for wantonness by my christendom
 so i were out of prison and kept sheep
 i should be as merry as the day is long
 and so i would be here but that i doubt
 my uncle practises more harm to me
 he is afraid of me and i of him
 is it my fault that i was geffrey's son
 no indeed is't not and i would to heaven
 i were your son so you would love me hubert
hubert aside if i talk to him with his innocent prate
 he will awake my mercy which lies dead
 therefore i will be sudden and dispatch
arthur are you sick hubert you look pale today
 in sooth i would you were a little sick
 that i might sit all night and watch with you
 i warrant i love you more than you do me
hubert aside his words do take possession of my bosom
 read here young arthur
 showing a paper
 aside
 how now foolish rheum
 turning dispiteous torture out of door
 i must be brief lest resolution drop
 out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
 can you not read it is it not fair writ
arthur too fairly hubert for so foul effect
 must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
hubert young boy i must
arthur and will you
hubert and i will
arthur have you the heart when your head did but ache
 i knit my handercher about your brows
 the best i had a princess wrought it me
 and i did never ask it you again
 and with my hand at midnight held your head
 and like the watchful minutes to the hour
 still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time
 saying what lack you and where lies your grief'
 or what good love may i perform for you'
 many a poor man's son would have lien still
 and ne'er have spoke a loving word to you
 but you at your sick service had a prince
 nay you may think my love was crafty love
 and call it cunning do an if you will
 if heaven be pleased that you must use me ill
 why then you must will you put out mine eyes
 these eyes that never did nor never shall
 so much as frown on you
hubert i have sworn to do it
 and with hot irons must i burn them out
arthur ah none but in this iron age would do it
 the iron of itself though heat redhot
 approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
 and quench his fiery indignation
 even in the matter of mine innocence
 nay after that consume away in rust
 but for containing fire to harm mine eye
 are you more stubbornhard than hammer'd iron
 an if an angel should have come to me
 and told me hubert should put out mine eyes
 i would not have believed himno tongue but hubert's
hubert come forth
 stamps
 reenter executioners with a cord irons &c
 do as i bid you do
arthur o save me hubert save me my eyes are out
 even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
hubert give me the iron i say and bind him here
arthur alas what need you be so boisterousrough
 i will not struggle i will stand stonestill
 for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound
 nay hear me hubert drive these men away
 and i will sit as quiet as a lamb
 i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
 nor look upon the iron angerly
 thrust but these men away and i'll forgive you
 whatever torment you do put me to
hubert go stand within let me alone with him
first executioner i am best pleased to be from such a deed
 exeunt executioners
arthur alas i then have chid away my friend
 he hath a stern look but a gentle heart
 let him come back that his compassion may
 give life to yours
hubert come boy prepare yourself
arthur is there no remedy
hubert none but to lose your eyes
arthur o heaven that there were but a mote in yours
 a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
 any annoyance in that precious sense
 then feeling what small things are boisterous there
 your vile intent must needs seem horrible
hubert is this your promise go to hold your tongue
arthur hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
 must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
 let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert
 or hubert if you will cut out my tongue
 so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes
 though to no use but still to look on you
 lo by my truth the instrument is cold
 and would not harm me
hubert i can heat it boy
arthur no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
 being create for comfort to be used
 in undeserved extremes see else yourself
 there is no malice in this burning coal
 the breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
 and strew'd repentent ashes on his head
hubert but with my breath i can revive it boy
arthur an if you do you will but make it blush
 and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert
 nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
 and like a dog that is compell'd to fight
 snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
 all things that you should use to do me wrong
 deny their office only you do lack
 that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
 creatures of note for mercylacking uses
hubert well see to live i will not touch thine eye
 for all the treasure that thine uncle owes
 yet am i sworn and i did purpose boy
 with this same very iron to burn them out
arthur o now you look like hubert all this while
 you were disguised
hubert peace no more adieu
 your uncle must not know but you are dead
 i'll fill these dogged spies with false reports
 and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
 that hubert for the wealth of all the world
 will not offend thee
arthur o heaven i thank you hubert
hubert silence no more go closely in with me
 much danger do i undergo for thee
 exeunt
 king john
act iv
scene ii king john's palace
 enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords
king john here once again we sit once again crown'd
 and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes
pembroke this once again but that your highness pleased
 was once superfluous you were crown'd before
 and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off
 the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt
 fresh expectation troubled not the land
 with any long'dfor change or better state
salisbury therefore to be possess'd with double pomp
 to guard a title that was rich before
 to gild refined gold to paint the lily
 to throw a perfume on the violet
 to smooth the ice or add another hue
 unto the rainbow or with taperlight
 to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
 is wasteful and ridiculous excess
pembroke but that your royal pleasure must be done
 this act is as an ancient tale new told
 and in the last repeating troublesome
 being urged at a time unseasonable
salisbury in this the antique and well noted face
 of plain old form is much disfigured
 and like a shifted wind unto a sail
 it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
 startles and frights consideration
 makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
 for putting on so new a fashion'd robe
pembroke when workmen strive to do better than well
 they do confound their skill in covetousness
 and oftentimes excusing of a fault
 doth make the fault the worse by the excuse
 as patches set upon a little breach
 discredit more in hiding of the fault
 than did the fault before it was so patch'd
salisbury to this effect before you were new crown'd
 we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness
 to overbear it and we are all well pleased
 since all and every part of what we would
 doth make a stand at what your highness will
king john some reasons of this double coronation
 i have possess'd you with and think them strong
 and more more strong then lesser is my fear
 i shall indue you with meantime but ask
 what you would have reform'd that is not well
 and well shall you perceive how willingly
 i will both hear and grant you your requests
pembroke then i as one that am the tongue of these
 to sound the purpose of all their hearts
 both for myself and them but chief of all
 your safety for the which myself and them
 bend their best studies heartily request
 the enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint
 doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
 to break into this dangerous argument
 if what in rest you have in right you hold
 why then your fears which as they say attend
 the steps of wrong should move you to mew up
 your tender kinsman and to choke his days
 with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
 the rich advantage of good exercise
 that the time's enemies may not have this
 to grace occasions let it be our suit
 that you have bid us ask his liberty
 which for our goods we do no further ask
 than whereupon our weal on you depending
 counts it your weal he have his liberty
 enter hubert
king john let it be so i do commit his youth
 to your direction hubert what news with you
 taking him apart
pembroke this is the man should do the bloody deed
 he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine
 the image of a wicked heinous fault
 lives in his eye that close aspect of his
 does show the mood of a much troubled breast
 and i do fearfully believe tis done
 what we so fear'd he had a charge to do
salisbury the colour of the king doth come and go
 between his purpose and his conscience
 like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
 his passion is so ripe it needs must break
pembroke and when it breaks i fear will issue thence
 the foul corruption of a sweet child's death
king john we cannot hold mortality's strong hand
 good lords although my will to give is living
 the suit which you demand is gone and dead
 he tells us arthur is deceased tonight
salisbury indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure
pembroke indeed we heard how near his death he was
 before the child himself felt he was sick
 this must be answer'd either here or hence
king john why do you bend such solemn brows on me
 think you i bear the shears of destiny
 have i commandment on the pulse of life
salisbury it is apparent foul play and tis shame
 that greatness should so grossly offer it
 so thrive it in your game and so farewell
pembroke stay yet lord salisbury i'll go with thee
 and find the inheritance of this poor child
 his little kingdom of a forced grave
 that blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
 three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
 this must not be thus borne this will break out
 to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt
 exeunt lords
king john they burn in indignation i repent
 there is no sure foundation set on blood
 no certain life achieved by others death
 enter a messenger
 a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
 that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks
 so foul a sky clears not without a storm
 pour down thy weather how goes all in france
messenger from france to england never such a power
 for any foreign preparation
 was levied in the body of a land
 the copy of your speed is learn'd by them
 for when you should be told they do prepare
 the tidings come that they are all arrived
king john o where hath our intelligence been drunk
 where hath it slept where is my mother's care
 that such an army could be drawn in france
 and she not hear of it
messenger my liege her ear
 is stopp'd with dust the first of april died
 your noble mother and as i hear my lord
 the lady constance in a frenzy died
 three days before but this from rumour's tongue
 i idly heard if true or false i know not
king john withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
 o make a league with me till i have pleased
 my discontented peers what mother dead
 how wildly then walks my estate in france
 under whose conduct came those powers of france
 that thou for truth givest out are landed here
messenger under the dauphin
king john thou hast made me giddy
 with these ill tidings
 enter the bastard and peter of pomfret
 now what says the world
 to your proceedings do not seek to stuff
 my head with more ill news for it is full
bastard but if you be afeard to hear the worst
 then let the worst unheard fall on your bead
king john bear with me cousin for i was amazed
 under the tide but now i breathe again
 aloft the flood and can give audience
 to any tongue speak it of what it will
bastard how i have sped among the clergymen
 the sums i have collected shall express
 but as i travell'd hither through the land
 i find the people strangely fantasied
 possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams
 not knowing what they fear but full of fear
 and here a prophet that i brought with me
 from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found
 with many hundreds treading on his heels
 to whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes
 that ere the next ascensionday at noon
 your highness should deliver up your crown
king john thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
peter foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
king john hubert away with him imprison him
 and on that day at noon whereon he says
 i shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd
 deliver him to safety and return
 for i must use thee
 exeunt hubert with peter
 o my gentle cousin
 hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived
bastard the french my lord men's mouths are full of it
 besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury
 with eyes as red as newenkindled fire
 and others more going to seek the grave
 of arthur who they say is kill'd tonight
 on your suggestion
king john gentle kinsman go
 and thrust thyself into their companies
 i have a way to win their loves again
 bring them before me
bastard i will seek them out
king john nay but make haste the better foot before
 o let me have no subject enemies
 when adverse foreigners affright my towns
 with dreadful pomp of stout invasion
 be mercury set feathers to thy heels
 and fly like thought from them to me again
bastard the spirit of the time shall teach me speed
 exit
king john spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
 go after him for he perhaps shall need
 some messenger betwixt me and the peers
 and be thou he
messenger with all my heart my liege
 exit
king john my mother dead
 reenter hubert
hubert my lord they say five moons were seen tonight
 four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
 the other four in wondrous motion
king john five moons
hubert old men and beldams in the streets
 do prophesy upon it dangerously
 young arthur's death is common in their mouths
 and when they talk of him they shake their heads
 and whisper one another in the ear
 and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist
 whilst he that hears makes fearful action
 with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
 i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
 the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
 with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news
 who with his shears and measure in his hand
 standing on slippers which his nimble haste
 had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
 told of a many thousand warlike french
 that were embattailed and rank'd in kent
 another lean unwash'd artificer
 cuts off his tale and talks of arthur's death
king john why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears
 why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death
 thy hand hath murder'd him i had a mighty cause
 to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
hubert no had my lord why did you not provoke me
king john it is the curse of kings to be attended
 by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
 to break within the bloody house of life
 and on the winking of authority
 to understand a law to know the meaning
 of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
 more upon humour than advised respect
hubert here is your hand and seal for what i did
king john o when the last account twixt heaven and earth
 is to be made then shall this hand and seal
 witness against us to damnation
 how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
 make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by
 a fellow by the hand of nature mark'd
 quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame
 this murder had not come into my mind
 but taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect
 finding thee fit for bloody villany
 apt liable to be employ'd in danger
 i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death
 and thou to be endeared to a king
 made it no conscience to destroy a prince
hubert my lord
king john hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
 when i spake darkly what i purposed
 or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face
 as bid me tell my tale in express words
 deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
 and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
 but thou didst understand me by my signs
 and didst in signs again parley with sin
 yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
 and consequently thy rude hand to act
 the deed which both our tongues held vile to name
 out of my sight and never see me more
 my nobles leave me and my state is braved
 even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers
 nay in the body of this fleshly land
 this kingdom this confine of blood and breath
 hostility and civil tumult reigns
 between my conscience and my cousin's death
hubert arm you against your other enemies
 i'll make a peace between your soul and you
 young arthur is alive this hand of mine
 is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
 not painted with the crimson spots of blood
 within this bosom never enter'd yet
 the dreadful motion of a murderous thought
 and you have slander'd nature in my form
 which howsoever rude exteriorly
 is yet the cover of a fairer mind
 than to be butcher of an innocent child
king john doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers
 throw this report on their incensed rage
 and make them tame to their obedience
 forgive the comment that my passion made
 upon thy feature for my rage was blind
 and foul imaginary eyes of blood
 presented thee more hideous than thou art
 o answer not but to my closet bring
 the angry lords with all expedient haste
 i conjure thee but slowly run more fast
 exeunt

act iv
scene iii before the castle
 enter arthur on the walls
arthur the wall is high and yet will i leap down
 good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
 there's few or none do know me if they did
 this shipboy's semblance hath disguised me quite
 i am afraid and yet i'll venture it
 if i get down and do not break my limbs
 i'll find a thousand shifts to get away
 as good to die and go as die and stay
 leaps down
 o me my uncle's spirit is in these stones
 heaven take my soul and england keep my bones
 dies
 enter pembroke salisbury and bigot
salisbury lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury
 it is our safety and we must embrace
 this gentle offer of the perilous time
pembroke who brought that letter from the cardinal
salisbury the count melun a noble lord of france
 whose private with me of the dauphin's love
 is much more general than these lines import
bigot tomorrow morning let us meet him then
salisbury or rather then set forward for twill be
 two long days journey lords or ere we meet
 enter the bastard
bastard once more today well met distemper'd lords
 the king by me requests your presence straight
salisbury the king hath dispossess'd himself of us
 we will not line his thin bestained cloak
 with our pure honours nor attend the foot
 that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks
 return and tell him so we know the worst
bastard whate'er you think good words i think were best
salisbury our griefs and not our manners reason now
bastard but there is little reason in your grief
 therefore twere reason you had manners now
pembroke sir sir impatience hath his privilege
bastard tis true to hurt his master no man else
salisbury this is the prison what is he lies here
 seeing arthur
pembroke o death made proud with pure and princely beauty
 the earth had not a hole to hide this deed
salisbury murder as hating what himself hath done
 doth lay it open to urge on revenge
bigot or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave
 found it too preciousprincely for a grave
salisbury sir richard what think you have you beheld
 or have you read or heard or could you think
 or do you almost think although you see
 that you do see could thought without this object
 form such another this is the very top
 the height the crest or crest unto the crest
 of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame
 the wildest savagery the vilest stroke
 that ever walleyed wrath or staring rage
 presented to the tears of soft remorse
pembroke all murders past do stand excused in this
 and this so sole and so unmatchable
 shall give a holiness a purity
 to the yet unbegotten sin of times
 and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
 exampled by this heinous spectacle
bastard it is a damned and a bloody work
 the graceless action of a heavy hand
 if that it be the work of any hand
salisbury if that it be the work of any hand
 we had a kind of light what would ensue
 it is the shameful work of hubert's hand
 the practise and the purpose of the king
 from whose obedience i forbid my soul
 kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
 and breathing to his breathless excellence
 the incense of a vow a holy vow
 never to taste the pleasures of the world
 never to be infected with delight
 nor conversant with ease and idleness
 till i have set a glory to this hand
 by giving it the worship of revenge
pembroke 
 our souls religiously confirm thy words
bigot 
 enter hubert
hubert lords i am hot with haste in seeking you
 arthur doth live the king hath sent for you
salisbury o he is old and blushes not at death
 avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
hubert i am no villain
salisbury must i rob the law
 drawing his sword
bastard your sword is bright sir put it up again
salisbury not till i sheathe it in a murderer's skin
hubert stand back lord salisbury stand back i say
 by heaven i think my sword's as sharp as yours
 i would not have you lord forget yourself
 nor tempt the danger of my true defence
 lest i by marking of your rage forget
 your worth your greatness and nobility
bigot out dunghill darest thou brave a nobleman
hubert not for my life but yet i dare defend
 my innocent life against an emperor
salisbury thou art a murderer
hubert do not prove me so
 yet i am none whose tongue soe'er speaks false
 not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
pembroke cut him to pieces
bastard keep the peace i say
salisbury stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge
bastard thou wert better gall the devil salisbury
 if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
 or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
 i'll strike thee dead put up thy sword betime
 or i'll so maul you and your toastingiron
 that you shall think the devil is come from hell
bigot what wilt thou do renowned faulconbridge
 second a villain and a murderer
hubert lord bigot i am none
bigot who kill'd this prince
hubert tis not an hour since i left him well
 i honour'd him i loved him and will weep
 my date of life out for his sweet life's loss
salisbury trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
 for villany is not without such rheum
 and he long traded in it makes it seem
 like rivers of remorse and innocency
 away with me all you whose souls abhor
 the uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse
 for i am stifled with this smell of sin
bigot away toward bury to the dauphin there
pembroke there tell the king he may inquire us out
 exeunt lords
bastard here's a good world knew you of this fair work
 beyond the infinite and boundless reach
 of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
 art thou damn'd hubert
hubert do but hear me sir
bastard ha i'll tell thee what
 thou'rt damn'd as blacknay nothing is so black
 thou art more deep damn'd than prince lucifer
 there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
 as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
hubert upon my soul
bastard if thou didst but consent
 to this most cruel act do but despair
 and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread
 that ever spider twisted from her womb
 will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
 to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
 put but a little water in a spoon
 and it shall be as all the ocean
 enough to stifle such a villain up
 i do suspect thee very grievously
hubert if i in act consent or sin of thought
 be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
 which was embounded in this beauteous clay
 let hell want pains enough to torture me
 i left him well
bastard go bear him in thine arms
 i am amazed methinks and lose my way
 among the thorns and dangers of this world
 how easy dost thou take all england up
 from forth this morsel of dead royalty
 the life the right and truth of all this realm
 is fled to heaven and england now is left
 to tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
 the unowed interest of proudswelling state
 now for the barepick'd bone of majesty
 doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
 and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
 now powers from home and discontents at home
 meet in one line and vast confusion waits
 as doth a raven on a sickfall'n beast
 the imminent decay of wrested pomp
 now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
 hold out this tempest bear away that child
 and follow me with speed i'll to the king
 a thousand businesses are brief in hand
 and heaven itself doth frown upon the land

 from this my hand as holding of the pope
 your sovereign greatness and authority
king john now keep your holy word go meet the french
 and from his holiness use all your power
 to stop their marches fore we are inflamed
 our discontented counties do revolt
 our people quarrel with obedience
 swearing allegiance and the love of soul
 to stranger blood to foreign royalty
 this inundation of mistemper'd humour
 rests by you only to be qualified
 then pause not for the present time's so sick
 that present medicine must be minister'd
 or overthrow incurable ensues
cardinal pandulph it was my breath that blew this tempest up
 upon your stubborn usage of the pope
 but since you are a gentle convertite
 my tongue shall hush again this storm of war
 and make fair weather in your blustering land
 on this ascensionday remember well
 upon your oath of service to the pope
 go i to make the french lay down their arms
 exit
king john is this ascensionday did not the prophet
 say that before ascensionday at noon
 my crown i should give off even so i have
 i did suppose it should be on constraint
 but heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary
 enter the bastard
bastard all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
 but dover castle london hath received
 like a kind host the dauphin and his powers
 your nobles will not hear you but are gone
 to offer service to your enemy
 and wild amazement hurries up and down
 the little number of your doubtful friends
king john would not my lords return to me again
 after they heard young arthur was alive
bastard they found him dead and cast into the streets
 an empty casket where the jewel of life
 by some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away
king john that villain hubert told me he did live
bastard so on my soul he did for aught he knew
 but wherefore do you droop why look you sad
 be great in act as you have been in thought
 let not the world see fear and sad distrust
 govern the motion of a kingly eye
 be stirring as the time be fire with fire
 threaten the threatener and outface the brow
 of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
 that borrow their behaviors from the great
 grow great by your example and put on
 the dauntless spirit of resolution
 away and glister like the god of war
 when he intendeth to become the field
 show boldness and aspiring confidence
 what shall they seek the lion in his den
 and fright him there and make him tremble there
 o let it not be said forage and run
 to meet displeasure farther from the doors
 and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh
king john the legate of the pope hath been with me
 and i have made a happy peace with him
 and he hath promised to dismiss the powers
 led by the dauphin
bastard o inglorious league
 shall we upon the footing of our land
 send fairplay orders and make compromise
 insinuation parley and base truce
 to arms invasive shall a beardless boy
 a cocker'd silken wanton brave our fields
 and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
 mocking the air with colours idly spread
 and find no cheque let us my liege to arms
 perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
 or if he do let it at least be said
 they saw we had a purpose of defence
king john have thou the ordering of this present time
bastard away then with good courage yet i know
 our party may well meet a prouder foe

scene ii lewis's camp at st edmundsbury
 enter in arms lewis salisbury melun pembroke
 bigot and soldiers
lewis my lord melun let this be copied out
 and keep it safe for our remembrance
 return the precedent to these lords again
 that having our fair order written down
 both they and we perusing o'er these notes
 may know wherefore we took the sacrament
 and keep our faiths firm and inviolable
salisbury upon our sides it never shall be broken
 and noble dauphin albeit we swear
 a voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
 to your proceedings yet believe me prince
 i am not glad that such a sore of time
 should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt
 and heal the inveterate canker of one wound
 by making many o it grieves my soul
 that i must draw this metal from my side
 to be a widowmaker o and there
 where honourable rescue and defence
 cries out upon the name of salisbury
 but such is the infection of the time
 that for the health and physic of our right
 we cannot deal but with the very hand
 of stern injustice and confused wrong
 and is't not pity o my grieved friends
 that we the sons and children of this isle
 were born to see so sad an hour as this
 wherein we step after a stranger march
 upon her gentle bosom and fill up
 her enemies ranksi must withdraw and weep
 upon the spot of this enforced cause
 to grace the gentry of a land remote
 and follow unacquainted colours here
 what here o nation that thou couldst remove
 that neptune's arms who clippeth thee about
 would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
 and grapple thee unto a pagan shore
 where these two christian armies might combine
 the blood of malice in a vein of league
 and not to spend it so unneighbourly
lewis a noble temper dost thou show in this
 and great affections wrestling in thy bosom
 doth make an earthquake of nobility
 o what a noble combat hast thou fought
 between compulsion and a brave respect
 let me wipe off this honourable dew
 that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
 my heart hath melted at a lady's tears
 being an ordinary inundation
 but this effusion of such manly drops
 this shower blown up by tempest of the soul
 startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed
 than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven
 figured quite o'er with burning meteors
 lift up thy brow renowned salisbury
 and with a great heart heave away the storm
 commend these waters to those baby eyes
 that never saw the giant world enraged
 nor met with fortune other than at feasts
 full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
 come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
 into the purse of rich prosperity
 as lewis himself so nobles shall you all
 that knit your sinews to the strength of mine
 and even there methinks an angel spake
 enter cardinal pandulph
 look where the holy legate comes apace
 to give us warrant from the hand of heaven
 and on our actions set the name of right
 with holy breath
cardinal pandulph hail noble prince of france
 the next is this king john hath reconciled
 himself to rome his spirit is come in
 that so stood out against the holy church
 the great metropolis and see of rome
 therefore thy threatening colours now wind up
 and tame the savage spirit of wild war
 that like a lion foster'd up at hand
 it may lie gently at the foot of peace
 and be no further harmful than in show
lewis your grace shall pardon me i will not back
 i am too highborn to be propertied
 to be a secondary at control
 or useful servingman and instrument
 to any sovereign state throughout the world
 your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
 between this chastised kingdom and myself
 and brought in matter that should feed this fire
 and now tis far too huge to be blown out
 with that same weak wind which enkindled it
 you taught me how to know the face of right
 acquainted me with interest to this land
 yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
 and come ye now to tell me john hath made
 his peace with rome what is that peace to me
 i by the honour of my marriagebed
 after young arthur claim this land for mine
 and now it is halfconquer'd must i back
 because that john hath made his peace with rome
 am i rome's slave what penny hath rome borne
 what men provided what munition sent
 to underprop this action is't not i
 that undergo this charge who else but i
 and such as to my claim are liable
 sweat in this business and maintain this war
 have i not heard these islanders shout out
 vive le roi as i have bank'd their towns
 have i not here the best cards for the game
 to win this easy match play'd for a crown
 and shall i now give o'er the yielded set
 no no on my soul it never shall be said
cardinal pandulph you look but on the outside of this work
lewis outside or inside i will not return
 till my attempt so much be glorified
 as to my ample hope was promised
 before i drew this gallant head of war
 and cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
 to outlook conquest and to win renown
 even in the jaws of danger and of death
 trumpet sounds
 what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
 enter the bastard attended
bastard according to the fair play of the world
 let me have audience i am sent to speak
 my holy lord of milan from the king
 i come to learn how you have dealt for him
 and as you answer i do know the scope
 and warrant limited unto my tongue
cardinal pandulph the dauphin is too wilfulopposite
 and will not temporize with my entreaties
 he flatly says he'll not lay down his arms
bastard by all the blood that ever fury breathed
 the youth says well now hear our english king
 for thus his royalty doth speak in me
 he is prepared and reason too he should
 this apish and unmannerly approach
 this harness'd masque and unadvised revel
 this unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops
 the king doth smile at and is well prepared
 to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
 from out the circle of his territories
 that hand which had the strength even at your door
 to cudgel you and make you take the hatch
 to dive like buckets in concealed wells
 to crouch in litter of your stable planks
 to lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks
 to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
 in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
 even at the crying of your nation's crow
 thinking his voice an armed englishman
 shall that victorious hand be feebled here
 that in your chambers gave you chastisement
 no know the gallant monarch is in arms
 and like an eagle o'er his aery towers
 to souse annoyance that comes near his nest
 and you degenerate you ingrate revolts
 you bloody neroes ripping up the womb
 of your dear mother england blush for shame
 for your own ladies and palevisaged maids
 like amazons come tripping after drums
 their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
 their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
 to fierce and bloody inclination
lewis there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
 we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well
 we hold our time too precious to be spent
 with such a brabbler
cardinal pandulph give me leave to speak
bastard no i will speak
lewis we will attend to neither
 strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
 plead for our interest and our being here
bastard indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
 and so shall you being beaten do but start
 an echo with the clamour of thy drum
 and even at hand a drum is ready braced
 that shall reverberate all as loud as thine
 sound but another and another shall
 as loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
 and mock the deepmouth'd thunder for at hand
 not trusting to this halting legate here
 whom he hath used rather for sport than need
 is warlike john and in his forehead sits
 a bareribb'd death whose office is this day
 to feast upon whole thousands of the french
lewis strike up our drums to find this danger out
bastard and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt

salisbury i did not think the king so stored with friends
pembroke up once again put spirit in the french

pembroke it is the count melun
salisbury wounded to death
melun fly noble english you are bought and sold
 unthread the rude eye of rebellion
 and welcome home again discarded faith
 seek out king john and fall before his feet
 for if the french be lords of this loud day
 he means to recompense the pains you take
 by cutting off your heads thus hath he sworn
 and i with him and many moe with me
 upon the altar at saint edmundsbury
 even on that altar where we swore to you
 dear amity and everlasting love
salisbury may this be possible may this be true
melun have i not hideous death within my view
 retaining but a quantity of life
 which bleeds away even as a form of wax
 resolveth from his figure gainst the fire
 what in the world should make me now deceive
 since i must lose the use of all deceit
 why should i then be false since it is true
 that i must die here and live hence by truth
 i say again if lewis do win the day
 he is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
 behold another day break in the east
 but even this night whose black contagious breath
 already smokes about the burning crest
 of the old feeble and daywearied sun
 even this ill night your breathing shall expire
 paying the fine of rated treachery
 even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
 if lewis by your assistance win the day
 commend me to one hubert with your king
 the love of him and this respect besides
 for that my grandsire was an englishman
 awakes my conscience to confess all this
 in lieu whereof i pray you bear me hence
 from forth the noise and rumour of the field
 where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
 in peace and part this body and my soul
 with contemplation and devout desires
salisbury we do believe thee and beshrew my soul
 but i do love the favour and the form
 of this most fair occasion by the which
 we will untread the steps of damned flight
 and like a bated and retired flood
 leaving our rankness and irregular course
 stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
 and cabby run on in obedience
 even to our ocean to our great king john
 my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
 for i do see the cruel pangs of death
 right in thine eye away my friends new flight

 and wound our tattering colours clearly up
 last in the field and almost lords of it

 as this hath made me who was he that said

 to acquaint you with this evil that you might

 than if you had at leisure known of this
bastard how did he take it who did taste to him
hubert a monk i tell you a resolved villain
 whose bowels suddenly burst out the king

bastard who didst thou leave to tend his majesty
hubert why know you not the lords are all come back

 and they are all about his majesty
bastard withhold thine indignation mighty heaven

scene vii the orchard in swinstead abbey
 enter prince henry salisbury and bigot
prince henry it is too late the life of all his blood
 is touch'd corruptibly and his pure brain
 which some suppose the soul's frail dwellinghouse
 doth by the idle comments that it makes
 foretell the ending of mortality
 enter pembroke
pembroke his highness yet doth speak and holds belief
 that being brought into the open air
 it would allay the burning quality
 of that fell poison which assaileth him
prince henry let him be brought into the orchard here
 doth he still rage
 exit bigot
pembroke he is more patient
 than when you left him even now he sung
prince henry o vanity of sickness fierce extremes
 in their continuance will not feel themselves
 death having prey'd upon the outward parts
 leaves them invisible and his siege is now
 against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
 with many legions of strange fantasies
 which in their throng and press to that last hold
 confound themselves tis strange that death
 should sing
 i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
 who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
 and from the organpipe of frailty sings
 his soul and body to their lasting rest
salisbury be of good comfort prince for you are born
 to set a form upon that indigest
 which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
 enter attendants and bigot carrying king john in a chair
king john ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom
 it would not out at windows nor at doors
 there is so hot a summer in my bosom
 that all my bowels crumble up to dust
 i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
 upon a parchment and against this fire
 do i shrink up
prince henry how fares your majesty
king john poison'dill faredead forsook cast off
 and none of you will bid the winter come
 to thrust his icy fingers in my maw
 nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
 through my burn'd bosom nor entreat the north
 to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
 and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much
 i beg cold comfort and you are so strait
 and so ingrateful you deny me that
prince henry o that there were some virtue in my tears
 that might relieve you
king john the salt in them is hot
 within me is a hell and there the poison
 is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
 on unreprievable condemned blood
 enter the bastard
bastard o i am scalded with my violent motion
 and spleen of speed to see your majesty
king john o cousin thou art come to set mine eye
 the tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd
 and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
 are turned to one thread one little hair
 my heart hath one poor string to stay it by
 which holds but till thy news be uttered
 and then all this thou seest is but a clod
 and module of confounded royalty
bastard the dauphin is preparing hitherward
 where heaven he knows how we shall answer him
 for in a night the best part of my power
 as i upon advantage did remove
 were in the washes all unwarily
 devoured by the unexpected flood
 king john dies
salisbury you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
 my liege my lord but now a king now thus
prince henry even so must i run on and even so stop
 what surety of the world what hope what stay
 when this was now a king and now is clay
bastard art thou gone so i do but stay behind
 to do the office for thee of revenge
 and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
 as it on earth hath been thy servant still
 now now you stars that move in your right spheres
 where be your powers show now your mended faiths
 and instantly return with me again
 to push destruction and perpetual shame
 out of the weak door of our fainting land
 straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
 the dauphin rages at our very heels
salisbury it seems you know not then so much as we
 the cardinal pandulph is within at rest
 who half an hour since came from the dauphin
 and brings from him such offers of our peace
 as we with honour and respect may take
 with purpose presently to leave this war
bastard he will the rather do it when he sees
 ourselves well sinewed to our defence
salisbury nay it is in a manner done already
 for many carriages he hath dispatch'd
 to the seaside and put his cause and quarrel
 to the disposing of the cardinal
 with whom yourself myself and other lords
 if you think meet this afternoon will post
 to consummate this business happily
bastard let it be so and you my noble prince
 with other princes that may best be spared
 shall wait upon your father's funeral
prince henry at worcester must his body be interr'd
 for so he will'd it
bastard thither shall it then
 and happily may your sweet self put on
 the lineal state and glory of the land
 to whom with all submission on my knee
 i do bequeath my faithful services
 and true subjection everlastingly
salisbury and the like tender of our love we make
 to rest without a spot for evermore
prince henry i have a kind soul that would give you thanks
 and knows not how to do it but with tears
bastard o let us pay the time but needful woe
 since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
 this england never did nor never shall
 lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
 but when it first did help to wound itself
 now these her princes are come home again
 come the three corners of the world in arms
 and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue
 if england to itself do rest but true

king richard ii old john of gaunt timehonour'd lancaster
 hast thou according to thy oath and band
 brought hither henry hereford thy bold son
 here to make good the boisterous late appeal
 which then our leisure would not let us hear
 against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
john of gaunt i have my liege
king richard ii tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
 if he appeal the duke on ancient malice
 or worthily as a good subject should
 on some known ground of treachery in him
john of gaunt as near as i could sift him on that argument
 on some apparent danger seen in him
 aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice
king richard ii then call them to our presence face to face
 and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
 the accuser and the accused freely speak
 highstomach'd are they both and full of ire
 in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
 enter henry bolingbroke and thomas mowbray
henry bolingbroke many years of happy days befal
 my gracious sovereign my most loving liege
thomas mowbray each day still better other's happiness
 until the heavens envying earth's good hap
 add an immortal title to your crown
king richard ii we thank you both yet one but flatters us
 as well appeareth by the cause you come
 namely to appeal each other of high treason
 cousin of hereford what dost thou object
 against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
henry bolingbroke first heaven be the record to my speech
 in the devotion of a subject's love
 tendering the precious safety of my prince
 and free from other misbegotten hate
 come i appellant to this princely presence
 now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee
 and mark my greeting well for what i speak
 my body shall make good upon this earth
 or my divine soul answer it in heaven
 thou art a traitor and a miscreant
 too good to be so and too bad to live
 since the more fair and crystal is the sky
 the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
 once more the more to aggravate the note
 with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat
 and wish so please my sovereign ere i move
 what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
thomas mowbray let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
 tis not the trial of a woman's war
 the bitter clamour of two eager tongues
 can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
 the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this
 yet can i not of such tame patience boast
 as to be hush'd and nought at all to say
 first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
 from giving reins and spurs to my free speech
 which else would post until it had return'd
 these terms of treason doubled down his throat
 setting aside his high blood's royalty
 and let him be no kinsman to my liege
 i do defy him and i spit at him
 call him a slanderous coward and a villain
 which to maintain i would allow him odds
 and meet him were i tied to run afoot
 even to the frozen ridges of the alps
 or any other ground inhabitable
 where ever englishman durst set his foot
 mean time let this defend my loyalty
 by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
henry bolingbroke pale trembling coward there i throw my gage
 disclaiming here the kindred of the king
 and lay aside my high blood's royalty
 which fear not reverence makes thee to except
 if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
 as to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop
 by that and all the rites of knighthood else
 will i make good against thee arm to arm
 what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise
thomas mowbray i take it up and by that sword i swear
 which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
 i'll answer thee in any fair degree
 or chivalrous design of knightly trial
 and when i mount alive may i not light
 if i be traitor or unjustly fight
king richard ii what doth our cousin lay to mowbray's charge
 it must be great that can inherit us
 so much as of a thought of ill in him
henry bolingbroke look what i speak my life shall prove it true
 that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
 in name of lendings for your highness soldiers
 the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments
 like a false traitor and injurious villain
 besides i say and will in battle prove
 or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
 that ever was survey'd by english eye
 that all the treasons for these eighteen years
 complotted and contrived in this land
 fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring
 further i say and further will maintain
 upon his bad life to make all this good
 that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death
 suggest his soonbelieving adversaries
 and consequently like a traitor coward
 sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood
 which blood like sacrificing abel's cries
 even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
 to me for justice and rough chastisement
 and by the glorious worth of my descent
 this arm shall do it or this life be spent
king richard ii how high a pitch his resolution soars
 thomas of norfolk what say'st thou to this
thomas mowbray o let my sovereign turn away his face
 and bid his ears a little while be deaf
 till i have told this slander of his blood
 how god and good men hate so foul a liar
king richard ii mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
 were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir
 as he is but my father's brother's son
 now by my sceptre's awe i make a vow
 such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
 should nothing privilege him nor partialize
 the unstooping firmness of my upright soul
 he is our subject mowbray so art thou
 free speech and fearless i to thee allow
thomas mowbray then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
 through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
 three parts of that receipt i had for calais
 disbursed i duly to his highness soldiers
 the other part reserved i by consent
 for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
 upon remainder of a dear account
 since last i went to france to fetch his queen
 now swallow down that lie for gloucester's death
 i slew him not but to my own disgrace
 neglected my sworn duty in that case
 for you my noble lord of lancaster
 the honourable father to my foe
 once did i lay an ambush for your life
 a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
 but ere i last received the sacrament
 i did confess it and exactly begg'd
 your grace's pardon and i hope i had it
 this is my fault as for the rest appeall'd
 it issues from the rancour of a villain
 a recreant and most degenerate traitor
 which in myself i boldly will defend
 and interchangeably hurl down my gage
 upon this overweening traitor's foot
 to prove myself a loyal gentleman
 even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom
 in haste whereof most heartily i pray
 your highness to assign our trial day
king richard ii wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me
 let's purge this choler without letting blood
 this we prescribe though no physician
 deep malice makes too deep incision
 forget forgive conclude and be agreed
 our doctors say this is no month to bleed
 good uncle let this end where it begun
 we'll calm the duke of norfolk you your son
john of gaunt to be a makepeace shall become my age
 throw down my son the duke of norfolk's gage
king richard ii and norfolk throw down his
john of gaunt when harry when
 obedience bids i should not bid again
king richard ii norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot
thomas mowbray myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot
 my life thou shalt command but not my shame
 the one my duty owes but my fair name
 despite of death that lives upon my grave
 to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have
 i am disgraced impeach'd and baffled here
 pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear
 the which no balm can cure but his heartblood
 which breathed this poison
king richard ii rage must be withstood
 give me his gage lions make leopards tame
thomas mowbray yea but not change his spots take but my shame
 and i resign my gage my dear dear lord
 the purest treasure mortal times afford
 is spotless reputation that away
 men are but gilded loam or painted clay
 a jewel in a tentimesbarr'dup chest
 is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
 mine honour is my life both grow in one
 take honour from me and my life is done
 then dear my liege mine honour let me try
 in that i live and for that will i die
king richard ii cousin throw up your gage do you begin
henry bolingbroke o god defend my soul from such deep sin
 shall i seem crestfall'n in my father's sight
 or with pale beggarfear impeach my height
 before this outdared dastard ere my tongue
 shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
 or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
 the slavish motive of recanting fear
 and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
 where shame doth harbour even in mowbray's face
 exit john of gaunt
king richard ii we were not born to sue but to command
 which since we cannot do to make you friends
 be ready as your lives shall answer it
 at coventry upon saint lambert's day
 there shall your swords and lances arbitrate
 the swelling difference of your settled hate
 since we can not atone you we shall see
 justice design the victor's chivalry
 lord marshal command our officers at arms
 be ready to direct these home alarms

act i
scene ii the duke of lancaster's palace
 enter john of gaunt with duchess
john of gaunt alas the part i had in woodstock's blood
 doth more solicit me than your exclaims
 to stir against the butchers of his life
 but since correction lieth in those hands
 which made the fault that we cannot correct
 put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
 who when they see the hours ripe on earth
 will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads
duchess finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
 hath love in thy old blood no living fire
 edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one
 were as seven vials of his sacred blood
 or seven fair branches springing from one root
 some of those seven are dried by nature's course
 some of those branches by the destinies cut
 but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester
 one vial full of edward's sacred blood
 one flourishing branch of his most royal root
 is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt
 is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded
 by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe
 ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
 that metal that selfmould that fashion'd thee
 made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
 yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent
 in some large measure to thy father's death
 in that thou seest thy wretched brother die
 who was the model of thy father's life
 call it not patience gaunt it is despair
 in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd
 thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
 teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
 that which in mean men we intitle patience
 is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
 what shall i say to safeguard thine own life
 the best way is to venge my gloucester's death
john of gaunt god's is the quarrel for god's substitute
 his deputy anointed in his sight
 hath caused his death the which if wrongfully
 let heaven revenge for i may never lift
 an angry arm against his minister
duchess where then alas may i complain myself
john of gaunt to god the widow's champion and defence
duchess why then i will farewell old gaunt
 thou goest to coventry there to behold
 our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight
 o sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear
 that it may enter butcher mowbray's breast
 or if misfortune miss the first career
 be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
 they may break his foaming courser's back
 and throw the rider headlong in the lists
 a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford
 farewell old gaunt thy sometimes brother's wife
 with her companion grief must end her life
john of gaunt sister farewell i must to coventry
 as much good stay with thee as go with me
duchess yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls
 not with the empty hollowness but weight
 i take my leave before i have begun
 for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
 commend me to thy brother edmund york
 lo this is allnay yet depart not so
 though this be all do not so quickly go
 i shall remember more bid himah what
 with all good speed at plashy visit me
 alack and what shall good old york there see
 but empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls
 unpeopled offices untrodden stones
 and what hear there for welcome but my groans
 therefore commend me let him not come there
 to seek out sorrow that dwells every where
 desolate desolate will i hence and die
 the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye

henry bolingbroke harry of hereford lancaster and derby

 to prove by god's grace and my body's valour
 in lists on thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
 that he is a traitor foul and dangerous
 to god of heaven king richard and to me
 and as i truly fight defend me heaven
lord marshal on pain of death no person be so bold
 or daringhardy as to touch the lists
 except the marshal and such officers
 appointed to direct these fair designs
henry bolingbroke lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign's hand
 and bow my knee before his majesty
 for mowbray and myself are like two men
 that vow a long and weary pilgrimage
 then let us take a ceremonious leave
 and loving farewell of our several friends
lord marshal the appellant in all duty greets your highness
 and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave
king richard ii we will descend and fold him in our arms
 cousin of hereford as thy cause is right
 so be thy fortune in this royal fight
 farewell my blood which if today thou shed
 lament we may but not revenge thee dead
henry bolingbroke o let no noble eye profane a tear
 for me if i be gored with mowbray's spear
 as confident as is the falcon's flight
 against a bird do i with mowbray fight
 my loving lord i take my leave of you
 of you my noble cousin lord aumerle
 not sick although i have to do with death
 but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
 lo as at english feasts so i regreet
 the daintiest last to make the end most sweet
 o thou the earthly author of my blood
 whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
 doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
 to reach at victory above my head
 add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
 and with thy blessings steel my lance's point
 that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat
 and furbish new the name of john a gaunt
 even in the lusty havior of his son
john of gaunt god in thy good cause make thee prosperous
 be swift like lightning in the execution
 and let thy blows doubly redoubled
 fall like amazing thunder on the casque
 of thy adverse pernicious enemy
 rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live
henry bolingbroke mine innocency and saint george to thrive
thomas mowbray however god or fortune cast my lot
 there lives or dies true to king richard's throne
 a loyal just and upright gentleman
 never did captive with a freer heart
 cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
 his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement
 more than my dancing soul doth celebrate
 this feast of battle with mine adversary
 most mighty liege and my companion peers
 take from my mouth the wish of happy years
 as gentle and as jocund as to jest
 go i to fight truth hath a quiet breast
king richard ii farewell my lord securely i espy
 virtue with valour couched in thine eye
 order the trial marshal and begin
lord marshal harry of hereford lancaster and derby
 receive thy lance and god defend the right
henry bolingbroke strong as a tower in hope i cry amen
lord marshal go bear this lance to thomas duke of norfolk
first herald harry of hereford lancaster and derby
 stands here for god his sovereign and himself
 on pain to be found false and recreant
 to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
 a traitor to his god his king and him
 and dares him to set forward to the fight
second herald here standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
 on pain to be found false and recreant
 both to defend himself and to approve
 henry of hereford lancaster and derby
 to god his sovereign and to him disloyal
 courageously and with a free desire
 attending but the signal to begin
lord marshal sound trumpets and set forward combatants
 a charge sounded
 stay the king hath thrown his warder down
king richard ii let them lay by their helmets and their spears
 and both return back to their chairs again
 withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
 while we return these dukes what we decree
 a long flourish
 draw near
 and list what with our council we have done
 for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
 with that dear blood which it hath fostered
 and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
 of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours sword
 and for we think the eaglewinged pride
 of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts
 with rivalhating envy set on you
 to wake our peace which in our country's cradle
 draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
 which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums
 with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray
 and grating shock of wrathful iron arms
 might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
 and make us wade even in our kindred's blood
 therefore we banish you our territories
 you cousin hereford upon pain of life
 till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
 shall not regreet our fair dominions
 but tread the stranger paths of banishment
henry bolingbroke your will be done this must my comfort be
 sun that warms you here shall shine on me
 and those his golden beams to you here lent
 shall point on me and gild my banishment
king richard ii norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
 which i with some unwillingness pronounce
 the sly slow hours shall not determinate
 the dateless limit of thy dear exile
 the hopeless word of never to return'
 breathe i against thee upon pain of life
thomas mowbray a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
 and all unlook'd for from your highness mouth
 a dearer merit not so deep a maim
 as to be cast forth in the common air
 have i deserved at your highness hands
 the language i have learn'd these forty years
 my native english now i must forego
 and now my tongue's use is to me no more
 than an unstringed viol or a harp
 or like a cunning instrument cased up
 or being open put into his hands
 that knows no touch to tune the harmony
 within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue
 doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips
 and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
 is made my gaoler to attend on me
 i am too old to fawn upon a nurse
 too far in years to be a pupil now
 what is thy sentence then but speechless death
 which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
king richard ii it boots thee not to be compassionate
 after our sentence plaining comes too late
thomas mowbray then thus i turn me from my country's light
 to dwell in solemn shades of endless night
king richard ii return again and take an oath with thee
 lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands
 swear by the duty that you owe to god
 our part therein we banish with yourselves
 to keep the oath that we administer
 you never shall so help you truth and god
 embrace each other's love in banishment
 nor never look upon each other's face
 nor never write regreet nor reconcile
 this louring tempest of your homebred hate
 nor never by advised purpose meet
 to plot contrive or complot any ill
 gainst us our state our subjects or our land
henry bolingbroke i swear
thomas mowbray and i to keep all this
henry bolingbroke norfolk so far as to mine enemy
 by this time had the king permitted us
 one of our souls had wander'd in the air
 banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
 as now our flesh is banish'd from this land
 confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
 since thou hast far to go bear not along
 the clogging burthen of a guilty soul
thomas mowbray no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor
 my name be blotted from the book of life
 and i from heaven banish'd as from hence
 but what thou art god thou and i do know
 and all too soon i fear the king shall rue
 farewell my liege now no way can i stray
 save back to england all the world's my way
 exit
king richard ii uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
 i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect
 hath from the number of his banish'd years
 pluck'd four away
 to henry bolingbroke
 six frozen winter spent
 return with welcome home from banishment
henry bolingbroke how long a time lies in one little word
 four lagging winters and four wanton springs
 end in a word such is the breath of kings
john of gaunt i thank my liege that in regard of me
 he shortens four years of my son's exile
 but little vantage shall i reap thereby
 for ere the six years that he hath to spend
 can change their moons and bring their times about
 my oildried lamp and timebewasted light
 shall be extinct with age and endless night
 my inch of taper will be burnt and done
 and blindfold death not let me see my son
king richard ii why uncle thou hast many years to live
john of gaunt but not a minute king that thou canst give
 shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
 and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
 thou canst help time to furrow me with age
 but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
 thy word is current with him for my death
 but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
king richard ii thy son is banish'd upon good advice
 whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave
 why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour
john of gaunt things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
 you urged me as a judge but i had rather
 you would have bid me argue like a father
 o had it been a stranger not my child
 to smooth his fault i should have been more mild
 a partial slander sought i to avoid
 and in the sentence my own life destroy'd
 alas i look'd when some of you should say
 i was too strict to make mine own away
 but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
 against my will to do myself this wrong
king richard ii cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
 six years we banish him and he shall go
 flourish exeunt king richard ii and train
duke of aumerle cousin farewell what presence must not know
 from where you do remain let paper show
lord marshal my lord no leave take i for i will ride
 as far as land will let me by your side
john of gaunt o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
 that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends
henry bolingbroke i have too few to take my leave of you
 when the tongue's office should be prodigal
 to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
john of gaunt thy grief is but thy absence for a time
henry bolingbroke joy absent grief is present for that time
john of gaunt what is six winters they are quickly gone
henry bolingbroke to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
john of gaunt call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure
henry bolingbroke my heart will sigh when i miscall it so
 which finds it an inforced pilgrimage
john of gaunt the sullen passage of thy weary steps
 esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
 the precious jewel of thy home return
henry bolingbroke nay rather every tedious stride i make
 will but remember me what a deal of world
 i wander from the jewels that i love
 must i not serve a long apprenticehood
 to foreign passages and in the end
 having my freedom boast of nothing else
 but that i was a journeyman to grief
john of gaunt all places that the eye of heaven visits
 are to a wise man ports and happy havens
 teach thy necessity to reason thus
 there is no virtue like necessity
 think not the king did banish thee
 but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit
 where it perceives it is but faintly borne
 go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour
 and not the king exiled thee or suppose
 devouring pestilence hangs in our air
 and thou art flying to a fresher clime
 look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
 to lie that way thou go'st not whence thou comest
 suppose the singing birds musicians
 the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd
 the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
 than a delightful measure or a dance
 for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
 the man that mocks at it and sets it light
henry bolingbroke o who can hold a fire in his hand
 by thinking on the frosty caucasus
 or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
 by bare imagination of a feast
 or wallow naked in december snow
 by thinking on fantastic summer's heat
 o no the apprehension of the good
 gives but the greater feeling to the worse
 fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
 than when he bites but lanceth not the sore
john of gaunt come come my son i'll bring thee on thy way
 had i thy youth and cause i would not stay
henry bolingbroke then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu
 my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
 where'er i wander boast of this i can
 though banish'd yet a trueborn englishman

act i
scene iv the court
 enter king richard ii with bagot and green at one
 door and the duke of aumerle at another
king richard ii we did observe cousin aumerle
 how far brought you high hereford on his way
duke of aumerle i brought high hereford if you call him so
 but to the next highway and there i left him
king richard ii and say what store of parting tears were shed
duke of aumerle faith none for me except the northeast wind
 which then blew bitterly against our faces
 awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
 did grace our hollow parting with a tear
king richard ii what said our cousin when you parted with him
duke of aumerle farewell'
 and for my heart disdained that my tongue
 should so profane the word that taught me craft
 to counterfeit oppression of such grief
 that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave
 marry would the word farewell have lengthen'd hours
 and added years to his short banishment
 he should have had a volume of farewells
 but since it would not he had none of me
king richard ii he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
 when time shall call him home from banishment
 whether our kinsman come to see his friends
 ourself and bushy bagot here and green
 observed his courtship to the common people
 how he did seem to dive into their hearts
 with humble and familiar courtesy
 what reverence he did throw away on slaves
 wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
 and patient underbearing of his fortune
 as twere to banish their affects with him
 off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench
 a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
 and had the tribute of his supple knee
 with thanks my countrymen my loving friends'
 as were our england in reversion his
 and he our subjects next degree in hope
green well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
 now for the rebels which stand out in ireland
 expedient manage must be made my liege
 ere further leisure yield them further means
 for their advantage and your highness loss
king richard ii we will ourself in person to this war
 and for our coffers with too great a court
 and liberal largess are grown somewhat light
 we are inforced to farm our royal realm
 the revenue whereof shall furnish us
 for our affairs in hand if that come short
 our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
 whereto when they shall know what men are rich
 they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
 and send them after to supply our wants
 for we will make for ireland presently
 enter bushy
 bushy what news
bushy old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord
 suddenly taken and hath sent post haste
 to entreat your majesty to visit him
king richard ii where lies he
bushy at ely house
king richard ii now put it god in the physician's mind
 to help him to his grave immediately
 the lining of his coffers shall make coats
 to deck our soldiers for these irish wars
 come gentlemen let's all go visit him
 pray god we may make haste and come too late
all amen

act ii
scene i ely house
 enter john of gaunt sick with the duke of york
 &c
john of gaunt will the king come that i may breathe my last
 in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
duke of york vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
 for all in vain comes counsel to his ear
john of gaunt o but they say the tongues of dying men
 enforce attention like deep harmony
 where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
 for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
 he that no more must say is listen'd more
 than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
 more are men's ends mark'd than their lives before
 the setting sun and music at the close
 as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
 writ in remembrance more than things long past
 though richard my life's counsel would not hear
 my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear
duke of york no it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds
 as praises of whose taste the wise are fond
 lascivious metres to whose venom sound
 the open ear of youth doth always listen
 report of fashions in proud italy
 whose manners still our tardy apish nation
 limps after in base imitation
 where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
 so it be new there's no respect how vile
 that is not quickly buzzed into his ears
 then all too late comes counsel to be heard
 where will doth mutiny with wit's regard
 direct not him whose way himself will choose
 tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose
john of gaunt methinks i am a prophet new inspired
 and thus expiring do foretell of him
 his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
 for violent fires soon burn out themselves
 small showers last long but sudden storms are short
 he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
 with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
 light vanity insatiate cormorant
 consuming means soon preys upon itself
 this royal throne of kings this scepter'd isle
 this earth of majesty this seat of mars
 this other eden demiparadise
 this fortress built by nature for herself
 against infection and the hand of war
 this happy breed of men this little world
 this precious stone set in the silver sea
 which serves it in the office of a wall
 or as a moat defensive to a house
 against the envy of less happier lands
 this blessed plot this earth this realm this england
 this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
 fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth
 renowned for their deeds as far from home
 for christian service and true chivalry
 as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry
 of the world's ransom blessed mary's son
 this land of such dear souls this dear dear land
 dear for her reputation through the world
 is now leased out i die pronouncing it
 like to a tenement or pelting farm
 england bound in with the triumphant sea
 whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
 of watery neptune is now bound in with shame
 with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
 that england that was wont to conquer others
 hath made a shameful conquest of itself
 ah would the scandal vanish with my life
 how happy then were my ensuing death
 enter king richard ii and queen duke of aumerle
 bushy green bagot lord ross and lord
 willoughby
duke of york the king is come deal mildly with his youth
 for young hot colts being raged do rage the more
queen how fares our noble uncle lancaster
king richard ii what comfort man how is't with aged gaunt
john of gaunt o how that name befits my composition
 old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
 within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
 and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
 for sleeping england long time have i watch'd
 watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt
 the pleasure that some fathers feed upon
 is my strict fast i mean my children's looks
 and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
 gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave
 whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
king richard ii can sick men play so nicely with their names
john of gaunt no misery makes sport to mock itself
 since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
 i mock my name great king to flatter thee
king richard ii should dying men flatter with those that live
john of gaunt no no men living flatter those that die
king richard ii thou now adying say'st thou flatterest me
john of gaunt o no thou diest though i the sicker be
king richard ii i am in health i breathe and see thee ill
john of gaunt now he that made me knows i see thee ill
 ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
 thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land
 wherein thou liest in reputation sick
 and thou too careless patient as thou art
 commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
 of those physicians that first wounded thee
 a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
 whose compass is no bigger than thy head
 and yet incaged in so small a verge
 the waste is no whit lesser than thy land
 o had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
 seen how his son's son should destroy his sons
 from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
 deposing thee before thou wert possess'd
 which art possess'd now to depose thyself
 why cousin wert thou regent of the world
 it were a shame to let this land by lease
 but for thy world enjoying but this land
 is it not more than shame to shame it so
 landlord of england art thou now not king
 thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou
king richard ii a lunatic leanwitted fool
 presuming on an ague's privilege
 darest with thy frozen admonition
 make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
 with fury from his native residence
 now by my seat's right royal majesty
 wert thou not brother to great edward's son
 this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
 should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
john of gaunt o spare me not my brother edward's son
 for that i was his father edward's son
 that blood already like the pelican
 hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused
 my brother gloucester plain wellmeaning soul
 whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls
 may be a precedent and witness good
 that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood
 join with the present sickness that i have
 and thy unkindness be like crooked age
 to crop at once a too long wither'd flower
 live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
 these words hereafter thy tormentors be
 convey me to my bed then to my grave
 love they to live that love and honour have
 exit borne off by his attendants
king richard ii and let them die that age and sullens have
 for both hast thou and both become the grave
duke of york i do beseech your majesty impute his words
 to wayward sickliness and age in him
 he loves you on my life and holds you dear
 as harry duke of hereford were he here
king richard ii right you say true as hereford's love so his
 as theirs so mine and all be as it is
 enter northumberland
northumberland my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty
king richard ii what says he
northumberland nay nothing all is said
 his tongue is now a stringless instrument
 words life and all old lancaster hath spent
duke of york be york the next that must be bankrupt so
 though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
king richard ii the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
 his time is spent our pilgrimage must be
 so much for that now for our irish wars
 we must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns
 which live like venom where no venom else
 but only they have privilege to live
 and for these great affairs do ask some charge
 towards our assistance we do seize to us
 the plate corn revenues and moveables
 whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd
duke of york how long shall i be patient ah how long
 shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
 not gloucester's death nor hereford's banishment
 not gaunt's rebukes nor england's private wrongs
 nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke
 about his marriage nor my own disgrace
 have ever made me sour my patient cheek
 or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face
 i am the last of noble edward's sons
 of whom thy father prince of wales was first
 in war was never lion raged more fierce
 in peace was never gentle lamb more mild
 than was that young and princely gentleman
 his face thou hast for even so look'd he
 accomplish'd with the number of thy hours
 but when he frown'd it was against the french
 and not against his friends his noble hand
 did will what he did spend and spent not that
 which his triumphant father's hand had won
 his hands were guilty of no kindred blood
 but bloody with the enemies of his kin
 o richard york is too far gone with grief
 or else he never would compare between
king richard ii why uncle what's the matter
duke of york o my liege
 pardon me if you please if not i pleased
 not to be pardon'd am content withal
 seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
 the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford
 is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live
 was not gaunt just and is not harry true
 did not the one deserve to have an heir
 is not his heir a welldeserving son
 take hereford's rights away and take from time
 his charters and his customary rights
 let not tomorrow then ensue today
 be not thyself for how art thou a king
 but by fair sequence and succession
 now afore godgod forbid i say true
 if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights
 call in the letters patent that he hath
 by his attorneysgeneral to sue
 his livery and deny his offer'd homage
 you pluck a thousand dangers on your head
 you lose a thousand welldisposed hearts
 and prick my tender patience to those thoughts
 which honour and allegiance cannot think
king richard ii think what you will we seize into our hands
 his plate his goods his money and his lands
duke of york i'll not be by the while my liege farewell
 what will ensue hereof there's none can tell
 but by bad courses may be understood
 that their events can never fall out good
 exit
king richard ii go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight
 bid him repair to us to ely house
 to see this business tomorrow next
 we will for ireland and tis time i trow
 and we create in absence of ourself
 our uncle york lord governor of england
 for he is just and always loved us well
 come on our queen tomorrow must we part
 be merry for our time of stay is short
 flourish exeunt king richard ii queen duke of
 aumerle bushy green and bagot
northumberland well lords the duke of lancaster is dead
lord ross and living too for now his son is duke
lord willoughby barely in title not in revenue
northumberland richly in both if justice had her right
lord ross my heart is great but it must break with silence
 ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue
northumberland nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more
 that speaks thy words again to do thee harm
lord willoughby tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford
 if it be so out with it boldly man
 quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
lord ross no good at all that i can do for him
 unless you call it good to pity him
 bereft and gelded of his patrimony
northumberland now afore god tis shame such wrongs are borne
 in him a royal prince and many moe
 of noble blood in this declining land
 the king is not himself but basely led
 by flatterers and what they will inform
 merely in hate gainst any of us all
 that will the king severely prosecute
 gainst us our lives our children and our heirs
lord ross the commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes
 and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined
 for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
lord willoughby and daily new exactions are devised
 as blanks benevolences and i wot not what
 but what o god's name doth become of this
northumberland wars have not wasted it for warr'd he hath not
 but basely yielded upon compromise
 that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows
 more hath he spent in peace than they in wars
lord ross the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm
lord willoughby the king's grown bankrupt like a broken man
northumberland reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
lord ross he hath not money for these irish wars
 his burthenous taxations notwithstanding
 but by the robbing of the banish'd duke
northumberland his noble kinsman most degenerate king
 but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
 yet see no shelter to avoid the storm
 we see the wind sit sore upon our sails
 and yet we strike not but securely perish
lord ross we see the very wreck that we must suffer
 and unavoided is the danger now
 for suffering so the causes of our wreck
northumberland not so even through the hollow eyes of death
 i spy life peering but i dare not say
 how near the tidings of our comfort is
lord willoughby nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
lord ross be confident to speak northumberland
 we three are but thyself and speaking so
 thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold
northumberland then thus i have from port le blanc a bay
 in brittany received intelligence
 that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham
 
 that late broke from the duke of exeter
 his brother archbishop late of canterbury
 sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston
 sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint
 all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagne
 with eight tall ships three thousand men of war
 are making hither with all due expedience
 and shortly mean to touch our northern shore
 perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
 the first departing of the king for ireland
 if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
 imp out our drooping country's broken wing
 redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown
 wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
 and make high majesty look like itself
 away with me in post to ravenspurgh
 but if you faint as fearing to do so
 stay and be secret and myself will go
lord ross to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear
lord willoughby hold out my horse and i will first be there

act ii
scene ii the palace
 enter queen bushy and bagot
bushy madam your majesty is too much sad
 you promised when you parted with the king
 to lay aside lifeharming heaviness
 and entertain a cheerful disposition
queen to please the king i did to please myself
 i cannot do it yet i know no cause
 why i should welcome such a guest as grief
 save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
 as my sweet richard yet again methinks
 some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb
 is coming towards me and my inward soul
 with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves
 more than with parting from my lord the king
bushy each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
 which shows like grief itself but is not so
 for sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears
 divides one thing entire to many objects
 like perspectives which rightly gazed upon
 show nothing but confusion eyed awry
 distinguish form so your sweet majesty
 looking awry upon your lord's departure
 find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
 which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows
 of what it is not then thricegracious queen
 more than your lord's departure weep not more's not seen
 or if it be tis with false sorrow's eye
 which for things true weeps things imaginary
queen it may be so but yet my inward soul
 persuades me it is otherwise howe'er it be
 i cannot but be sad so heavy sad
 as though on thinking on no thought i think
 makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
bushy tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
queen tis nothing less conceit is still derived
 from some forefather grief mine is not so
 for nothing had begot my something grief
 or something hath the nothing that i grieve
 tis in reversion that i do possess
 but what it is that is not yet known what
 i cannot name tis nameless woe i wot
 enter green
green god save your majesty and well met gentlemen
 i hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland
queen why hopest thou so tis better hope he is
 for his designs crave haste his haste good hope
 then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd
green that he our hope might have retired his power
 and driven into despair an enemy's hope
 who strongly hath set footing in this land
 the banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself
 and with uplifted arms is safe arrived
 at ravenspurgh
queen now god in heaven forbid
green ah madam tis too true and that is worse
 the lord northumberland his son young henry percy
 the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby
 with all their powerful friends are fled to him
bushy why have you not proclaim'd northumberland
 and all the rest revolted faction traitors
green we have whereupon the earl of worcester
 hath broke his staff resign'd his stewardship
 and all the household servants fled with him
 to bolingbroke
queen so green thou art the midwife to my woe
 and bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir
 now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
 and i a gasping newdeliver'd mother
 have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd
bushy despair not madam
queen who shall hinder me
 i will despair and be at enmity
 with cozening hope he is a flatterer
 a parasite a keeper back of death
 who gently would dissolve the bands of life
 which false hope lingers in extremity
 enter duke of york
green here comes the duke of york
queen with signs of war about his aged neck
 o full of careful business are his looks
 uncle for god's sake speak comfortable words
duke of york should i do so i should belie my thoughts
 comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth
 where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
 your husband he is gone to save far off
 whilst others come to make him lose at home
 here am i left to underprop his land
 who weak with age cannot support myself
 now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made
 now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him
 enter a servant
servant my lord your son was gone before i came
duke of york he was why so go all which way it will
 the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold
 and will i fear revolt on hereford's side
 sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester
 bid her send me presently a thousand pound
 hold take my ring
servant my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship
 today as i came by i called there
 but i shall grieve you to report the rest
duke of york what is't knave
servant an hour before i came the duchess died
duke of york god for his mercy what a tide of woes
 comes rushing on this woeful land at once
 i know not what to do i would to god
 so my untruth had not provoked him to it
 the king had cut off my head with my brother's
 what are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland
 how shall we do for money for these wars
 come sistercousin i would saypray pardon me
 go fellow get thee home provide some carts
 and bring away the armour that is there
 exit servant
 gentlemen will you go muster men
 if i know how or which way to order these affairs
 thus thrust disorderly into my hands
 never believe me both are my kinsmen
 the one is my sovereign whom both my oath
 and duty bids defend the other again
 is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong'd
 whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
 well somewhat we must do come cousin i'll
 dispose of you
 gentlemen go muster up your men
 and meet me presently at berkeley
 i should to plashy too
 but time will not permit all is uneven
 and every thing is left at six and seven
 exeunt duke of york and queen
bushy the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland
 but none returns for us to levy power
 proportionable to the enemy
 is all unpossible
green besides our nearness to the king in love
 is near the hate of those love not the king
bagot and that's the wavering commons for their love
 lies in their purses and whoso empties them
 by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
bushy wherein the king stands generally condemn'd
bagot if judgement lie in them then so do we
 because we ever have been near the king
green well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle
 the earl of wiltshire is already there
bushy thither will i with you for little office
 the hateful commons will perform for us
 except like curs to tear us all to pieces
 will you go along with us
bagot no i will to ireland to his majesty
 farewell if heart's presages be not vain
 we three here art that ne'er shall meet again
bushy that's as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke
green alas poor duke the task he undertakes
 is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry
 where one on his side fights thousands will fly
 farewell at once for once for all and ever
bushy well we may meet again
bagot i fear me never

scene iii wilds in gloucestershire
 enter henry bolingbroke and northumberland with forces
henry bolingbroke how far is it my lord to berkeley now
northumberland believe me noble lord
 i am a stranger here in gloucestershire
 these high wild hills and rough uneven ways
 draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
 and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
 making the hard way sweet and delectable
 but i bethink me what a weary way
 from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
 in ross and willoughby wanting your company
 which i protest hath very much beguiled
 the tediousness and process of my travel
 but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
 the present benefit which i possess
 and hope to joy is little less in joy
 than hope enjoy'd by this the weary lords
 shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
 by sight of what i have your noble company
henry bolingbroke of much less value is my company
 than your good words but who comes here
 enter henry percy
northumberland it is my son young harry percy
 sent from my brother worcester whencesoever
 harry how fares your uncle
henry percy i had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you
northumberland why is he not with the queen
henry percy no my good lord he hath forsook the court
 broken his staff of office and dispersed
 the household of the king
northumberland what was his reason
 he was not so resolved when last we spake together
henry percy because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
 but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh
 to offer service to the duke of hereford
 and sent me over by berkeley to discover
 what power the duke of york had levied there
 then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh
northumberland have you forgot the duke of hereford boy
henry percy no my good lord for that is not forgot
 which ne'er i did remember to my knowledge
 i never in my life did look on him
northumberland then learn to know him now this is the duke
henry percy my gracious lord i tender you my service
 such as it is being tender raw and young
 which elder days shall ripen and confirm
 to more approved service and desert
henry bolingbroke i thank thee gentle percy and be sure
 i count myself in nothing else so happy
 as in a soul remembering my good friends
 and as my fortune ripens with thy love
 it shall be still thy true love's recompense
 my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
northumberland how far is it to berkeley and what stir
 keeps good old york there with his men of war
henry percy there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
 mann'd with three hundred men as i have heard
 and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour
 none else of name and noble estimate
 enter lord ross and lord willoughby
northumberland here come the lords of ross and willoughby
 bloody with spurring fieryred with haste
henry bolingbroke welcome my lords i wot your love pursues
 a banish'd traitor all my treasury
 is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd
 shall be your love and labour's recompense
lord ross your presence makes us rich most noble lord
lord willoughby and far surmounts our labour to attain it
henry bolingbroke evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
 which till my infant fortune comes to years
 stands for my bounty but who comes here
 enter lord berkeley
northumberland it is my lord of berkeley as i guess
lord berkeley my lord of hereford my message is to you
henry bolingbroke my lord my answer isto lancaster
 and i am come to seek that name in england
 and i must find that title in your tongue
 before i make reply to aught you say
lord berkeley mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
 to raze one title of your honour out
 to you my lord i come what lord you will
 from the most gracious regent of this land
 the duke of york to know what pricks you on
 to take advantage of the absent time
 and fright our native peace with selfborn arms
 enter duke of york attended
henry bolingbroke i shall not need transport my words by you
 here comes his grace in person my noble uncle
 kneels
duke of york show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
 whose duty is deceiveable and false
henry bolingbroke my gracious uncle
duke of york tut tut
 grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
 i am no traitor's uncle and that word grace'
 in an ungracious mouth is but profane
 why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
 dared once to touch a dust of england's ground
 but then more why why have they dared to march
 so many miles upon her peaceful bosom
 frighting her palefaced villages with war
 and ostentation of despised arms
 comest thou because the anointed king is hence
 why foolish boy the king is left behind
 and in my loyal bosom lies his power
 were i but now the lord of such hot youth
 as when brave gaunt thy father and myself
 rescued the black prince that young mars of men
 from forth the ranks of many thousand french
 o then how quickly should this arm of mine
 now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
 and minister correction to thy fault
henry bolingbroke my gracious uncle let me know my fault
 on what condition stands it and wherein
duke of york even in condition of the worst degree
 in gross rebellion and detested treason
 thou art a banish'd man and here art come
 before the expiration of thy time
 in braving arms against thy sovereign
henry bolingbroke as i was banish'd i was banish'd hereford
 but as i come i come for lancaster
 and noble uncle i beseech your grace
 look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
 you are my father for methinks in you
 i see old gaunt alive o then my father
 will you permit that i shall stand condemn'd
 a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
 pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
 to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born
 if that my cousin king be king of england
 it must be granted i am duke of lancaster
 you have a son aumerle my noble cousin
 had you first died and he been thus trod down
 he should have found his uncle gaunt a father
 to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
 i am denied to sue my livery here
 and yet my letterspatents give me leave
 my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold
 and these and all are all amiss employ'd
 what would you have me do i am a subject
 and i challenge law attorneys are denied me
 and therefore personally i lay my claim
 to my inheritance of free descent
northumberland the noble duke hath been too much abused
lord ross it stands your grace upon to do him right
lord willoughby base men by his endowments are made great
duke of york my lords of england let me tell you this
 i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
 and laboured all i could to do him right
 but in this kind to come in braving arms
 be his own carver and cut out his way
 to find out right with wrong it may not be
 and you that do abet him in this kind
 cherish rebellion and are rebels all
northumberland the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
 but for his own and for the right of that
 we all have strongly sworn to give him aid
 and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath
duke of york well well i see the issue of these arms
 i cannot mend it i must needs confess
 because my power is weak and all ill left
 but if i could by him that gave me life
 i would attach you all and make you stoop
 unto the sovereign mercy of the king
 but since i cannot be it known to you
 i do remain as neuter so fare you well
 unless you please to enter in the castle
 and there repose you for this night
henry bolingbroke an offer uncle that we will accept
 but we must win your grace to go with us
 to bristol castle which they say is held
 by bushy bagot and their complices
 the caterpillars of the commonwealth
 which i have sworn to weed and pluck away
duke of york it may be i will go with you but yet i'll pause
 for i am loath to break our country's laws
 nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
 things past redress are now with me past care

scene iv a camp in wales
 enter earl of salisbury and a welsh captain
captain my lord of salisbury we have stay'd ten days
 and hardly kept our countrymen together
 and yet we hear no tidings from the king
 therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell
earl of salisbury stay yet another day thou trusty welshman
 the king reposeth all his confidence in thee
captain tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
 the baytrees in our country are all wither'd
 and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
 the palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth
 and leanlook'd prophets whisper fearful change
 rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
 the one in fear to lose what they enjoy
 the other to enjoy by rage and war
 these signs forerun the death or fall of kings
 farewell our countrymen are gone and fled
 as well assured richard their king is dead
 exit
earl of salisbury ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind
 i see thy glory like a shooting star
 fall to the base earth from the firmament
 thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
 witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
 thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
 and crossly to thy good all fortune goes

scene i bristol before the castle
 enter henry bolingbroke duke of york
 northumberland lord ross henry percy lord
 willoughby with bushy and green prisoners
henry bolingbroke bring forth these men
 bushy and green i will not vex your souls
 since presently your souls must part your bodies
 with too much urging your pernicious lives
 for twere no charity yet to wash your blood
 from off my hands here in the view of men
 i will unfold some causes of your deaths
 you have misled a prince a royal king
 a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
 by you unhappied and disfigured clean
 you have in manner with your sinful hours
 made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
 broke the possession of a royal bed
 and stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
 with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
 myself a prince by fortune of my birth
 near to the king in blood and near in love
 till you did make him misinterpret me
 have stoop'd my neck under your injuries
 and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds
 eating the bitter bread of banishment
 whilst you have fed upon my signories
 dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods
 from my own windows torn my household coat
 razed out my imprese leaving me no sign
 save men's opinions and my living blood
 to show the world i am a gentleman
 this and much more much more than twice all this
 condemns you to the death see them deliver'd over
 to execution and the hand of death
bushy more welcome is the stroke of death to me
 than bolingbroke to england lords farewell
green my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
 and plague injustice with the pains of hell
henry bolingbroke my lord northumberland see them dispatch'd
 exeunt northumberland and others with the
 prisoners
 uncle you say the queen is at your house
 for god's sake fairly let her be entreated
 tell her i send to her my kind commends
 take special care my greetings be deliver'd
duke of york a gentleman of mine i have dispatch'd
 with letters of your love to her at large
henry bolingbroke thank gentle uncle come lords away
 to fight with glendower and his complices
 awhile to work and after holiday

scene ii the coast of wales a castle in view
 drums flourish and colours enter king richard
 ii the bishop of carlisle duke of aumerle and soldiers
king richard ii barkloughly castle call they this at hand
duke of aumerle yea my lord how brooks your grace the air
 after your late tossing on the breaking seas
king richard ii needs must i like it well i weep for joy
 to stand upon my kingdom once again
 dear earth i do salute thee with my hand
 though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs
 as a longparted mother with her child
 plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
 so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth
 and do thee favours with my royal hands
 feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth
 nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
 but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
 and heavygaited toads lie in their way
 doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
 which with usurping steps do trample thee
 yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
 and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
 guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder
 whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
 throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies
 mock not my senseless conjuration lords
 this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
 prove armed soldiers ere her native king
 shall falter under foul rebellion's arms
bishop of carlisle fear not my lord that power that made you king
 hath power to keep you king in spite of all
 the means that heaven yields must be embraced
 and not neglected else if heaven would
 and we will not heaven's offer we refuse
 the proffer'd means of succor and redress
duke of aumerle he means my lord that we are too remiss
 whilst bolingbroke through our security
 grows strong and great in substance and in power
king richard ii discomfortable cousin know'st thou not
 that when the searching eye of heaven is hid
 behind the globe that lights the lower world
 then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
 in murders and in outrage boldly here
 but when from under this terrestrial ball
 he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
 and darts his light through every guilty hole
 then murders treasons and detested sins
 the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs
 stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
 so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke
 who all this while hath revell'd in the night
 whilst we were wandering with the antipodes
 shall see us rising in our throne the east
 his treasons will sit blushing in his face
 not able to endure the sight of day
 but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin
 not all the water in the rough rude sea
 can wash the balm off from an anointed king
 the breath of worldly men cannot depose
 the deputy elected by the lord
 for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd
 to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
 god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
 a glorious angel then if angels fight
 weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
 enter earl of salisbury
 welcome my lord how far off lies your power
earl of salisbury nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
 than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue
 and bids me speak of nothing but despair
 one day too late i fear me noble lord
 hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
 o call back yesterday bid time return
 and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
 today today unhappy day too late
 o'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state
 for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead
 are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled
duke of aumerle comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale
king richard ii but now the blood of twenty thousand men
 did triumph in my face and they are fled
 and till so much blood thither come again
 have i not reason to look pale and dead
 all souls that will be safe fly from my side
 for time hath set a blot upon my pride
duke of aumerle comfort my liege remember who you are
king richard ii i had forgot myself am i not king
 awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
 is not the king's name twenty thousand names
 arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
 at thy great glory look not to the ground
 ye favourites of a king are we not high
 high be our thoughts i know my uncle york
 hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here
 enter sir stephen scroop
sir stephen scroop more health and happiness betide my liege
 than can my caretuned tongue deliver him
king richard ii mine ear is open and my heart prepared
 the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
 say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
 and what loss is it to be rid of care
 strives bolingbroke to be as great as we
 greater he shall not be if he serve god
 we'll serve him too and be his fellow so
 revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
 they break their faith to god as well as us
 cry woe destruction ruin and decay
 the worst is death and death will have his day
sir stephen scroop glad am i that your highness is so arm'd
 to bear the tidings of calamity
 like an unseasonable stormy day
 which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
 as if the world were all dissolved to tears
 so high above his limits swells the rage
 of bolingbroke covering your fearful land
 with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
 whitebeards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
 against thy majesty boys with women's voices
 strive to speak big and clap their female joints
 in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
 the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
 of doublefatal yew against thy state
 yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills
 against thy seat both young and old rebel
 and all goes worse than i have power to tell
king richard ii too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill
 where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot
 what is become of bushy where is green
 that they have let the dangerous enemy
 measure our confines with such peaceful steps
 if we prevail their heads shall pay for it
 i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke
sir stephen scroop peace have they made with him indeed my lord
king richard ii o villains vipers damn'd without redemption
 dogs easily won to fawn on any man
 snakes in my heartblood warm'd that sting my heart
 three judases each one thrice worse than judas
 would they make peace terrible hell make war
 upon their spotted souls for this offence
sir stephen scroop sweet love i see changing his property
 turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
 again uncurse their souls their peace is made
 with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
 have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
 and lie full low graved in the hollow ground
duke of aumerle is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead
sir stephen scroop ay all of them at bristol lost their heads
duke of aumerle where is the duke my father with his power
king richard ii no matter where of comfort no man speak
 let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
 make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
 write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
 let's choose executors and talk of wills
 and yet not so for what can we bequeath
 save our deposed bodies to the ground
 our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's
 and nothing can we call our own but death
 and that small model of the barren earth
 which serves as paste and cover to our bones
 for god's sake let us sit upon the ground
 and tell sad stories of the death of kings
 how some have been deposed some slain in war
 some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed
 some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd
 all murder'd for within the hollow crown
 that rounds the mortal temples of a king
 keeps death his court and there the antic sits
 scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
 allowing him a breath a little scene
 to monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks
 infusing him with self and vain conceit
 as if this flesh which walls about our life
 were brass impregnable and humour'd thus
 comes at the last and with a little pin
 bores through his castle wall and farewell king
 cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
 with solemn reverence throw away respect
 tradition form and ceremonious duty
 for you have but mistook me all this while
 i live with bread like you feel want
 taste grief need friends subjected thus
 how can you say to me i am a king
bishop of carlisle my lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes
 but presently prevent the ways to wail
 to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
 gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
 and so your follies fight against yourself
 fear and be slain no worse can come to fight
 and fight and die is death destroying death
 where fearing dying pays death servile breath
duke of aumerle my father hath a power inquire of him
 and learn to make a body of a limb
king richard ii thou chidest me well proud bolingbroke i come
 to change blows with thee for our day of doom
 this ague fit of fear is overblown
 an easy task it is to win our own
 say scroop where lies our uncle with his power
 speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
sir stephen scroop men judge by the complexion of the sky
 the state and inclination of the day
 so may you by my dull and heavy eye
 my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
 i play the torturer by small and small
 to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
 your uncle york is join'd with bolingbroke
 and all your northern castles yielded up
 and all your southern gentlemen in arms
 upon his party
king richard ii thou hast said enough
 beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
 to duke of aumerle
 of that sweet way i was in to despair
 what say you now what comfort have we now
 by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly
 that bids me be of comfort any more
 go to flint castle there i'll pine away
 a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey
 that power i have discharge and let them go
 to ear the land that hath some hope to grow
 for i have none let no man speak again
 to alter this for counsel is but vain
duke of aumerle my liege one word
king richard ii he does me double wrong
 that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
 discharge my followers let them hence away
 from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day
 exeunt

 richard not far from hence hath hid his head
duke of york it would beseem the lord northumberland
 to say king richard alack the heavy day
 when such a sacred king should hide his head
northumberland your grace mistakes only to be brief
 left i his title out
duke of york the time hath been
 would you have been so brief with him he would
 have been so brief with you to shorten you
 for taking so the head your whole head's length
henry bolingbroke mistake not uncle further than you should
duke of york take not good cousin further than you should
 lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads
henry bolingbroke i know it uncle and oppose not myself
 against their will but who comes here
 enter henry percy
 welcome harry what will not this castle yield
henry percy the castle royally is mann'd my lord
 against thy entrance
henry bolingbroke royally
 why it contains no king
henry percy yes my good lord
 it doth contain a king king richard lies
 within the limits of yon lime and stone
 and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury
 sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman
 of holy reverence who i cannot learn
northumberland o belike it is the bishop of carlisle
henry bolingbroke noble lords
 go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
 through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
 into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver
 henry bolingbroke
 on both his knees doth kiss king richard's hand
 and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
 to his most royal person hither come
 even at his feet to lay my arms and power
 provided that my banishment repeal'd
 and lands restored again be freely granted
 if not i'll use the advantage of my power
 and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
 rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen
 the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
 it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
 the fresh green lap of fair king richard's land
 my stooping duty tenderly shall show
 go signify as much while here we march
 upon the grassy carpet of this plain
 let's march without the noise of threatening drum
 that from this castle's tatter'd battlements
 our fair appointments may be well perused
 methinks king richard and myself should meet
 with no less terror than the elements
 of fire and water when their thundering shock
 at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
 be he the fire i'll be the yielding water
 the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain
 my waters on the earth and not on him
 march on and mark king richard how he looks
 parle without and answer within then a flourish
 enter on the walls king richard ii the bishop of
 carlisle duke of aumerle sir stephen scroop and
 earl of salisbury
 see see king richard doth himself appear
 as doth the blushing discontented sun
 from out the fiery portal of the east
 when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
 to dim his glory and to stain the track
 of his bright passage to the occident
duke of york yet looks he like a king behold his eye
 as bright as is the eagle's lightens forth
 controlling majesty alack alack for woe
 that any harm should stain so fair a show
king richard ii we are amazed and thus long have we stood
 to watch the fearful bending of thy knee
 to northumberland
 because we thought ourself thy lawful king
 and if we be how dare thy joints forget
 to pay their awful duty to our presence
 if we be not show us the hand of god
 that hath dismissed us from our stewardship
 for well we know no hand of blood and bone
 can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
 unless he do profane steal or usurp
 and though you think that all as you have done
 have torn their souls by turning them from us
 and we are barren and bereft of friends
 yet know my master god omnipotent
 is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
 armies of pestilence and they shall strike
 your children yet unborn and unbegot
 that lift your vassal hands against my head
 and threat the glory of my precious crown
 tell bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands
 that every stride he makes upon my land
 is dangerous treason he is come to open
 the purple testament of bleeding war
 but ere the crown he looks for live in peace
 ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
 shall ill become the flower of england's face
 change the complexion of her maidpale peace
 to scarlet indignation and bedew
 her pastures grass with faithful english blood
northumberland the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
 should so with civil and uncivil arms
 be rush'd upon thy thrice noble cousin
 harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
 and by the honourable tomb he swears
 that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones
 and by the royalties of both your bloods
 currents that spring from one most gracious head
 and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt
 and by the worth and honour of himself
 comprising all that may be sworn or said
 his coming hither hath no further scope
 than for his lineal royalties and to beg
 enfranchisement immediate on his knees
 which on thy royal party granted once
 his glittering arms he will commend to rust
 his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
 to faithful service of your majesty
 this swears he as he is a prince is just
 and as i am a gentleman i credit him
king richard ii northumberland say thus the king returns
 his noble cousin is right welcome hither
 and all the number of his fair demands
 shall be accomplish'd without contradiction
 with all the gracious utterance thou hast
 speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
 we do debase ourselves cousin do we not
 to duke of aumerle
 to look so poorly and to speak so fair
 shall we call back northumberland and send
 defiance to the traitor and so die
duke of aumerle no good my lord let's fight with gentle words
 till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
king richard ii o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine
 that laid the sentence of dread banishment
 on yon proud man should take it off again
 with words of sooth o that i were as great
 as is my grief or lesser than my name
 or that i could forget what i have been
 or not remember what i must be now
 swell'st thou proud heart i'll give thee scope to beat
 since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
duke of aumerle northumberland comes back from bolingbroke
king richard ii what must the king do now must he submit
 the king shall do it must he be deposed
 the king shall be contented must he lose
 the name of king o god's name let it go
 i'll give my jewels for a set of beads
 my gorgeous palace for a hermitage
 my gay apparel for an almsman's gown
 my figured goblets for a dish of wood
 my sceptre for a palmer's walking staff
 my subjects for a pair of carved saints
 and my large kingdom for a little grave
 a little little grave an obscure grave
 or i'll be buried in the king's highway
 some way of common trade where subjects feet
 may hourly trample on their sovereign's head
 for on my heart they tread now whilst i live
 and buried once why not upon my head
 aumerle thou weep'st my tenderhearted cousin
 we'll make foul weather with despised tears
 our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
 and make a dearth in this revolting land
 or shall we play the wantons with our woes
 and make some pretty match with shedding tears
 as thus to drop them still upon one place
 till they have fretted us a pair of graves
 within the earth and therein laidthere lies
 two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes
 would not this ill do well well well i see
 i talk but idly and you laugh at me
 most mighty prince my lord northumberland
 what says king bolingbroke will his majesty
 give richard leave to live till richard die
 you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay
northumberland my lord in the base court he doth attend
 to speak with you may it please you to come down
king richard ii down down i come like glistering phaethon
 wanting the manage of unruly jades
 in the base court base court where kings grow base
 to come at traitors calls and do them grace
 in the base court come down down court
 down king
 for nightowls shriek where mounting larks
 should sing
 exeunt from above
henry bolingbroke what says his majesty
northumberland sorrow and grief of heart
 makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
 yet he is come
 enter king richard and his attendants below
henry bolingbroke stand all apart
 and show fair duty to his majesty
 he kneels down
 my gracious lord
king richard ii fair cousin you debase your princely knee
 to make the base earth proud with kissing it
 me rather had my heart might feel your love
 than my unpleased eye see your courtesy
 up cousin up your heart is up i know
 thus high at least although your knee be low
henry bolingbroke my gracious lord i come but for mine own
king richard ii your own is yours and i am yours and all
henry bolingbroke so far be mine my most redoubted lord
 as my true service shall deserve your love
king richard ii well you deserve they well deserve to have
 that know the strong'st and surest way to get
 uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes
 tears show their love but want their remedies

 though you are old enough to be my heir
 what you will have i'll give and willing too
 for do we must what force will have us do
 set on towards london cousin is it so
henry bolingbroke yea my good lord
king richard ii then i must not say no

act iii
scene iv langley the duke of york's garden
 enter the queen and two ladies
queen what sport shall we devise here in this garden
 to drive away the heavy thought of care
lady madam we'll play at bowls
queen twill make me think the world is full of rubs
 and that my fortune rubs against the bias
lady madam we'll dance
queen my legs can keep no measure in delight
 when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
 therefore no dancing girl some other sport
lady madam we'll tell tales
queen of sorrow or of joy
lady of either madam
queen of neither girl
 for of joy being altogether wanting
 it doth remember me the more of sorrow
 or if of grief being altogether had
 it adds more sorrow to my want of joy
 for what i have i need not to repeat
 and what i want it boots not to complain
lady madam i'll sing
queen tis well that thou hast cause
 but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
lady i could weep madam would it do you good
queen and i could sing would weeping do me good
 and never borrow any tear of thee
 enter a gardener and two servants
 but stay here come the gardeners
 let's step into the shadow of these trees
 my wretchedness unto a row of pins
 they'll talk of state for every one doth so
 against a change woe is forerun with woe
 queen and ladies retire
gardener go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
 which like unruly children make their sire
 stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
 give some supportance to the bending twigs
 go thou and like an executioner
 cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
 that look too lofty in our commonwealth
 all must be even in our government
 you thus employ'd i will go root away
 the noisome weeds which without profit suck
 the soil's fertility from wholesome flowers
servant why should we in the compass of a pale
 keep law and form and due proportion
 showing as in a model our firm estate
 when our seawalled garden the whole land
 is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up
 her fruittrees all upturned her hedges ruin'd
 her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
 swarming with caterpillars
gardener hold thy peace
 he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
 hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
 the weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter
 that seem'd in eating him to hold him up
 are pluck'd up root and all by bolingbroke
 i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green
servant what are they dead
gardener they are and bolingbroke
 hath seized the wasteful king o what pity is it
 that he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
 as we this garden we at time of year
 do wound the bark the skin of our fruittrees
 lest being overproud in sap and blood
 with too much riches it confound itself
 had he done so to great and growing men
 they might have lived to bear and he to taste
 their fruits of duty superfluous branches
 we lop away that bearing boughs may live
 had he done so himself had borne the crown
 which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
servant what think you then the king shall be deposed
gardener depress'd he is already and deposed
 tis doubt he will be letters came last night
 to a dear friend of the good duke of york's
 that tell black tidings
queen o i am press'd to death through want of speaking
 coming forward
 thou old adam's likeness set to dress this garden
 how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
 what eve what serpent hath suggested thee
 to make a second fall of cursed man
 why dost thou say king richard is deposed
 darest thou thou little better thing than earth
 divine his downfall say where when and how
 camest thou by this ill tidings speak thou wretch
gardener pardon me madam little joy have i
 to breathe this news yet what i say is true
 king richard he is in the mighty hold
 of bolingbroke their fortunes both are weigh'd
 in your lord's scale is nothing but himself
 and some few vanities that make him light
 but in the balance of great bolingbroke
 besides himself are all the english peers
 and with that odds he weighs king richard down
 post you to london and you will find it so
 i speak no more than every one doth know
queen nimble mischance that art so light of foot
 doth not thy embassage belong to me
 and am i last that knows it o thou think'st
 to serve me last that i may longest keep
 thy sorrow in my breast come ladies go
 to meet at london london's king in woe
 what was i born to this that my sad look
 should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke
 gardener for telling me these news of woe
 pray god the plants thou graft'st may never grow
 exeunt queen and ladies
gardener poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
 i would my skill were subject to thy curse
 here did she fall a tear here in this place
 i'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
 rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
 in the remembrance of a weeping queen
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act iv
scene i westminster hall
 enter as to the parliament henry bolingbroke
 duke of aumerle northumberland henry percy lord
 fitzwater duke of surrey the bishop of carlisle
 the abbot of westminster and another lord herald
 officers and bagot
henry bolingbroke call forth bagot
 now bagot freely speak thy mind
 what thou dost know of noble gloucester's death
 who wrought it with the king and who perform'd
 the bloody office of his timeless end
bagot then set before my face the lord aumerle
henry bolingbroke cousin stand forth and look upon that man
bagot my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue
 scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd
 in that dead time when gloucester's death was plotted
 i heard you say is not my arm of length
 that reacheth from the restful english court
 as far as calais to mine uncle's head'
 amongst much other talk that very time
 i heard you say that you had rather refuse
 the offer of an hundred thousand crowns
 than bolingbroke's return to england
 adding withal how blest this land would be
 in this your cousin's death
duke of aumerle princes and noble lords
 what answer shall i make to this base man
 shall i so much dishonour my fair stars
 on equal terms to give him chastisement
 either i must or have mine honour soil'd
 with the attainder of his slanderous lips
 there is my gage the manual seal of death
 that marks thee out for hell i say thou liest
 and will maintain what thou hast said is false
 in thy heartblood though being all too base
 to stain the temper of my knightly sword
henry bolingbroke bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up
duke of aumerle excepting one i would he were the best
 in all this presence that hath moved me so
lord fitzwater if that thy valour stand on sympathy
 there is my gage aumerle in gage to thine
 by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st
 i heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it
 that thou wert cause of noble gloucester's death
 if thou deny'st it twenty times thou liest
 and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
 where it was forged with my rapier's point
duke of aumerle thou darest not coward live to see that day
lord fitzwater now by my soul i would it were this hour
duke of aumerle fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this
henry percy aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
 in this appeal as thou art all unjust
 and that thou art so there i throw my gage
 to prove it on thee to the extremest point
 of mortal breathing seize it if thou darest
duke of aumerle an if i do not may my hands rot off
 and never brandish more revengeful steel
 over the glittering helmet of my foe
lord i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle
 and spur thee on with full as many lies
 as may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
 from sun to sun there is my honour's pawn
 engage it to the trial if thou darest
duke of aumerle who sets me else by heaven i'll throw at all
 i have a thousand spirits in one breast
 to answer twenty thousand such as you
duke of surrey my lord fitzwater i do remember well
 the very time aumerle and you did talk
lord fitzwater tis very true you were in presence then
 and you can witness with me this is true
duke of surrey as false by heaven as heaven itself is true
lord fitzwater surrey thou liest
duke of surrey dishonourable boy
 that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
 that it shall render vengeance and revenge
 till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie
 in earth as quiet as thy father's skull
 in proof whereof there is my honour's pawn
 engage it to the trial if thou darest
lord fitzwater how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
 if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live
 i dare meet surrey in a wilderness
 and spit upon him whilst i say he lies
 and lies and lies there is my bond of faith
 to tie thee to my strong correction
 as i intend to thrive in this new world
 aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
 besides i heard the banish'd norfolk say
 that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men
 to execute the noble duke at calais
duke of aumerle some honest christian trust me with a gage
 that norfolk lies here do i throw down this
 if he may be repeal'd to try his honour
henry bolingbroke these differences shall all rest under gage
 till norfolk be repeal'd repeal'd he shall be
 and though mine enemy restored again
 to all his lands and signories when he's return'd
 against aumerle we will enforce his trial
bishop of carlisle that honourable day shall ne'er be seen
 many a time hath banish'd norfolk fought
 for jesu christ in glorious christian field
 streaming the ensign of the christian cross
 against black pagans turks and saracens
 and toil'd with works of war retired himself
 to italy and there at venice gave
 his body to that pleasant country's earth
 and his pure soul unto his captain christ
 under whose colours he had fought so long
henry bolingbroke why bishop is norfolk dead
bishop of carlisle as surely as i live my lord
henry bolingbroke sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
 of good old abraham lords appellants
 your differences shall all rest under gage
 till we assign you to your days of trial
 enter duke of york attended
duke of york great duke of lancaster i come to thee
 from plumepluck'd richard who with willing soul
 adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
 to the possession of thy royal hand
 ascend his throne descending now from him
 and long live henry fourth of that name
henry bolingbroke in god's name i'll ascend the regal throne
bishop of carlisle marry god forbid
 worst in this royal presence may i speak
 yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
 would god that any in this noble presence
 were enough noble to be upright judge
 of noble richard then true noblesse would
 learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
 what subject can give sentence on his king
 and who sits here that is not richard's subject
 thieves are not judged but they are by to hear
 although apparent guilt be seen in them
 and shall the figure of god's majesty
 his captain steward deputyelect
 anointed crowned planted many years
 be judged by subject and inferior breath
 and he himself not present o forfend it god
 that in a christian climate souls refined
 should show so heinous black obscene a deed
 i speak to subjects and a subject speaks
 stirr'd up by god thus boldly for his king
 my lord of hereford here whom you call king
 is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king
 and if you crown him let me prophesy
 the blood of english shall manure the ground
 and future ages groan for this foul act
 peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels
 and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
 shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
 disorder horror fear and mutiny
 shall here inhabit and this land be call'd
 the field of golgotha and dead men's skulls
 o if you raise this house against this house
 it will the woefullest division prove
 that ever fell upon this cursed earth
 prevent it resist it let it not be so
 lest child child's children cry against you woe
northumberland well have you argued sir and for your pains
 of capital treason we arrest you here
 my lord of westminster be it your charge
 to keep him safely till his day of trial
 may it please you lords to grant the commons suit
henry bolingbroke fetch hither richard that in common view
 he may surrender so we shall proceed
 without suspicion
duke of york i will be his conduct
 exit
henry bolingbroke lords you that here are under our arrest
 procure your sureties for your days of answer
 little are we beholding to your love
 and little look'd for at your helping hands
 reenter duke of york with king richard ii and
 officers bearing the regalia
king richard ii alack why am i sent for to a king
 before i have shook off the regal thoughts
 wherewith i reign'd i hardly yet have learn'd
 to insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs
 give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
 to this submission yet i well remember
 the favours of these men were they not mine
 did they not sometime cry all hail to me
 so judas did to christ but he in twelve
 found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none
 god save the king will no man say amen
 am i both priest and clerk well then amen
 god save the king although i be not he
 and yet amen if heaven do think him me
 to do what service am i sent for hither
duke of york to do that office of thine own good will
 which tired majesty did make thee offer
 the resignation of thy state and crown
 to henry bolingbroke
king richard ii give me the crown here cousin seize the crown
 here cousin
 on this side my hand and on that side yours
 now is this golden crown like a deep well
 that owes two buckets filling one another
 the emptier ever dancing in the air
 the other down unseen and full of water
 that bucket down and full of tears am i
 drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
henry bolingbroke i thought you had been willing to resign
king richard ii my crown i am but still my griefs are mine
 you may my glories and my state depose
 but not my griefs still am i king of those
henry bolingbroke part of your cares you give me with your crown
king richard ii your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
 my care is loss of care by old care done
 your care is gain of care by new care won
 the cares i give i have though given away
 they tend the crown yet still with me they stay
henry bolingbroke are you contented to resign the crown
king richard ii ay no no ay for i must nothing be
 therefore no no for i resign to thee
 now mark me how i will undo myself
 i give this heavy weight from off my head
 and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
 the pride of kingly sway from out my heart
 with mine own tears i wash away my balm
 with mine own hands i give away my crown
 with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
 with mine own breath release all duty's rites
 all pomp and majesty i do forswear
 my manors rents revenues i forego
 my acts decrees and statutes i deny
 god pardon all oaths that are broke to me
 god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee
 make me that nothing have with nothing grieved
 and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved
 long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit
 and soon lie richard in an earthly pit
 god save king harry unking'd richard says
 and send him many years of sunshine days
 what more remains
northumberland no more but that you read
 these accusations and these grievous crimes
 committed by your person and your followers
 against the state and profit of this land
 that by confessing them the souls of men
 may deem that you are worthily deposed
king richard ii must i do so and must i ravel out
 my weavedup folly gentle northumberland
 if thy offences were upon record
 would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
 to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst
 there shouldst thou find one heinous article
 containing the deposing of a king
 and cracking the strong warrant of an oath
 mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven
 nay all of you that stand and look upon
 whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
 though some of you with pilate wash your hands
 showing an outward pity yet you pilates
 have here deliver'd me to my sour cross
 and water cannot wash away your sin
northumberland my lord dispatch read o'er these articles
king richard ii mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see
 and yet salt water blinds them not so much
 but they can see a sort of traitors here
 nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself
 i find myself a traitor with the rest
 for i have given here my soul's consent
 to undeck the pompous body of a king
 made glory base and sovereignty a slave
 proud majesty a subject state a peasant
northumberland my lord
king richard ii no lord of thine thou haught insulting man
 nor no man's lord i have no name no title
 no not that name was given me at the font
 but tis usurp'd alack the heavy day
 that i have worn so many winters out
 and know not now what name to call myself
 o that i were a mockery king of snow
 standing before the sun of bolingbroke
 to melt myself away in waterdrops
 good king great king and yet not greatly good
 an if my word be sterling yet in england
 let it command a mirror hither straight
 that it may show me what a face i have
 since it is bankrupt of his majesty
henry bolingbroke go some of you and fetch a lookingglass
 exit an attendant
northumberland read o'er this paper while the glass doth come
king richard ii fiend thou torment'st me ere i come to hell
henry bolingbroke urge it no more my lord northumberland
northumberland the commons will not then be satisfied
king richard ii they shall be satisfied i'll read enough
 when i do see the very book indeed
 where all my sins are writ and that's myself
 reenter attendant with a glass
 give me the glass and therein will i read
 no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck
 so many blows upon this face of mine
 and made no deeper wounds o flattering glass
 like to my followers in prosperity
 thou dost beguile me was this face the face
 that every day under his household roof
 did keep ten thousand men was this the face
 that like the sun did make beholders wink
 was this the face that faced so many follies
 and was at last outfaced by bolingbroke
 a brittle glory shineth in this face
 as brittle as the glory is the face
 dashes the glass against the ground
 for there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers
 mark silent king the moral of this sport
 how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face
henry bolingbroke the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
 the shadow or your face
king richard ii say that again
 the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see
 tis very true my grief lies all within
 and these external manners of laments
 are merely shadows to the unseen grief
 that swells with silence in the tortured soul
 there lies the substance and i thank thee king
 for thy great bounty that not only givest
 me cause to wail but teachest me the way
 how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon
 and then be gone and trouble you no more
 shall i obtain it
henry bolingbroke name it fair cousin
king richard ii fair cousin i am greater than a king
 for when i was a king my flatterers
 were then but subjects being now a subject
 i have a king here to my flatterer
 being so great i have no need to beg
henry bolingbroke yet ask
king richard ii and shall i have
henry bolingbroke you shall
king richard ii then give me leave to go
henry bolingbroke whither
king richard ii whither you will so i were from your sights
henry bolingbroke go some of you convey him to the tower
king richard ii o good convey conveyers are you all
 that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall
 exeunt king richard ii some lords and a guard
henry bolingbroke on wednesday next we solemnly set down
 our coronation lords prepare yourselves
 exeunt all except the bishop of carlisle the abbot
 of westminster and duke of aumerle
abbot a woeful pageant have we here beheld
bishop of carlisle the woe's to come the children yet unborn
 shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
duke of aumerle you holy clergymen is there no plot
 to rid the realm of this pernicious blot
abbot my lord
 before i freely speak my mind herein
 you shall not only take the sacrament
 to bury mine intents but also to effect
 whatever i shall happen to devise

 your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
 come home with me to supper and i'll lay
 a plot shall show us all a merry day
 exeunt

act v
scene i london a street leading to the tower
 enter queen and ladies
queen this way the king will come this is the way
 to julius caesar's illerected tower
 to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
 is doom'd a prisoner by proud bolingbroke
 here let us rest if this rebellious earth
 have any resting for her true king's queen
 enter king richard ii and guard
 but soft but see or rather do not see
 my fair rose wither yet look up behold
 that you in pity may dissolve to dew
 and wash him fresh again with truelove tears
 ah thou the model where old troy did stand
 thou map of honour thou king richard's tomb
 and not king richard thou most beauteous inn
 why should hardfavour'd grief be lodged in thee
 when triumph is become an alehouse guest
king richard ii join not with grief fair woman do not so
 to make my end too sudden learn good soul
 to think our former state a happy dream
 from which awaked the truth of what we are
 shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet
 to grim necessity and he and i
 will keep a league till death hie thee to france
 and cloister thee in some religious house
 our holy lives must win a new world's crown
 which our profane hours here have stricken down
queen what is my richard both in shape and mind
 transform'd and weaken'd hath bolingbroke deposed
 thine intellect hath he been in thy heart
 the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
 and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
 to be o'erpower'd and wilt thou pupillike
 take thy correction mildly kiss the rod
 and fawn on rage with base humility
 which art a lion and a king of beasts
king richard ii a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
 i had been still a happy king of men
 good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france
 think i am dead and that even here thou takest
 as from my deathbed thy last living leave
 in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
 with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
 of woeful ages long ago betid
 and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
 tell thou the lamentable tale of me
 and send the hearers weeping to their beds
 for why the senseless brands will sympathize
 the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
 and in compassion weep the fire out
 and some will mourn in ashes some coalblack
 for the deposing of a rightful king
 enter northumberland and others
northumberland my lord the mind of bolingbroke is changed
 you must to pomfret not unto the tower
 and madam there is order ta'en for you
 with all swift speed you must away to france
king richard ii northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
 the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne
 the time shall not be many hours of age
 more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
 shalt break into corruption thou shalt think
 though he divide the realm and give thee half
 it is too little helping him to all
 and he shall think that thou which know'st the way
 to plant unrightful kings wilt know again
 being ne'er so little urged another way
 to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
 the love of wicked men converts to fear
 that fear to hate and hate turns one or both
 to worthy danger and deserved death
northumberland my guilt be on my head and there an end
 take leave and part for you must part forthwith
king richard ii doubly divorced bad men you violate
 a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me
 and then betwixt me and my married wife
 let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
 and yet not so for with a kiss twas made
 part us northumberland i toward the north
 where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
 my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp
 she came adorned hither like sweet may
 sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day
queen and must we be divided must we part
king richard ii ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
queen banish us both and send the king with me
northumberland that were some love but little policy
queen then whither he goes thither let me go
king richard ii so two together weeping make one woe
 weep thou for me in france i for thee here
 better far off than near be ne'er the near
 go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans
queen so longest way shall have the longest moans
king richard ii twice for one step i'll groan the way being short
 and piece the way out with a heavy heart
 come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief
 since wedding it there is such length in grief
 one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
 thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart
queen give me mine own again twere no good part
 to take on me to keep and kill thy heart
 so now i have mine own again be gone
 that i might strive to kill it with a groan
king richard ii we make woe wanton with this fond delay
 once more adieu the rest let sorrow say
 exeunt

act v
scene ii the duke of york's palace
 enter duke of york and duchess of york
duchess of york my lord you told me you would tell the rest
 when weeping made you break the story off
 of our two cousins coming into london
duke of york where did i leave
duchess of york at that sad stop my lord
 where rude misgovern'd hands from windows tops
 threw dust and rubbish on king richard's head
duke of york then as i said the duke great bolingbroke
 mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
 which his aspiring rider seem'd to know
 with slow but stately pace kept on his course
 whilst all tongues cried god save thee
 bolingbroke'
 you would have thought the very windows spake
 so many greedy looks of young and old
 through casements darted their desiring eyes
 upon his visage and that all the walls
 with painted imagery had said at once
 jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke'
 whilst he from the one side to the other turning
 bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck
 bespake them thus i thank you countrymen'
 and thus still doing thus he pass'd along
duchess of york alack poor richard where rode he the whilst
duke of york as in a theatre the eyes of men
 after a wellgraced actor leaves the stage
 are idly bent on him that enters next
 thinking his prattle to be tedious
 even so or with much more contempt men's eyes
 did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him'
 no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
 but dust was thrown upon his sacred head
 which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
 his face still combating with tears and smiles
 the badges of his grief and patience
 that had not god for some strong purpose steel'd
 the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
 and barbarism itself have pitied him
 but heaven hath a hand in these events
 to whose high will we bound our calm contents
 to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
 whose state and honour i for aye allow
duchess of york here comes my son aumerle
duke of york aumerle that was
 but that is lost for being richard's friend
 and madam you must call him rutland now
 i am in parliament pledge for his truth
 and lasting fealty to the newmade king

 which for some reasons i would not have seen
duke of york which for some reasons sir i mean to see
 i fear i fear
duchess of york what should you fear
 tis nothing but some bond that he is enter'd into
 for gay apparel gainst the triumph day
duke of york bound to himself what doth he with a bond
 that he is bound to wife thou art a fool
 boy let me see the writing
duke of aumerle i do beseech you pardon me i may not show it

duchess of york why york what wilt thou do
 wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
 have we more sons or are we like to have
 is not my teeming date drunk up with time
 and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
 and rob me of a happy mother's name
 is he not like thee is he not thine own
duke of york thou fond mad woman
 wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
 a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament
 and interchangeably set down their hands
 to kill the king at oxford
duchess of york he shall be none
 we'll keep him here then what is that to him
duke of york away fond woman were he twenty times my son
 i would appeach him
duchess of york hadst thou groan'd for him
 as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
 but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect
 that i have been disloyal to thy bed
 and that he is a bastard not thy son
 sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind
 he is as like thee as a man may be
 not like to me or any of my kin
 and yet i love him
duke of york make way unruly woman
 exit
duchess of york after aumerle mount thee upon his horse
 spur post and get before him to the king
 and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
 i'll not be long behind though i be old
 i doubt not but to ride as fast as york
 and never will i rise up from the ground
 till bolingbroke have pardon'd thee away be gone

scene iii a royal palace
 enter henry bolingbroke henry percy and other lords
henry bolingbroke can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
 tis full three months since i did see him last
 if any plague hang over us tis he
 i would to god my lords he might be found
 inquire at london mongst the taverns there
 for there they say he daily doth frequent
 with unrestrained loose companions
 even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
 and beat our watch and rob our passengers
 which he young wanton and effeminate boy
 takes on the point of honour to support
 so dissolute a crew
henry percy my lord some two days since i saw the prince
 and told him of those triumphs held at oxford
henry bolingbroke and what said the gallant
henry percy his answer was he would unto the stews
 and from the common'st creature pluck a glove
 and wear it as a favour and with that
 he would unhorse the lustiest challenger
henry bolingbroke as dissolute as desperate yet through both
 i see some sparks of better hope which elder years
 may happily bring forth but who comes here
 enter duke of aumerle
duke of aumerle where is the king
henry bolingbroke what means our cousin that he stares and looks
 so wildly
duke of aumerle god save your grace i do beseech your majesty
 to have some conference with your grace alone
henry bolingbroke withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
 exeunt henry percy and lords
 what is the matter with our cousin now
duke of aumerle for ever may my knees grow to the earth
 my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
 unless a pardon ere i rise or speak
henry bolingbroke intended or committed was this fault
 if on the first how heinous e'er it be
 to win thy afterlove i pardon thee
duke of aumerle then give me leave that i may turn the key
 that no man enter till my tale be done
henry bolingbroke have thy desire
duke of york within my liege beware look to thyself
 thou hast a traitor in thy presence there
henry bolingbroke villain i'll make thee safe

 enter duke of york
henry bolingbroke what is the matter uncle speak
 recover breath tell us how near is danger
 that we may arm us to encounter it
duke of york peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
 the treason that my haste forbids me show
duke of aumerle remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd
 i do repent me read not my name there
 my heart is not confederate with my hand
duke of york it was villain ere thy hand did set it down
 i tore it from the traitor's bosom king
 fear and not love begets his penitence
 forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
 a serpent that will sting thee to the heart
henry bolingbroke o heinous strong and bold conspiracy
 o loyal father of a treacherous son
 thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
 from when this stream through muddy passages
 hath held his current and defiled himself
 thy overflow of good converts to bad
 and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
 this deadly blot in thy digressing son
duke of york so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd
 and he shall spend mine honour with his shame
 as thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold
 mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
 or my shamed life in his dishonour lies
 thou kill'st me in his life giving him breath
 the traitor lives the true man's put to death
duchess of york within what ho my liege for god's sake
 let me in
henry bolingbroke what shrillvoiced suppliant makes this eager cry
duchess of york a woman and thy aunt great king tis i
 speak with me pity me open the door
 a beggar begs that never begg'd before
henry bolingbroke our scene is alter'd from a serious thing
 and now changed to the beggar and the king'
 my dangerous cousin let your mother in
 i know she is come to pray for your foul sin
duke of york if thou do pardon whosoever pray
 more sins for this forgiveness prosper may
 this fester'd joint cut off the rest rest sound
 this let alone will all the rest confound
 enter duchess of york
duchess of york o king believe not this hardhearted man
 love loving not itself none other can
duke of york thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
 shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
duchess of york sweet york be patient hear me gentle liege
 kneels
henry bolingbroke rise up good aunt
duchess of york not yet i thee beseech
 for ever will i walk upon my knees
 and never see day that the happy sees
 till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
 by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy
duke of aumerle unto my mother's prayers i bend my knee
duke of york against them both my true joints bended be
 ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
duchess of york pleads he in earnest look upon his face
 his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
 his words come from his mouth ours from our breast
 he prays but faintly and would be denied
 we pray with heart and soul and all beside
 his weary joints would gladly rise i know
 our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow
 his prayers are full of false hypocrisy
 ours of true zeal and deep integrity
 our prayers do outpray his then let them have
 that mercy which true prayer ought to have
henry bolingbroke good aunt stand up
duchess of york nay do not say stand up'
 say pardon first and afterwards stand up'
 and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
 pardon should be the first word of thy speech
 i never long'd to hear a word till now
 say pardon king let pity teach thee how
 the word is short but not so short as sweet
 no word like pardon for kings mouths so meet
duke of york speak it in french king say pardonne moi'
duchess of york dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
 ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord
 that set'st the word itself against the word
 speak pardon as tis current in our land
 the chopping french we do not understand
 thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
 or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
 that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
 pity may move thee pardon to rehearse
henry bolingbroke good aunt stand up
duchess of york i do not sue to stand
 pardon is all the suit i have in hand
henry bolingbroke i pardon him as god shall pardon me
duchess of york o happy vantage of a kneeling knee
 yet am i sick for fear speak it again
 twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain
 but makes one pardon strong
henry bolingbroke with all my heart
 i pardon him
duchess of york a god on earth thou art
henry bolingbroke but for our trusty brotherinlaw and the abbot
 with all the rest of that consorted crew
 destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
 good uncle help to order several powers
 to oxford or where'er these traitors are
 they shall not live within this world i swear
 but i will have them if i once know where
 uncle farewell and cousin too adieu
 your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true
duchess of york come my old son i pray god make thee new

act v
scene v pomfret castle
 enter king richard
king richard ii i have been studying how i may compare
 this prison where i live unto the world
 and for because the world is populous
 and here is not a creature but myself
 i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out
 my brain i'll prove the female to my soul
 my soul the father and these two beget
 a generation of stillbreeding thoughts
 and these same thoughts people this little world
 in humours like the people of this world
 for no thought is contented the better sort
 as thoughts of things divine are intermix'd
 with scruples and do set the word itself
 against the word
 as thus come little ones and then again
 it is as hard to come as for a camel
 to thread the postern of a small needle's eye'
 thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
 unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
 may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
 of this hard world my ragged prison walls
 and for they cannot die in their own pride
 thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
 that they are not the first of fortune's slaves
 nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
 who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
 that many have and others must sit there
 and in this thought they find a kind of ease
 bearing their own misfortunes on the back
 of such as have before endured the like
 thus play i in one person many people
 and none contented sometimes am i king
 then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
 and so i am then crushing penury
 persuades me i was better when a king
 then am i king'd again and by and by
 think that i am unking'd by bolingbroke
 and straight am nothing but whate'er i be
 nor i nor any man that but man is
 with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
 with being nothing music do i hear
 music
 ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is
 when time is broke and no proportion kept
 so is it in the music of men's lives
 and here have i the daintiness of ear
 to cheque time broke in a disorder'd string
 but for the concord of my state and time
 had not an ear to hear my true time broke
 i wasted time and now doth time waste me
 for now hath time made me his numbering clock
 my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
 their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
 whereto my finger like a dial's point
 is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
 now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
 are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
 which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans
 show minutes times and hours but my time
 runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy
 while i stand fooling here his jack o the clock
 this music mads me let it sound no more
 for though it have holp madmen to their wits
 in me it seems it will make wise men mad
 yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
 for tis a sign of love and love to richard
 is a strange brooch in this allhating world
 enter a groom of the stable
groom hail royal prince
king richard ii thanks noble peer
 the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
 what art thou and how comest thou hither
 where no man never comes but that sad dog
 that brings me food to make misfortune live
groom i was a poor groom of thy stable king
 when thou wert king who travelling towards york
 with much ado at length have gotten leave
 to look upon my sometimes royal master's face
 o how it yearn'd my heart when i beheld
 in london streets that coronationday
 when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary
 that horse that thou so often hast bestrid
 that horse that i so carefully have dress'd
king richard ii rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend
 how went he under him
groom so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground
king richard ii so proud that bolingbroke was on his back
 that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
 this hand hath made him proud with clapping him
 would he not stumble would he not fall down
 since pride must have a fall and break the neck
 of that proud man that did usurp his back
 forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee
 since thou created to be awed by man
 wast born to bear i was not made a horse
 and yet i bear a burthen like an ass
 spurr'd gall'd and tired by jouncing bolingbroke
 enter keeper with a dish
keeper fellow give place here is no longer stay
king richard ii if thou love me tis time thou wert away
groom what my tongue dares not that my heart shall say
 exit
keeper my lord will't please you to fall to
king richard ii taste of it first as thou art wont to do
keeper my lord i dare not sir pierce of exton who
 lately came from the king commands the contrary
king richard ii the devil take henry of lancaster and thee
 patience is stale and i am weary of it
 beats the keeper
keeper help help help
 enter exton and servants armed
king richard ii how now what means death in this rude assault
 villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument
 snatching an axe from a servant and killing him
 go thou and fill another room in hell
 he kills another then exton strikes him down
 that hand shall burn in neverquenching fire
 that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand
 hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land
 mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
 whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
 dies
exton as full of valour as of royal blood
 both have i spill'd o would the deed were good
 for now the devil that told me i did well
 says that this deed is chronicled in hell
 this dead king to the living king i'll bear
 take hence the rest and give them burial here

 upon my head and all this famous land
exton from your own mouth my lord did i this deed
henry bolingbroke they love not poison that do poison need
 nor do i thee though i did wish him dead
 i hate the murderer love him murdered
 the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
 but neither my good word nor princely favour
 with cain go wander through shades of night
 and never show thy head by day nor light
 lords i protest my soul is full of woe
 that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
 come mourn with me for that i do lament
 and put on sullen black incontinent
 i'll make a voyage to the holy land
 to wash this blood off from my guilty hand

scene i london a street
 enter gloucester solus
gloucester now is the winter of our discontent
 made glorious summer by this sun of york
 and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
 in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
 now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
 our bruised arms hung up for monuments
 our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
 our dreadful marches to delightful measures
 grimvisaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
 and now instead of mounting barded steeds
 to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
 he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
 to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
 but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks
 nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
 i that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty
 to strut before a wanton ambling nymph
 i that am curtail'd of this fair proportion
 cheated of feature by dissembling nature
 deformed unfinish'd sent before my time
 into this breathing world scarce half made up
 and that so lamely and unfashionable
 that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
 why i in this weak piping time of peace
 have no delight to pass away the time
 unless to spy my shadow in the sun
 and descant on mine own deformity
 and therefore since i cannot prove a lover
 to entertain these fair wellspoken days
 i am determined to prove a villain
 and hate the idle pleasures of these days
 plots have i laid inductions dangerous
 by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
 to set my brother clarence and the king
 in deadly hate the one against the other
 and if king edward be as true and just
 as i am subtle false and treacherous
 this day should clarence closely be mew'd up
 about a prophecy which says that g'
 of edward's heirs the murderer shall be
 dive thoughts down to my soul here
 clarence comes
 enter clarence guarded and brakenbury
 brother good day what means this armed guard
 that waits upon your grace
clarence his majesty
 tendering my person's safety hath appointed
 this conduct to convey me to the tower
gloucester upon what cause
clarence because my name is george
gloucester alack my lord that fault is none of yours
 he should for that commit your godfathers
 o belike his majesty hath some intent
 that you shall be newchristen'd in the tower
 but what's the matter clarence may i know
clarence yea richard when i know for i protest
 as yet i do not but as i can learn
 he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
 and from the crossrow plucks the letter g
 and says a wizard told him that by g
 his issue disinherited should be
 and for my name of george begins with g
 it follows in his thought that i am he
 these as i learn and such like toys as these
 have moved his highness to commit me now
gloucester why this it is when men are ruled by women
 tis not the king that sends you to the tower
 my lady grey his wife clarence tis she
 that tempers him to this extremity
 was it not she and that good man of worship
 anthony woodville her brother there
 that made him send lord hastings to the tower
 from whence this present day he is deliver'd
 we are not safe clarence we are not safe
clarence by heaven i think there's no man is secure
 but the queen's kindred and nightwalking heralds
 that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
 heard ye not what an humble suppliant
 lord hastings was to her for his delivery
gloucester humbly complaining to her deity
 got my lord chamberlain his liberty
 i'll tell you what i think it is our way
 if we will keep in favour with the king
 to be her men and wear her livery
 the jealous o'erworn widow and herself
 since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen
 are mighty gossips in this monarchy
brakenbury i beseech your graces both to pardon me
 his majesty hath straitly given in charge
 that no man shall have private conference
 of what degree soever with his brother
gloucester even so an't please your worship brakenbury
 you may partake of any thing we say
 we speak no treason man we say the king
 is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
 well struck in years fair and not jealous
 we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot
 a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
 and that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks
 how say you sir can you deny all this
brakenbury with this my lord myself have nought to do
gloucester naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow
 he that doth naught with her excepting one
 were best he do it secretly alone
brakenbury what one my lord
gloucester her husband knave wouldst thou betray me
brakenbury i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
 forbear your conference with the noble duke
clarence we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey
gloucester we are the queen's abjects and must obey
 brother farewell i will unto the king
 and whatsoever you will employ me in
 were it to call king edward's widow sister
 i will perform it to enfranchise you
 meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
 touches me deeper than you can imagine
clarence i know it pleaseth neither of us well
gloucester well your imprisonment shall not be long
 meantime have patience
clarence i must perforce farewell
 exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard
gloucester go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return
 simple plain clarence i do love thee so
 that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
 if heaven will take the present at our hands
 but who comes here the newdeliver'd hastings
 enter hastings
hastings good time of day unto my gracious lord
gloucester as much unto my good lord chamberlain
 well are you welcome to the open air
 how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment
hastings with patience noble lord as prisoners must
 but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
 that were the cause of my imprisonment
gloucester no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too
 for they that were your enemies are his
 and have prevail'd as much on him as you
hastings more pity that the eagle should be mew'd
 while kites and buzzards prey at liberty
gloucester what news abroad
hastings no news so bad abroad as this at home
 the king is sickly weak and melancholy
 and his physicians fear him mightily
gloucester now by saint paul this news is bad indeed
 o he hath kept an evil diet long
 and overmuch consumed his royal person
 tis very grievous to be thought upon
 what is he in his bed
hastings he is
gloucester go you before and i will follow you
 exit hastings
 he cannot live i hope and must not die
 till george be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven
 i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence
 with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments
 and if i fall not in my deep intent
 clarence hath not another day to live
 which done god take king edward to his mercy
 and leave the world for me to bustle in
 for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter
 what though i kill'd her husband and her father
 the readiest way to make the wench amends
 is to become her husband and her father
 the which will i not all so much for love
 as for another secret close intent
 by marrying her which i must reach unto
 but yet i run before my horse to market
 clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns
 when they are gone then must i count my gains
 exit
 king richard iii
act i
scene ii the same another street
 enter the corpse of king henry the sixth gentlemen
 with halberds to guard it lady anne being the mourner
lady anne set down set down your honourable load
 if honour may be shrouded in a hearse
 whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
 the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
 poor keycold figure of a holy king
 pale ashes of the house of lancaster
 thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
 be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost
 to hear the lamentations of poor anne
 wife to thy edward to thy slaughter'd son
 stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
 lo in these windows that let forth thy life
 i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
 cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes
 cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it
 cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
 more direful hap betide that hated wretch
 that makes us wretched by the death of thee
 than i can wish to adders spiders toads
 or any creeping venom'd thing that lives
 if ever he have child abortive be it
 prodigious and untimely brought to light
 whose ugly and unnatural aspect
 may fright the hopeful mother at the view
 and that be heir to his unhappiness
 if ever he have wife let her he made
 a miserable by the death of him
 as i am made by my poor lord and thee
 come now towards chertsey with your holy load
 taken from paul's to be interred there
 and still as you are weary of the weight
 rest you whiles i lament king henry's corse
 enter gloucester
gloucester stay you that bear the corse and set it down
lady anne what black magician conjures up this fiend
 to stop devoted charitable deeds
gloucester villains set down the corse or by saint paul
 i'll make a corse of him that disobeys
gentleman my lord stand back and let the coffin pass
gloucester unmanner'd dog stand thou when i command
 advance thy halbert higher than my breast
 or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot
 and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
lady anne what do you tremble are you all afraid
 alas i blame you not for you are mortal
 and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
 avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
 thou hadst but power over his mortal body
 his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
gloucester sweet saint for charity be not so curst
lady anne foul devil for god's sake hence and trouble us not
 for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
 fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
 if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
 behold this pattern of thy butcheries
 o gentlemen see see dead henry's wounds
 open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh
 blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
 for tis thy presence that exhales this blood
 from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
 thy deed inhuman and unnatural
 provokes this deluge most unnatural
 o god which this blood madest revenge his death
 o earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death
 either heaven with lightning strike the
 murderer dead
 or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
 as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
 which his hellgovern'd arm hath butchered
gloucester lady you know no rules of charity
 which renders good for bad blessings for curses
lady anne villain thou know'st no law of god nor man
 no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
gloucester but i know none and therefore am no beast
lady anne o wonderful when devils tell the truth
gloucester more wonderful when angels are so angry
 vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
 of these supposedevils to give me leave
 by circumstance but to acquit myself
lady anne vouchsafe defused infection of a man
 for these known evils but to give me leave
 by circumstance to curse thy cursed self
gloucester fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
 some patient leisure to excuse myself
lady anne fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
 no excuse current but to hang thyself
gloucester by such despair i should accuse myself
lady anne and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused
 for doing worthy vengeance on thyself
 which didst unworthy slaughter upon others
gloucester say that i slew them not
lady anne why then they are not dead
 but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
gloucester i did not kill your husband
lady anne why then he is alive
gloucester nay he is dead and slain by edward's hand
lady anne in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw
 thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
 the which thou once didst bend against her breast
 but that thy brothers beat aside the point
gloucester i was provoked by her slanderous tongue
 which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
lady anne thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
 which never dreamt on aught but butcheries
 didst thou not kill this king
gloucester i grant ye
lady anne dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too
 thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
 o he was gentle mild and virtuous
gloucester the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him
lady anne he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
gloucester let him thank me that holp to send him thither
 for he was fitter for that place than earth
lady anne and thou unfit for any place but hell
gloucester yes one place else if you will hear me name it
lady anne some dungeon
gloucester your bedchamber
lady anne i'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest
gloucester so will it madam till i lie with you
lady anne i hope so
gloucester i know so but gentle lady anne
 to leave this keen encounter of our wits
 and fall somewhat into a slower method
 is not the causer of the timeless deaths
 of these plantagenets henry and edward
 as blameful as the executioner
lady anne thou art the cause and most accursed effect
gloucester your beauty was the cause of that effect
 your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep
 to undertake the death of all the world
 so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
lady anne if i thought that i tell thee homicide
 these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
gloucester these eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck
 you should not blemish it if i stood by
 as all the world is cheered by the sun
 so i by that it is my day my life
lady anne black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life
gloucester curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
lady anne i would i were to be revenged on thee
gloucester it is a quarrel most unnatural
 to be revenged on him that loveth you
lady anne it is a quarrel just and reasonable
 to be revenged on him that slew my husband
gloucester he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
 did it to help thee to a better husband
lady anne his better doth not breathe upon the earth
gloucester he lives that loves thee better than he could
lady anne name him
gloucester plantagenet
lady anne why that was he
gloucester the selfsame name but one of better nature
lady anne where is he
gloucester here
 she spitteth at him
 why dost thou spit at me
lady anne would it were mortal poison for thy sake
gloucester never came poison from so sweet a place
lady anne never hung poison on a fouler toad
 out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes
gloucester thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
lady anne would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
gloucester i would they were that i might die at once
 for now they kill me with a living death
 those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
 shamed their aspect with store of childish drops
 these eyes that never shed remorseful tear
 no when my father york and edward wept
 to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
 when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him
 nor when thy warlike father like a child
 told the sad story of my father's death
 and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
 that all the standersby had wet their cheeks
 like trees bedash'd with rain in that sad time
 my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
 and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
 thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
 i never sued to friend nor enemy
 my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
 but now thy beauty is proposed my fee
 my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
 she looks scornfully at him
 teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made
 for kissing lady not for such contempt
 if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
 lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword
 which if thou please to hide in this true bosom
 and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
 i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
 and humbly beg the death upon my knee
 he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword
 nay do not pause for i did kill king henry
 but twas thy beauty that provoked me
 nay now dispatch twas i that stabb'd young edward
 but twas thy heavenly face that set me on
 here she lets fall the sword
 take up the sword again or take up me
lady anne arise dissembler though i wish thy death
 i will not be the executioner
gloucester then bid me kill myself and i will do it
lady anne i have already
gloucester tush that was in thy rage
 speak it again and even with the word
 that hand which for thy love did kill thy love
 shall for thy love kill a far truer love
 to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary
lady anne i would i knew thy heart
gloucester tis figured in my tongue
lady anne i fear me both are false
gloucester then never man was true
lady anne well well put up your sword
gloucester say then my peace is made
lady anne that shall you know hereafter
gloucester but shall i live in hope
lady anne all men i hope live so
gloucester vouchsafe to wear this ring
lady anne to take is not to give
gloucester look how this ring encompasseth finger
 even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
 wear both of them for both of them are thine
 and if thy poor devoted suppliant may
 but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
 thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
lady anne what is it
gloucester that it would please thee leave these sad designs
 to him that hath more cause to be a mourner
 and presently repair to crosby place
 where after i have solemnly interr'd
 at chertsey monastery this noble king
 and wet his grave with my repentant tears
 i will with all expedient duty see you
 for divers unknown reasons i beseech you
 grant me this boon
lady anne with all my heart and much it joys me too
 to see you are become so penitent
 tressel and berkeley go along with me
gloucester bid me farewell
lady anne tis more than you deserve
 but since you teach me how to flatter you
 imagine i have said farewell already
 exeunt lady anne tressel and berkeley
gloucester sirs take up the corse
gentlemen towards chertsey noble lord
gloucester no to whitefriars there attend my coining
 exeunt all but gloucester
 was ever woman in this humour woo'd
 was ever woman in this humour won
 i'll have her but i will not keep her long
 what i that kill'd her husband and his father
 to take her in her heart's extremest hate
 with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
 the bleeding witness of her hatred by
 having god her conscience and these bars
 against me
 and i nothing to back my suit at all
 but the plain devil and dissembling looks
 and yet to win her all the world to nothing
 ha
 hath she forgot already that brave prince
 edward her lord whom i some three months since
 stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury
 a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
 framed in the prodigality of nature
 young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
 the spacious world cannot again afford
 and will she yet debase her eyes on me
 that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
 and made her widow to a woful bed
 on me whose all not equals edward's moiety
 on me that halt and am unshapen thus
 my dukedom to a beggarly denier
 i do mistake my person all this while
 upon my life she finds although i cannot
 myself to be a marvellous proper man
 i'll be at charges for a lookingglass
 and entertain some score or two of tailors
 to study fashions to adorn my body
 since i am crept in favour with myself
 will maintain it with some little cost
 but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave
 and then return lamenting to my love
 shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass
 that i may see my shadow as i pass

scene iii the palace
 enter queen elizabeth rivers and grey
rivers have patience madam there's no doubt his majesty
 will soon recover his accustom'd health
grey in that you brook it in it makes him worse
 therefore for god's sake entertain good comfort
 and cheer his grace with quick and merry words
queen elizabeth if he were dead what would betide of me
rivers no other harm but loss of such a lord
queen elizabeth the loss of such a lord includes all harm
grey the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
 to be your comforter when he is gone
queen elizabeth oh he is young and his minority
 is put unto the trust of richard gloucester
 a man that loves not me nor none of you
rivers is it concluded that he shall be protector
queen elizabeth it is determined not concluded yet
 but so it must be if the king miscarry

 yet derby notwithstanding she's your wife
 and loves not me be you good lord assured
 i hate not you for her proud arrogance
derby i do beseech you either not believe
 the envious slanders of her false accusers
 or if she be accused in true report

 from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
rivers saw you the king today my lord of derby

 i fear our happiness is at the highest
 enter gloucester hastings and dorset
gloucester they do me wrong and i will not endure it
 who are they that complain unto the king
 that i forsooth am stern and love them not
 by holy paul they love his grace but lightly
 that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
 because i cannot flatter and speak fair
 smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog
 duck with french nods and apish courtesy
 i must be held a rancorous enemy
 cannot a plain man live and think no harm
 but thus his simple truth must be abused
 by silken sly insinuating jacks
rivers to whom in all this presence speaks your grace
gloucester to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
 when have i injured thee when done thee wrong
 or thee or thee or any of your faction
 a plague upon you all his royal person
 whom god preserve better than you would wish
 cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile
 but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
queen elizabeth brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
 the king of his own royal disposition
 and not provoked by any suitor else
 aiming belike at your interior hatred
 which in your outward actions shows itself
 against my kindred brothers and myself
 makes him to send that thereby he may gather
 the ground of your illwill and so remove it
gloucester i cannot tell the world is grown so bad
 that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
 since every jack became a gentleman
 there's many a gentle person made a jack
queen elizabeth come come we know your meaning brother
 gloucester
 you envy my advancement and my friends'
 god grant we never may have need of you
gloucester meantime god grants that we have need of you
 your brother is imprison'd by your means
 myself disgraced and the nobility
 held in contempt whilst many fair promotions
 are daily given to ennoble those
 that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
queen elizabeth by him that raised me to this careful height
 from that contented hap which i enjoy'd
 i never did incense his majesty
 against the duke of clarence but have been
 an earnest advocate to plead for him
 my lord you do me shameful injury
 falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
gloucester you may deny that you were not the cause
 of my lord hastings late imprisonment
rivers she may my lord for
gloucester she may lord rivers why who knows not so
 she may do more sir than denying that
 she may help you to many fair preferments
 and then deny her aiding hand therein
 and lay those honours on your high deserts
 what may she not she may yea marry may she
rivers what marry may she
gloucester what marry may she marry with a king
 a bachelor a handsome stripling too
 i wis your grandam had a worser match
queen elizabeth my lord of gloucester i have too long borne
 your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
 by heaven i will acquaint his majesty
 with those gross taunts i often have endured
 i had rather be a country servantmaid
 than a great queen with this condition
 to be thus taunted scorn'd and baited at
 enter queen margaret behind
 small joy have i in being england's queen
queen margaret and lessen'd be that small god i beseech thee
 thy honour state and seat is due to me
gloucester what threat you me with telling of the king
 tell him and spare not look what i have said
 i will avouch in presence of the king
 i dare adventure to be sent to the tower
 tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
queen margaret out devil i remember them too well
 thou slewest my husband henry in the tower
 and edward my poor son at tewksbury
gloucester ere you were queen yea or your husband king
 i was a packhorse in his great affairs
 a weederout of his proud adversaries
 a liberal rewarder of his friends
 to royalize his blood i spilt mine own
queen margaret yea and much better blood than his or thine
gloucester in all which time you and your husband grey
 were factious for the house of lancaster
 and rivers so were you was not your husband
 in margaret's battle at saint alban's slain
 let me put in your minds if you forget
 what you have been ere now and what you are
 withal what i have been and what i am
queen margaret a murderous villain and so still thou art
gloucester poor clarence did forsake his father warwick
 yea and forswore himselfwhich jesu pardon
queen margaret which god revenge
gloucester to fight on edward's party for the crown
 and for his meed poor lord he is mew'd up
 i would to god my heart were flint like edward's
 or edward's soft and pitiful like mine
 i am too childishfoolish for this world
queen margaret hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world
 thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
rivers my lord of gloucester in those busy days
 which here you urge to prove us enemies
 we follow'd then our lord our lawful king
 so should we you if you should be our king
gloucester if i should be i had rather be a pedlar
 far be it from my heart the thought of it
queen elizabeth as little joy my lord as you suppose
 you should enjoy were you this country's king
 as little joy may you suppose in me
 that i enjoy being the queen thereof
queen margaret a little joy enjoys the queen thereof
 for i am she and altogether joyless
 i can no longer hold me patient
 advancing
 hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
 in sharing that which you have pill'd from me
 which of you trembles not that looks on me
 if not that i being queen you bow like subjects
 yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels
 o gentle villain do not turn away
gloucester foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight
queen margaret but repetition of what thou hast marr'd
 that will i make before i let thee go
gloucester wert thou not banished on pain of death
queen margaret i was but i do find more pain in banishment
 than death can yield me here by my abode
 a husband and a son thou owest to me
 and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
 the sorrow that i have by right is yours
 and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
gloucester the curse my noble father laid on thee
 when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
 and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes
 and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout
 steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland
 his curses then from bitterness of soul
 denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee
 and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed
queen elizabeth so just is god to right the innocent
hastings o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
 and the most merciless that e'er was heard of
rivers tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
dorset no man but prophesied revenge for it
buckingham northumberland then present wept to see it
queen margaret what were you snarling all before i came
 ready to catch each other by the throat
 and turn you all your hatred now on me
 did york's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
 that henry's death my lovely edward's death
 their kingdom's loss my woful banishment
 could all but answer for that peevish brat
 can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
 why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
 if not by war by surfeit die your king
 as ours by murder to make him a king
 edward thy son which now is prince of wales
 for edward my son which was prince of wales
 die in his youth by like untimely violence
 thyself a queen for me that was a queen
 outlive thy glory like my wretched self
 long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss
 and see another as i see thee now
 deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine
 long die thy happy days before thy death
 and after many lengthen'd hours of grief
 die neither mother wife nor england's queen
 rivers and dorset you were standers by
 and so wast thou lord hastings when my son
 was stabb'd with bloody daggers god i pray him
 that none of you may live your natural age
 but by some unlook'd accident cut off
gloucester have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag
queen margaret and leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
 if heaven have any grievous plague in store
 exceeding those that i can wish upon thee
 o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
 and then hurl down their indignation
 on thee the troubler of the poor world's peace
 the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
 thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest
 and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
 no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
 unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
 affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
 thou elvishmark'd abortive rooting hog
 thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
 the slave of nature and the son of hell
 thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb
 thou loathed issue of thy father's loins
 thou rag of honour thou detested
gloucester margaret
queen margaret richard
gloucester ha
queen margaret i call thee not
gloucester i cry thee mercy then for i had thought
 that thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names
queen margaret why so i did but look'd for no reply
 o let me make the period to my curse
gloucester tis done by me and ends in margaret'
queen elizabeth thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
queen margaret poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
 why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
 whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
 fool fool thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself
 the time will come when thou shalt wish for me
 to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad
hastings falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
 lest to thy harm thou move our patience
queen margaret foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
rivers were you well served you would be taught your duty
queen margaret to serve me well you all should do me duty
 teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
 o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dorset dispute not with her she is lunatic
queen margaret peace master marquess you are malapert
 your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
 o that your young nobility could judge
 what twere to lose it and be miserable
 they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
 and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
gloucester good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess
dorset it toucheth you my lord as much as me
gloucester yea and much more but i was born so high
 our aery buildeth in the cedar's top
 and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
queen margaret and turns the sun to shade alas alas
 witness my son now in the shade of death
 whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
 hath in eternal darkness folded up
 your aery buildeth in our aery's nest
 o god that seest it do not suffer it
 as it was won with blood lost be it so
buckingham have done for shame if not for charity
queen margaret urge neither charity nor shame to me
 uncharitably with me have you dealt
 and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd
 my charity is outrage life my shame
 and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage
buckingham have done have done
queen margaret o princely buckingham i'll kiss thy hand
 in sign of league and amity with thee
 now fair befal thee and thy noble house
 thy garments are not spotted with our blood
 nor thou within the compass of my curse
buckingham nor no one here for curses never pass
 the lips of those that breathe them in the air
queen margaret i'll not believe but they ascend the sky
 and there awake god's gentlesleeping peace
 o buckingham take heed of yonder dog
 look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
 his venom tooth will rankle to the death
 have not to do with him beware of him
 sin death and hell have set their marks on him
 and all their ministers attend on him
gloucester what doth she say my lord of buckingham
buckingham nothing that i respect my gracious lord
queen margaret what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
 and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
 o but remember this another day
 when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
 and say poor margaret was a prophetess
 live each of you the subjects to his hate
 and he to yours and all of you to god's
 exit
hastings my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses
rivers and so doth mine i muse why she's at liberty
gloucester i cannot blame her by god's holy mother
 she hath had too much wrong and i repent
 my part thereof that i have done to her
queen elizabeth i never did her any to my knowledge
gloucester but you have all the vantage of her wrong
 i was too hot to do somebody good
 that is too cold in thinking of it now
 marry as for clarence he is well repaid
 he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
 god pardon them that are the cause of it
rivers a virtuous and a christianlike conclusion
 to pray for them that have done scathe to us
gloucester so do i ever
 aside
 being welladvised
 for had i cursed now i had cursed myself
 enter catesby
catesby madam his majesty doth call for you
 and for your grace and you my noble lords
queen elizabeth catesby we come lords will you go with us
rivers madam we will attend your grace
 exeunt all but gloucester
gloucester i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
 the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
 i lay unto the grievous charge of others
 clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness
 i do beweep to many simple gulls
 namely to hastings derby buckingham
 and say it is the queen and her allies
 that stir the king against the duke my brother
 now they believe it and withal whet me
 to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey
 but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture
 tell them that god bids us do good for evil
 and thus i clothe my naked villany
 with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ
 and seem a saint when most i play the devil
 enter two murderers
 but soft here come my executioners
 how now my hardy stout resolved mates
 are you now going to dispatch this deed
first murderer we are my lord and come to have the warrant
 that we may be admitted where he is
gloucester well thought upon i have it here about me
 gives the warrant
 when you have done repair to crosby place
 but sirs be sudden in the execution
 withal obdurate do not hear him plead
 for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
 may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
first murderer tush
 fear not my lord we will not stand to prate
 talkers are no good doers be assured
 we come to use our hands and not our tongues
gloucester your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears
 i like you lads about your business straight

act i
scene iv london the tower
 enter clarence and brakenbury
brakenbury why looks your grace so heavily today
clarence o i have pass'd a miserable night
 so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams
 that as i am a christian faithful man
 i would not spend another such a night
 though twere to buy a world of happy days
 so full of dismal terror was the time
brakenbury what was your dream i long to hear you tell it
clarence methoughts that i had broken from the tower
 and was embark'd to cross to burgundy
 and in my company my brother gloucester
 who from my cabin tempted me to walk
 upon the hatches thence we looked toward england
 and cited up a thousand fearful times
 during the wars of york and lancaster
 that had befall'n us as we paced along
 upon the giddy footing of the hatches
 methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling
 struck me that thought to stay him overboard
 into the tumbling billows of the main
 lord lord methought what pain it was to drown
 what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears
 what ugly sights of death within mine eyes
 methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
 ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon
 wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
 inestimable stones unvalued jewels
 all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea
 some lay in dead men's skulls and in those holes
 where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
 as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
 which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
 and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by
brakenbury had you such leisure in the time of death
 to gaze upon the secrets of the deep
clarence methought i had and often did i strive
 to yield the ghost but still the envious flood
 kept in my soul and would not let it forth
 to seek the empty vast and wandering air
 but smother'd it within my panting bulk
 which almost burst to belch it in the sea
brakenbury awaked you not with this sore agony
clarence o no my dream was lengthen'd after life
 o then began the tempest to my soul
 who pass'd methought the melancholy flood
 with that grim ferryman which poets write of
 unto the kingdom of perpetual night
 the first that there did greet my stranger soul
 was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick
 who cried aloud what scourge for perjury
 can this dark monarchy afford false clarence'
 and so he vanish'd then came wandering by
 a shadow like an angel with bright hair
 dabbled in blood and he squeak'd out aloud
 clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence
 that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury
 seize on him furies take him to your torments'
 with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
 environ'd me about and howled in mine ears
 such hideous cries that with the very noise
 i trembling waked and for a season after
 could not believe but that i was in hell
 such terrible impression made the dream
brakenbury no marvel my lord though it affrighted you
 i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it
clarence o brakenbury i have done those things
 which now bear evidence against my soul
 for edward's sake and see how he requites me
 o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
 but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds
 yet execute thy wrath in me alone
 o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
 i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me
 my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
brakenbury i will my lord god give your grace good rest
 clarence sleeps
 sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
 makes the night morning and the noontide night
 princes have but their tides for their glories
 an outward honour for an inward toil
 and for unfelt imagination
 they often feel a world of restless cares
 so that betwixt their tides and low names
 there's nothing differs but the outward fame
 enter the two murderers
first murderer ho who's here
brakenbury in god's name what are you and how came you hither
first murderer i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs
brakenbury yea are you so brief
second murderer o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show
 him our commission talk no more
 brakenbury reads it
brakenbury i am in this commanded to deliver
 the noble duke of clarence to your hands
 i will not reason what is meant hereby
 because i will be guiltless of the meaning
 here are the keys there sits the duke asleep
 i'll to the king and signify to him
 that thus i have resign'd my charge to you
first murderer do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well
 exit brakenbury
second murderer what shall we stab him as he sleeps
first murderer no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes
second murderer when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till
 the judgmentday
first murderer why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping
second murderer the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind
 of remorse in me
first murderer what art thou afraid
second murderer not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be
 damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us
first murderer i thought thou hadst been resolute
second murderer so i am to let him live
first murderer back to the duke of gloucester tell him so
second murderer i pray thee stay a while i hope my holy humour
 will change twas wont to hold me but while one
 would tell twenty
first murderer how dost thou feel thyself now
second murderer faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet
 within me
first murderer remember our reward when the deed is done
second murderer zounds he dies i had forgot the reward
first murderer where is thy conscience now
second murderer in the duke of gloucester's purse
first murderer so when he opens his purse to give us our reward
 thy conscience flies out
second murderer let it go there's few or none will entertain it
first murderer how if it come to thee again
second murderer i'll not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it
 makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it
 accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him
 he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it
 detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
 mutinies in a man's bosom it fills one full of
 obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
 that i found it beggars any man that keeps it it
 is turned out of all towns and cities for a
 dangerous thing and every man that means to live
 well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
 without it
first murderer zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me
 not to kill the duke
second murderer take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he
 would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh
first murderer tut i am strongframed he cannot prevail with me
 i warrant thee
second murderer spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
 reputation come shall we to this gear
first murderer take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
 sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt
 in the next room
second murderer o excellent devise make a sop of him
first murderer hark he stirs shall i strike
second murderer no first let's reason with him
clarence where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine
second murderer you shall have wine enough my lord anon
clarence in god's name what art thou
second murderer a man as you are
clarence but not as i am royal
second murderer nor you as we are loyal
clarence thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
second murderer my voice is now the king's my looks mine own
clarence how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
 your eyes do menace me why look you pale
 who sent you hither wherefore do you come
both to to to
clarence to murder me
both ay ay
clarence you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
 and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
 wherein my friends have i offended you
first murderer offended us you have not but the king
clarence i shall be reconciled to him again
second murderer never my lord therefore prepare to die
clarence are you call'd forth from out a world of men
 to slay the innocent what is my offence
 where are the evidence that do accuse me
 what lawful quest have given their verdict up
 unto the frowning judge or who pronounced
 the bitter sentence of poor clarence death
 before i be convict by course of law
 to threaten me with death is most unlawful
 i charge you as you hope to have redemption
 by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins
 that you depart and lay no hands on me
 the deed you undertake is damnable
first murderer what we will do we do upon command
second murderer and he that hath commanded is the king
clarence erroneous vassal the great king of kings
 hath in the tables of his law commanded
 that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then
 spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's
 take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands
 to hurl upon their heads that break his law
second murderer and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
 for false forswearing and for murder too
 thou didst receive the holy sacrament
 to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
first murderer and like a traitor to the name of god
 didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
 unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son
second murderer whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend
first murderer how canst thou urge god's dreadful law to us
 when thou hast broke it in so dear degree
clarence alas for whose sake did i that ill deed
 for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs
 he sends ye not to murder me for this
 for in this sin he is as deep as i
 if god will be revenged for this deed
 o know you yet he doth it publicly
 take not the quarrel from his powerful arm
 he needs no indirect nor lawless course
 to cut off those that have offended him
first murderer who made thee then a bloody minister
 when gallantspringing brave plantagenet
 that princely novice was struck dead by thee
clarence my brother's love the devil and my rage
first murderer thy brother's love our duty and thy fault
 provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence oh if you love my brother hate not me
 i am his brother and i love him well
 if you be hired for meed go back again
 and i will send you to my brother gloucester
 who shall reward you better for my life
 than edward will for tidings of my death
second murderer you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you
clarence o no he loves me and he holds me dear
 go you to him from me
both ay so we will
clarence tell him when that our princely father york
 bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
 and charged us from his soul to love each other
 he little thought of this divided friendship
 bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
first murderer ay millstones as be lesson'd us to weep
clarence o do not slander him for he is kind
first murderer right
 as snow in harvest thou deceivest thyself
 tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence it cannot be for when i parted with him
 he hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs
 that he would labour my delivery
second murderer why so he doth now he delivers thee
 from this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven
first murderer make peace with god for you must die my lord
clarence hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
 to counsel me to make my peace with god
 and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind
 that thou wilt war with god by murdering me
 ah sirs consider he that set you on
 to do this deed will hate you for the deed
second murderer what shall we do
clarence relent and save your souls
first murderer relent tis cowardly and womanish
clarence not to relent is beastly savage devilish
 which of you if you were a prince's son
 being pent from liberty as i am now
 if two such murderers as yourselves came to you
 would not entreat for life
 my friend i spy some pity in thy looks
 o if thine eye be not a flatterer
 come thou on my side and entreat for me
 as you would beg were you in my distress
 a begging prince what beggar pities not
second murderer look behind you my lord
first murderer take that and that if all this will not do
 stabs him
 i'll drown you in the malmseybutt within
 exit with the body
second murderer a bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd
 how fain like pilate would i wash my hands
 of this most grievous guilty murder done
 reenter first murderer
first murderer how now what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not
 by heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art
second murderer i would he knew that i had saved his brother
 take thou the fee and tell him what i say
 for i repent me that the duke is slain
 exit
first murderer so do not i go coward as thou art
 now must i hide his body in some hole
 until the duke take order for his burial
 and when i have my meed i must away
 for this will out and here i must not stay

 but with all duteous love

 with hate in those where i expect most love
 when i have most need to employ a friend
 and most assured that he is a friend
 deep hollow treacherous and full of guile

 when i am cold in zeal to yours
king edward iv a pleasing cordial princely buckingham
 is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
 there wanteth now our brother gloucester here
 to make the perfect period of this peace
buckingham and in good time here comes the noble duke
 enter gloucester
gloucester good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
 and princely peers a happy time of day
king edward iv happy indeed as we have spent the day
 brother we done deeds of charity
 made peace enmity fair love of hate
 between these swelling wrongincensed peers
gloucester a blessed labour my most sovereign liege
 amongst this princely heap if any here
 by false intelligence or wrong surmise
 hold me a foe
 if i unwittingly or in my rage
 have aught committed that is hardly borne
 by any in this presence i desire
 to reconcile me to his friendly peace
 tis death to me to be at enmity
 i hate it and desire all good men's love
 first madam i entreat true peace of you
 which i will purchase with my duteous service
 of you my noble cousin buckingham
 if ever any grudge were lodged between us
 of you lord rivers and lord grey of you
 that without desert have frown'd on me
 dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
 i do not know that englishman alive
 with whom my soul is any jot at odds
 more than the infant that is born tonight
 i thank my god for my humility
queen elizabeth a holy day shall this be kept hereafter
 i would to god all strifes were well compounded
 my sovereign liege i do beseech your majesty
 to take our brother clarence to your grace
gloucester why madam have i offer'd love for this
 to be so bouted in this royal presence
 who knows not that the noble duke is dead
 they all start
 you do him injury to scorn his corse
rivers who knows not he is dead who knows he is
queen elizabeth all seeing heaven what a world is this
buckingham look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
dorset ay my good lord and no one in this presence
 but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
king edward iv is clarence dead the order was reversed
gloucester but he poor soul by your first order died
 and that a winged mercury did bear
 some tardy cripple bore the countermand
 that came too lag to see him buried
 god grant that some less noble and less loyal
 nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood
 deserve not worse than wretched clarence did
 and yet go current from suspicion
 enter derby
dorset a boon my sovereign for my service done
king edward iv i pray thee peace my soul is full of sorrow
dorset i will not rise unless your highness grant
king edward iv then speak at once what is it thou demand'st
dorset the forfeit sovereign of my servant's life
 who slew today a righteous gentleman
 lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
king edward iv have a tongue to doom my brother's death
 and shall the same give pardon to a slave
 my brother slew no man his fault was thought
 and yet his punishment was cruel death
 who sued to me for him who in my rage
 kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advised
 who spake of brotherhood who spake of love
 who told me how the poor soul did forsake
 the mighty warwick and did fight for me
 who told me in the field by tewksbury
 when oxford had me down he rescued me
 and said dear brother live and be a king'
 who told me when we both lay in the field
 frozen almost to death how he did lap me
 even in his own garments and gave himself
 all thin and naked to the numb cold night
 all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
 sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you
 had so much grace to put it in my mind
 but when your carters or your waitingvassals
 have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
 the precious image of our dear redeemer
 you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
 and i unjustly too must grant it you
 but for my brother not a man would speak
 nor i ungracious speak unto myself
 for him poor soul the proudest of you all
 have been beholding to him in his life
 yet none of you would once plead for his life
 o god i fear thy justice will take hold
 on me and you and mine and yours for this
 come hastings help me to my closet
 oh poor clarence
 exeunt some with king edward iv and queen margaret
gloucester this is the fruit of rashness mark'd you not
 how that the guilty kindred of the queen
 look'd pale when they did hear of clarence death
 o they did urge it still unto the king
 god will revenge it but come let us in
 to comfort edward with our company
buckingham we wait upon your grace

act ii
scene ii the palace
 enter the duchess of york with the two children of clarence
boy tell me good grandam is our father dead
duchess of york no boy
boy why do you wring your hands and beat your breast
 and cry o clarence my unhappy son'
girl why do you look on us and shake your head
 and call us wretches orphans castaways
 if that our noble father be alive
duchess of york my pretty cousins you mistake me much
 i do lament the sickness of the king
 as loath to lose him not your father's death
 it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost
boy then grandam you conclude that he is dead
 the king my uncle is to blame for this
 god will revenge it whom i will importune
 with daily prayers all to that effect
girl and so will i
duchess of york peace children peace the king doth love you well
 incapable and shallow innocents
 you cannot guess who caused your father's death
boy grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester
 told me the king provoked by the queen
 devised impeachments to imprison him 
 and when my uncle told me so he wept
 and hugg'd me in his arm and kindly kiss'd my cheek
 bade me rely on him as on my father
 and he would love me dearly as his child
duchess of york oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes
 and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile
 he is my son yea and therein my shame
 yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
boy think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
duchess of york ay boy
boy i cannot think it hark what noise is this
 enter queen elizabeth with her hair about her
 ears rivers and dorset after her
queen elizabeth oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
 to chide my fortune and torment myself
 i'll join with black despair against my soul
 and to myself become an enemy
duchess of york what means this scene of rude impatience
queen elizabeth to make an act of tragic violence
 edward my lord your son our king is dead
 why grow the branches now the root is wither'd
 why wither not the leaves the sap being gone
 if you will live lament if die be brief
 that our swiftwinged souls may catch the king's
 or like obedient subjects follow him
 to his new kingdom of perpetual rest
duchess of york ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow
 as i had title in thy noble husband
 i have bewept a worthy husband's death
 and lived by looking on his images
 but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
 are crack'd in pieces by malignant death
 and i for comfort have but one false glass
 which grieves me when i see my shame in him
 thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
 and hast the comfort of thy children left thee
 but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
 and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs
 edward and clarence o what cause have i
 thine being but a moiety of my grief
 to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries
boy good aunt you wept not for our father's death
 how can we aid you with our kindred tears
girl our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd
 your widowdolour likewise be unwept
queen elizabeth give me no help in lamentation
 i am not barren to bring forth complaints
 all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
 that i being govern'd by the watery moon
 may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
 oh for my husband for my dear lord edward
children oh for our father for our dear lord clarence
duchess of york alas for both both mine edward and clarence
queen elizabeth what stay had i but edward and he's gone
children what stay had we but clarence and he's gone
duchess of york what stays had i but they and they are gone
queen elizabeth was never widow had so dear a loss
children were never orphans had so dear a loss
duchess of york was never mother had so dear a loss
 alas i am the mother of these moans
 their woes are parcell'd mine are general
 she for an edward weeps and so do i
 i for a clarence weep so doth not she
 these babes for clarence weep and so do i
 i for an edward weep so do not they
 alas you three on me threefold distress'd
 pour all your tears i am your sorrow's nurse
 and i will pamper it with lamentations
dorset comfort dear mother god is much displeased
 that you take with unthankfulness his doing
 in common worldly things tis call'd ungrateful
 with dull unwilligness to repay a debt
 which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
 much more to be thus opposite with heaven
 for it requires the royal debt it lent you
rivers madam bethink you like a careful mother
 of the young prince your son send straight for him
 let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives
 drown desperate sorrow in dead edward's grave
 and plant your joys in living edward's throne
 enter gloucester buckingham derby hastings and ratcliff
gloucester madam have comfort all of us have cause
 to wail the dimming of our shining star
 but none can cure their harms by wailing them
 madam my mother i do cry you mercy
 i did not see your grace humbly on my knee
 i crave your blessing
duchess of york god bless thee and put meekness in thy mind
 love charity obedience and true duty
gloucester aside amen and make me die a good old man
 that is the buttend of a mother's blessing
 i marvel why her grace did leave it out
buckingham you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers
 that bear this mutual heavy load of moan
 now cheer each other in each other's love
 though we have spent our harvest of this king
 we are to reap the harvest of his son
 the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
 but lately splinter'd knit and join'd together
 must gently be preserved cherish'd and kept
 me seemeth good that with some little train
 forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
 hither to london to be crown'd our king
rivers why with some little train my lord of buckingham
buckingham marry my lord lest by a multitude
 the newheal'd wound of malice should break out
 which would be so much the more dangerous
 by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd
 where every horse bears his commanding rein
 and may direct his course as please himself
 as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
 in my opinion ought to be prevented
gloucester i hope the king made peace with all of us
 and the compact is firm and true in me
rivers and so in me and so i think in all
 yet since it is but green it should be put
 to no apparent likelihood of breach
 which haply by much company might be urged
 therefore i say with noble buckingham
 that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
hastings and so say i
gloucester then be it so and go we to determine
 who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
 madam and you my mother will you go
 to give your censures in this weighty business
queen elizabeth 
 with all our harts
duchess of york 
 exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester
buckingham my lord whoever journeys to the prince
 for god's sake let not us two be behind
 for by the way i'll sort occasion
 as index to the story we late talk'd of
 to part the queen's proud kindred from the king
gloucester my other self my counsel's consistory
 my oracle my prophet my dear cousin
 i like a child will go by thy direction
 towards ludlow then for we'll not stay behind

first citizen ay that the king is dead
second citizen bad news by'r lady seldom comes the better
 i fear i fear twill prove a troublous world
 enter another citizen
third citizen neighbours god speed
first citizen give you good morrow sir
third citizen doth this news hold of good king edward's death
second citizen ay sir it is too true god help the while
third citizen then masters look to see a troublous world
first citizen no no by god's good grace his son shall reign
third citizen woe to the land that's govern'd by a child
second citizen in him there is a hope of government
 that in his nonage council under him
 and in his full and ripen'd years himself
 no doubt shall then and till then govern well
first citizen so stood the state when henry the sixth
 was crown'd in paris but at nine months old
third citizen stood the state so no no good friends god wot
 for then this land was famously enrich'd
 with politic grave counsel then the king
 had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
first citizen why so hath this both by the father and mother
third citizen better it were they all came by the father
 or by the father there were none at all
 for emulation now who shall be nearest
 will touch us all too near if god prevent not
 o full of danger is the duke of gloucester
 and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud
 and were they to be ruled and not to rule
 this sickly land might solace as before
first citizen come come we fear the worst all shall be well
third citizen when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks
 when great leaves fall the winter is at hand
 when the sun sets who doth not look for night
 untimely storms make men expect a dearth
 all may be well but if god sort it so
 tis more than we deserve or i expect
second citizen truly the souls of men are full of dread
 ye cannot reason almost with a man
 that looks not heavily and full of fear
third citizen before the times of change still is it so
 by a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
 ensuing dangers as by proof we see
 the waters swell before a boisterous storm
 but leave it all to god whither away
second citizen marry we were sent for to the justices
third citizen and so was i i'll bear you company

 my uncle rivers talk'd how i did grow
 more than my brother ay quoth my uncle
 gloucester
 small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace'
 and since methinks i would not grow so fast
 because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
duchess of york good faith good faith the saying did not hold
 in him that did object the same to thee
 he was the wretched'st thing when he was young
 so long agrowing and so leisurely
 that if this rule were true he should be gracious
archbishop of york why madam so no doubt he is
duchess of york i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
york now by my troth if i had been remember'd
 i could have given my uncle's grace a flout
 to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine
duchess of york how my pretty york i pray thee let me hear it
york marry they say my uncle grew so fast
 that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
 twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
 grandam this would have been a biting jest
duchess of york i pray thee pretty york who told thee this
york grandam his nurse
duchess of york his nurse why she was dead ere thou wert born

 how many of you have mine eyes beheld
 my husband lost his life to get the crown
 and often up and down my sons were toss'd
 for me to joy and weep their gain and loss
 and being seated and domestic broils
 clean overblown themselves the conquerors
 make war upon themselves blood against blood
 self against self o preposterous
 and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
 or let me die to look on death no more
queen elizabeth come come my boy we will to sanctuary

gloucester sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years

 god keep you from them and from such false friends
prince edward god keep me from false friends but they were none
gloucester my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you

lord mayor god bless your grace with health and happy days
prince edward i thank you good my lord and thank you all
 i thought my mother and my brother york
 would long ere this have met us on the way
 fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not
 to tell us whether they will come or no
 enter hastings
buckingham and in good time here comes the sweating lord
prince edward welcome my lord what will our mother come
hastings on what occasion god he knows not i
 the queen your mother and your brother york
 have taken sanctuary the tender prince
 would fain have come with me to meet your grace
 but by his mother was perforce withheld
buckingham fie what an indirect and peevish course
 is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace
 persuade the queen to send the duke of york
 unto his princely brother presently
 if she deny lord hastings go with him
 and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
cardinal my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory
 can from his mother win the duke of york
 anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
 to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid
 we should infringe the holy privilege
 of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
 would i be guilty of so deep a sin
buckingham you are too senselessobstinate my lord
 too ceremonious and traditional
 weigh it but with the grossness of this age
 you break not sanctuary in seizing him
 the benefit thereof is always granted
 to those whose dealings have deserved the place
 and those who have the wit to claim the place
 this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it
 and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
 then taking him from thence that is not there
 you break no privilege nor charter there
 oft have i heard of sanctuary men
 but sanctuary children ne'er till now
cardinal my lord you shall o'errule my mind for once
 come on lord hastings will you go with me
hastings i go my lord
prince edward good lords make all the speedy haste you may
 exeunt cardinal and hastings
 say uncle gloucester if our brother come
 where shall we sojourn till our coronation
gloucester where it seems best unto your royal self
 if i may counsel you some day or two
 your highness shall repose you at the tower
 then where you please and shall be thought most fit
 for your best health and recreation
prince edward i do not like the tower of any place
 did julius caesar build that place my lord
buckingham he did my gracious lord begin that place
 which since succeeding ages have reedified
prince edward is it upon record or else reported
 successively from age to age he built it
buckingham upon record my gracious lord
prince edward but say my lord it were not register'd
 methinks the truth should live from age to age
 as twere retail'd to all posterity
 even to the general allending day
gloucester aside so wise so young they say do never
 live long
prince edward what say you uncle
gloucester i say without characters fame lives long
 aside
 thus like the formal vice iniquity
 i moralize two meanings in one word
prince edward that julius caesar was a famous man
 with what his valour did enrich his wit
 his wit set down to make his valour live
 death makes no conquest of this conqueror
 for now he lives in fame though not in life
 i'll tell you what my cousin buckingham
buckingham what my gracious lord
prince edward an if i live until i be a man
 i'll win our ancient right in france again
 or die a soldier as i lived a king
gloucester aside short summers lightly have a forward spring
 enter young york hastings and the cardinal
buckingham now in good time here comes the duke of york
prince edward richard of york how fares our loving brother
york well my dread lord so must i call you now
prince edward ay brother to our grief as it is yours
 too late he died that might have kept that title
 which by his death hath lost much majesty
gloucester how fares our cousin noble lord of york
york i thank you gentle uncle o my lord
 you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
 the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
gloucester he hath my lord
york and therefore is he idle
gloucester o my fair cousin i must not say so
york then is he more beholding to you than i
gloucester he may command me as my sovereign
 but you have power in me as in a kinsman
york i pray you uncle give me this dagger
gloucester my dagger little cousin with all my heart
prince edward a beggar brother
york of my kind uncle that i know will give
 and being but a toy which is no grief to give
gloucester a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin
york a greater gift o that's the sword to it
gloucester a gentle cousin were it light enough
york o then i see you will part but with light gifts
 in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay
gloucester it is too heavy for your grace to wear
york i weigh it lightly were it heavier
gloucester what would you have my weapon little lord
york i would that i might thank you as you call me
gloucester how
york little
prince edward my lord of york will still be cross in talk
 uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
york you mean to bear me not to bear with me
 uncle my brother mocks both you and me
 because that i am little like an ape
 he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
buckingham with what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
 to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
 he prettily and aptly taunts himself
 so cunning and so young is wonderful
gloucester my lord will't please you pass along
 myself and my good cousin buckingham
 will to your mother to entreat of her
 to meet you at the tower and welcome you
york what will you go unto the tower my lord
prince edward my lord protector needs will have it so
york i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
gloucester why what should you fear
york marry my uncle clarence angry ghost
 my grandam told me he was murdered there
prince edward i fear no uncles dead
gloucester nor none that live i hope
prince edward an if they live i hope i need not fear
 but come my lord and with a heavy heart
 thinking on them go i unto the tower
 a sennet exeunt all but gloucester buckingham
 and catesby
buckingham think you my lord this little prating york
 was not incensed by his subtle mother
 to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
gloucester no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy
 bold quick ingenious forward capable
 he is all the mother's from the top to toe
buckingham well let them rest come hither catesby
 thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
 as closely to conceal what we impart
 thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way
 what think'st thou is it not an easy matter
 to make william lord hastings of our mind
 for the instalment of this noble duke
 in the seat royal of this famous isle
catesby he for his father's sake so loves the prince
 that he will not be won to aught against him
buckingham what think'st thou then of stanley what will he
catesby he will do all in all as hastings doth
buckingham well then no more but this go gentle catesby
 and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings
 how doth he stand affected to our purpose
 and summon him tomorrow to the tower
 to sit about the coronation
 if thou dost find him tractable to us
 encourage him and show him all our reasons
 if he be leaden icycold unwilling
 be thou so too and so break off your talk
 and give us notice of his inclination
 for we tomorrow hold divided councils
 wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd
gloucester commend me to lord william tell him catesby
 his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
 tomorrow are let blood at pomfretcastle
 and bid my friend for joy of this good news
 give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
buckingham good catesby go effect this business soundly
catesby my good lords both with all the heed i may
gloucester shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep
catesby you shall my lord
gloucester at crosby place there shall you find us both
 exit catesby
buckingham now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
 lord hastings will not yield to our complots
gloucester chop off his head man somewhat we will do
 and look when i am king claim thou of me
 the earldom of hereford and the moveables
 whereof the king my brother stood possess'd
buckingham i'll claim that promise at your grace's hands
gloucester and look to have it yielded with all willingness
 come let us sup betimes that afterwards
 we may digest our complots in some form

scene ii before lord hastings house
 enter a messenger
messenger what ho my lord
hastings within who knocks at the door
messenger a messenger from the lord stanley
 enter hastings
hastings what is't o'clock
messenger upon the stroke of four
hastings cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights
messenger so it should seem by that i have to say
 first he commends him to your noble lordship
hastings and then
messenger and then he sends you word
 he dreamt tonight the boar had razed his helm
 besides he says there are two councils held
 and that may be determined at the one
 which may make you and him to rue at the other
 therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure
 if presently you will take horse with him
 and with all speed post with him toward the north
 to shun the danger that his soul divines
hastings go fellow go return unto thy lord
 bid him not fear the separated councils
 his honour and myself are at the one
 and at the other is my servant catesby
 where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
 whereof i shall not have intelligence
 tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance
 and for his dreams i wonder he is so fond
 to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
 to fly the boar before the boar pursues
 were to incense the boar to follow us
 and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
 go bid thy master rise and come to me
 and we will both together to the tower
 where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
messenger my gracious lord i'll tell him what you say
 exit
 enter catesby
catesby many good morrows to my noble lord
hastings good morrow catesby you are early stirring
 what news what news in this our tottering state
catesby it is a reeling world indeed my lord
 and i believe twill never stand upright
 tim richard wear the garland of the realm
hastings how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown
catesby ay my good lord
hastings i'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
 ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced
 but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
catesby ay on my life and hopes to find forward
 upon his party for the gain thereof
 and thereupon he sends you this good news
 that this same very day your enemies
 the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret
hastings indeed i am no mourner for that news
 because they have been still mine enemies
 but that i'll give my voice on richard's side
 to bar my master's heirs in true descent
 god knows i will not do it to the death
catesby god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
hastings but i shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence
 that they who brought me in my master's hate
 i live to look upon their tragedy
 i tell thee catesby
catesby what my lord
hastings ere a fortnight make me elder
 i'll send some packing that yet think not on it
catesby tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
 when men are unprepared and look not for it
hastings o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
 with rivers vaughan grey and so twill do
 with some men else who think themselves as safe
 as thou and i who as thou know'st are dear
 to princely richard and to buckingham
catesby the princes both make high account of you
 aside
 for they account his head upon the bridge
hastings i know they do and i have well deserved it
 enter stanley

stanley my lord good morrow good morrow catesby

 and never in my life i do protest
 was it more precious to me than tis now
 think you but that i know our state secure
 i would be so triumphant as i am
stanley the lords at pomfret when they rode from london
 were jocund and supposed their state was sure
 and they indeed had no cause to mistrust
 but yet you see how soon the day o'ercast
 this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt
 pray god i say i prove a needless coward
 what shall we toward the tower the day is spent
hastings come come have with you wot you what my lord
 today the lords you talk of are beheaded
lord stanley they for their truth might better wear their heads
 than some that have accused them wear their hats
 but come my lord let us away

hastings go on before i'll talk with this good fellow
 exeunt stanley and catesby
 how now sirrah how goes the world with thee
pursuivant the better that your lordship please to ask
hastings i tell thee man tis better with me now

 then was i going prisoner to the tower
 by the suggestion of the queen's allies
 but now i tell theekeep it to thyself

 and i in better state than e'er i was
pursuivant god hold it to your honour's good content

scene iv the tower of london
 enter buckingham derby hastings the bishop of
 ely ratcliff lovel with others and take their
 seats at a table
hastings my lords at once the cause why we are met
 is to determine of the coronation
 in god's name speak when is the royal day
buckingham are all things fitting for that royal time
derby it is and wants but nomination
bishop of ely tomorrow then i judge a happy day
buckingham who knows the lord protector's mind herein
 who is most inward with the royal duke
bishop of ely your grace we think should soonest know his mind
buckingham who i my lord i we know each other's faces
 but for our hearts he knows no more of mine
 than i of yours
 nor i no more of his than you of mine
 lord hastings you and he are near in love
hastings i thank his grace i know he loves me well
 but for his purpose in the coronation
 i have not sounded him nor he deliver'd
 his gracious pleasure any way therein
 but you my noble lords may name the time
 and in the duke's behalf i'll give my voice
 which i presume he'll take in gentle part
 enter gloucester
bishop of ely now in good time here comes the duke himself
gloucester my noble lords and cousins all good morrow
 i have been long a sleeper but i hope
 my absence doth neglect no great designs
 which by my presence might have been concluded
buckingham had not you come upon your cue my lord
 william lord hastings had pronounced your part

gloucester cousin of buckingham a word with you
 drawing him aside
 catesby hath sounded hastings in our business
 and finds the testy gentleman so hot
 as he will lose his head ere give consent
 his master's son as worshipful as he terms it
 shall lose the royalty of england's throne
buckingham withdraw you hence my lord i'll follow you
 exit gloucester buckingham following
derby we have not yet set down this day of triumph
 tomorrow in mine opinion is too sudden
 for i myself am not so well provided
 as else i would be were the day prolong'd
 reenter bishop of ely
bishop of ely where is my lord protector i have sent for these
 strawberries
hastings his grace looks cheerfully and smooth today
 there's some conceit or other likes him well
 when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit
 i think there's never a man in christendom
 that can less hide his love or hate than he
 for by his face straight shall you know his heart
derby what of his heart perceive you in his face
 by any likelihood he show'd today
hastings marry that with no man here he is offended
 for were he he had shown it in his looks
derby i pray god he be not i say
 reenter gloucester and buckingham
gloucester i pray you all tell me what they deserve
 that do conspire my death with devilish plots
 of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd
 upon my body with their hellish charms
hastings the tender love i bear your grace my lord
 makes me most forward in this noble presence
 to doom the offenders whatsoever they be
 i say my lord they have deserved death
gloucester then be your eyes the witness of this ill
 see how i am bewitch'd behold mine arm
 is like a blasted sapling wither'd up
 and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch
 consorted with that harlot strumpet shore
 that by their witchcraft thus have marked me
hastings if they have done this thing my gracious lord
gloucester if i thou protector of this damned strumpet
 tellest thou me of ifs thou art a traitor
 off with his head now by saint paul i swear
 i will not dine until i see the same
 lovel and ratcliff look that it be done
 the rest that love me rise and follow me
 exeunt all but hastings ratcliff and lovel
hastings woe woe for england not a whit for me
 for i too fond might have prevented this
 stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
 but i disdain'd it and did scorn to fly
 three times today my footcloth horse did stumble
 and startled when he look'd upon the tower
 as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
 o now i want the priest that spake to me
 i now repent i told the pursuivant
 as twere triumphing at mine enemies
 how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd
 and i myself secure in grace and favour
 o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse
 is lighted on poor hastings wretched head
ratcliff dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner
 make a short shrift he longs to see your head
hastings o momentary grace of mortal men
 which we more hunt for than the grace of god
 who builds his hopes in air of your good looks
 lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
 ready with every nod to tumble down
 into the fatal bowels of the deep
lovel come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim
hastings o bloody richard miserable england
 i prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
 that ever wretched age hath look'd upon
 come lead me to the block bear him my head
 they smile at me that shortly shall be dead

scene v the towerwalls
 enter gloucester and buckingham in rotten armour
 marvellous illfavoured
gloucester come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour
 murder thy breath in the middle of a word
 and then begin again and stop again
 as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror
buckingham tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian
 speak and look back and pry on every side
 tremble and start at wagging of a straw
 intending deep suspicion ghastly looks
 are at my service like enforced smiles
 and both are ready in their offices
 at any time to grace my stratagems
 but what is catesby gone
gloucester he is and see he brings the mayor along
 enter the lord mayor and catesby
buckingham lord mayor
gloucester look to the drawbridge there
buckingham hark a drum
gloucester catesby o'erlook the walls
buckingham lord mayor the reason we have sent
gloucester look back defend thee here are enemies
buckingham god and our innocency defend and guard us
gloucester be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel
 enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings head
lovel here is the head of that ignoble traitor
 the dangerous and unsuspected hastings
gloucester so dear i loved the man that i must weep
 i took him for the plainest harmless creature
 that breathed upon this earth a christian
 made him my book wherein my soul recorded
 the history of all her secret thoughts
 so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
 that his apparent open guilt omitted
 i mean his conversation with shore's wife
 he lived from all attainder of suspect
buckingham well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
 that ever lived
 would you imagine or almost believe
 were't not that by great preservation
 we live to tell it you the subtle traitor
 this day had plotted in the councilhouse
 to murder me and my good lord of gloucester
lord mayor what had he so
gloucester what think you we are turks or infidels
 or that we would against the form of law
 proceed thus rashly to the villain's death
 but that the extreme peril of the case
 the peace of england and our persons safety
 enforced us to this execution
lord mayor now fair befall you he deserved his death
 and you my good lords both have well proceeded
 to warn false traitors from the like attempts
 i never look'd for better at his hands
 after he once fell in with mistress shore
gloucester yet had not we determined he should die
 until your lordship came to see his death
 which now the loving haste of these our friends
 somewhat against our meaning have prevented
 because my lord we would have had you heard
 the traitor speak and timorously confess
 the manner and the purpose of his treason
 that you might well have signified the same
 unto the citizens who haply may
 misconstrue us in him and wail his death
lord mayor but my good lord your grace's word shall serve
 as well as i had seen and heard him speak
 and doubt you not right noble princes both
 but i'll acquaint our duteous citizens
 with all your just proceedings in this cause
gloucester and to that end we wish'd your lordship here
 to avoid the carping censures of the world
buckingham but since you come too late of our intents
 yet witness what you hear we did intend
 and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
 exit lord mayor
gloucester go after after cousin buckingham
 the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post
 there at your meet'st advantage of the time
 infer the bastardy of edward's children
 tell them how edward put to death a citizen
 only for saying he would make his son
 heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
 which by the sign thereof was termed so
 moreover urge his hateful luxury
 and bestial appetite in change of lust
 which stretched to their servants daughters wives
 even where his lustful eye or savage heart
 without control listed to make his prey
 nay for a need thus far come near my person
 tell them when that my mother went with child
 of that unsatiate edward noble york
 my princely father then had wars in france
 and by just computation of the time
 found that the issue was not his begot
 which well appeared in his lineaments
 being nothing like the noble duke my father
 but touch this sparingly as twere far off
 because you know my lord my mother lives
buckingham fear not my lord i'll play the orator
 as if the golden fee for which i plead
 were for myself and so my lord adieu
gloucester if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle
 where you shall find me well accompanied
 with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops
buckingham i go and towards three or four o'clock
 look for the news that the guildhall affords
 exit buckingham
gloucester go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw
 to catesby
 go thou to friar penker bid them both
 meet me within this hour at baynard's castle
 exeunt all but gloucester
 now will i in to take some privy order
 to draw the brats of clarence out of sight
 and to give notice that no manner of person
 at any time have recourse unto the princes

 enter a scrivener with a paper in his hand
scrivener this is the indictment of the good lord hastings
 which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
 that it may be this day read over in paul's
 and mark how well the sequel hangs together
 eleven hours i spent to write it over
 for yesternight by catesby was it brought me
 the precedent was full as long adoing
 and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings
 untainted unexamined free at liberty
 here's a good world the while why who's so gross
 that seeth not this palpable device
 yet who's so blind but says he sees it not
 bad is the world and all will come to nought
 when such bad dealings must be seen in thought

scene vii baynard's castle
 enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors
gloucester how now my lord what say the citizens
buckingham now by the holy mother of our lord
 the citizens are mum and speak not a word
gloucester touch'd you the bastardy of edward's children
buckingham i did with his contract with lady lucy
 and his contract by deputy in france
 the insatiate greediness of his desires
 and his enforcement of the city wives
 his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
 as being got your father then in france
 his resemblance being not like the duke
 withal i did infer your lineaments
 being the right idea of your father
 both in your form and nobleness of mind
 laid open all your victories in scotland
 your dicipline in war wisdom in peace
 your bounty virtue fair humility
 indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose
 untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse
 and when mine oratory grew to an end
 i bid them that did love their country's good
 cry god save richard england's royal king'
gloucester ah and did they so
buckingham no so god help me they spake not a word
 but like dumb statues or breathing stones
 gazed each on other and look'd deadly pale
 which when i saw i reprehended them
 and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence
 his answer was the people were not wont
 to be spoke to but by the recorder
 then he was urged to tell my tale again
 thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd'
 but nothing spake in warrant from himself
 when he had done some followers of mine own
 at the lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps
 and some ten voices cried god save king richard'
 and thus i took the vantage of those few
 thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i
 this general applause and loving shout
 argues your wisdoms and your love to richard'
 and even here brake off and came away
gloucester what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak
buckingham no by my troth my lord
gloucester will not the mayor then and his brethren come
buckingham the mayor is here at hand intend some fear
 be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
 and look you get a prayerbook in your hand
 and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord
 for on that ground i'll build a holy descant
 and be not easily won to our request
 play the maid's part still answer nay and take it
gloucester i go and if you plead as well for them
 as i can say nay to thee for myself
 no doubt well bring it to a happy issue
buckingham go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks
 exit gloucester
 enter the lord mayor and citizens
 welcome my lord i dance attendance here
 i think the duke will not be spoke withal
 enter catesby
 here comes his servant how now catesby
 what says he
catesby my lord he doth entreat your grace
 to visit him tomorrow or next day
 he is within with two right reverend fathers
 divinely bent to meditation
 and no worldly suit would he be moved
 to draw him from his holy exercise
buckingham return good catesby to thy lord again
 tell him myself the mayor and citizens
 in deep designs and matters of great moment
 no less importing than our general good
 are come to have some conference with his grace
catesby i'll tell him what you say my lord
 exit
buckingham ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward
 he is not lolling on a lewd daybed
 but on his knees at meditation
 not dallying with a brace of courtezans
 but meditating with two deep divines
 not sleeping to engross his idle body
 but praying to enrich his watchful soul
 happy were england would this gracious prince
 take on himself the sovereignty thereof
 but sure i fear we shall ne'er win him to it
lord mayor marry god forbid his grace should say us nay
buckingham i fear he will
 reenter catesby
 how now catesby what says your lord
catesby my lord
 he wonders to what end you have assembled
 such troops of citizens to speak with him
 his grace not being warn'd thereof before
 my lord he fears you mean no good to him
buckingham sorry i am my noble cousin should
 suspect me that i mean no good to him
 by heaven i come in perfect love to him
 and so once more return and tell his grace
 exit catesby
 when holy and devout religious men
 are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence
 so sweet is zealous contemplation
 enter gloucester aloft between two bishops
 catesby returns
lord mayor see where he stands between two clergymen
buckingham two props of virtue for a christian prince
 to stay him from the fall of vanity
 and see a book of prayer in his hand
 true ornaments to know a holy man
 famous plantagenet most gracious prince
 lend favourable ears to our request
 and pardon us the interruption
 of thy devotion and right christian zeal
gloucester my lord there needs no such apology
 i rather do beseech you pardon me
 who earnest in the service of my god
 neglect the visitation of my friends
 but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure
buckingham even that i hope which pleaseth god above
 and all good men of this ungovern'd isle
gloucester i do suspect i have done some offence
 that seems disgracious in the city's eyes
 and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
buckingham you have my lord would it might please your grace
 at our entreaties to amend that fault
gloucester else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
buckingham then know it is your fault that you resign
 the supreme seat the throne majestical
 the scepter'd office of your ancestors
 your state of fortune and your due of birth
 the lineal glory of your royal house
 to the corruption of a blemished stock
 whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
 which here we waken to our country's good
 this noble isle doth want her proper limbs
 her face defaced with scars of infamy
 her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
 and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
 of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion
 which to recure we heartily solicit
 your gracious self to take on you the charge
 and kingly government of this your land
 not as protector steward substitute
 or lowly factor for another's gain
 but as successively from blood to blood
 your right of birth your empery your own
 for this consorted with the citizens
 your very worshipful and loving friends
 and by their vehement instigation
 in this just suit come i to move your grace
gloucester i know not whether to depart in silence
 or bitterly to speak in your reproof
 best fitteth my degree or your condition
 if not to answer you might haply think
 tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
 to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
 which fondly you would here impose on me
 if to reprove you for this suit of yours
 so season'd with your faithful love to me
 then on the other side i cheque'd my friends
 therefore to speak and to avoid the first
 and then in speaking not to incur the last
 definitively thus i answer you
 your love deserves my thanks but my desert
 unmeritable shuns your high request
 first if all obstacles were cut away
 and that my path were even to the crown
 as my ripe revenue and due by birth
 yet so much is my poverty of spirit
 so mighty and so many my defects
 as i had rather hide me from my greatness
 being a bark to brook no mighty sea
 than in my greatness covet to be hid
 and in the vapour of my glory smother'd
 but god be thank'd there's no need of me
 and much i need to help you if need were
 the royal tree hath left us royal fruit
 which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time
 will well become the seat of majesty
 and make no doubt us happy by his reign
 on him i lay what you would lay on me
 the right and fortune of his happy stars
 which god defend that i should wring from him
buckingham my lord this argues conscience in your grace
 but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
 all circumstances well considered
 you say that edward is your brother's son
 so say we too but not by edward's wife
 for first he was contract to lady lucy
 your mother lives a witness to that vow
 and afterward by substitute betroth'd
 to bona sister to the king of france
 these both put by a poor petitioner
 a carecrazed mother of a many children
 a beautywaning and distressed widow
 even in the afternoon of her best days
 made prize and purchase of his lustful eye
 seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
 to base declension and loathed bigamy
 by her in his unlawful bed he got
 this edward whom our manners term the prince
 more bitterly could i expostulate
 save that for reverence to some alive
 i give a sparing limit to my tongue
 then good my lord take to your royal self
 this proffer'd benefit of dignity
 if non to bless us and the land withal
 yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
 from the corruption of abusing times
 unto a lineal truederived course
lord mayor do good my lord your citizens entreat you
buckingham refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love
catesby o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
gloucester alas why would you heap these cares on me
 i am unfit for state and majesty
 i do beseech you take it not amiss
 i cannot nor i will not yield to you
buckingham if you refuse itas in love and zeal
 loath to depose the child your brother's son
 as well we know your tenderness of heart
 and gentle kind effeminate remorse
 which we have noted in you to your kin
 and egally indeed to all estates
 yet whether you accept our suit or no
 your brother's son shall never reign our king
 but we will plant some other in the throne
 to the disgrace and downfall of your house
 and in this resolution here we leave you
 come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more
gloucester o do not swear my lord of buckingham
 exit buckingham with the citizens
catesby call them again my lord and accept their suit
another do good my lord lest all the land do rue it
gloucester would you enforce me to a world of care
 well call them again i am not made of stone
 but penetrable to your kind entreats
 albeit against my conscience and my soul
 reenter buckingham and the rest
 cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men
 since you will buckle fortune on my back
 to bear her burthen whether i will or no
 i must have patience to endure the load
 but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach
 attend the sequel of your imposition
 your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
 from all the impure blots and stains thereof
 for god he knows and you may partly see
 how far i am from the desire thereof
lord mayor god bless your grace we see it and will say it
gloucester in saying so you shall but say the truth
buckingham then i salute you with this kingly title
 long live richard england's royal king
lord mayor 
 amen
citizens 
buckingham tomorrow will it please you to be crown'd
gloucester even when you please since you will have it so
buckingham tomorrow then we will attend your grace
 and so most joyfully we take our leave
gloucester come let us to our holy task again
 farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends

 which issued from my other angel husband
 and that dead saint which then i weeping follow'd
 o when i say i look'd on richard's face
 this was my wish be thou quoth i  accursed
 for making me so young so old a widow
 and when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed
 and be thy wifeif any be so mad
 as miserable by the life of thee
 as thou hast made me by my dear lord's death
 lo ere i can repeat this curse again
 even in so short a space my woman's heart
 grossly grew captive to his honey words
 and proved the subject of my own soul's curse
 which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest
 for never yet one hour in his bed
 have i enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep
 but have been waked by his timorous dreams
 besides he hates me for my father warwick
 and will no doubt shortly be rid of me
queen elizabeth poor heart adieu i pity thy complaining
lady anne no more than from my soul i mourn for yours
queen elizabeth farewell thou woful welcomer of glory
lady anne adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it
duchess of york to dorset
 go thou to richmond and good fortune guide thee
 to lady anne
 go thou to richard and good angels guard thee
 to queen elizabeth
 go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee
 i to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
 eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen
 and each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen
queen elizabeth stay yet look back with me unto the tower
 pity you ancient stones those tender babes
 whom envy hath immured within your walls
 rough cradle for such little pretty ones
 rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
 for tender princes use my babies well
 so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell

buckingham my lord your promise for the earldom

 enter tyrrel
tyrrel the tyrannous and bloody deed is done
 the most arch of piteous massacre
 that ever yet this land was guilty of
 dighton and forrest whom i did suborn
 to do this ruthless piece of butchery
 although they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs
 melting with tenderness and kind compassion
 wept like two children in their deaths sad stories
 lo thus quoth dighton lay those tender babes'
 thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another
 within their innocent alabaster arms
 their lips were four red roses on a stalk
 which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other
 a book of prayers on their pillow lay
 which once quoth forrest almost changed my mind
 but o the devil'there the villain stopp'd
 whilst dighton thus told on we smothered
 the most replenished sweet work of nature
 that from the prime creation e'er she framed'
 thus both are gone with conscience and remorse
 they could not speak and so i left them both
 to bring this tidings to the bloody king
 and here he comes
 enter king richard iii
 all hail my sovereign liege
king richard iii kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news
tyrrel if to have done the thing you gave in charge

scene iv before the palace
 enter queen margaret
queen margaret so now prosperity begins to mellow
 and drop into the rotten mouth of death
 here in these confines slily have i lurk'd
 to watch the waning of mine adversaries
 a dire induction am i witness to
 and will to france hoping the consequence
 will prove as bitter black and tragical
 withdraw thee wretched margaret who comes here
 enter queen elizabeth and the duchess of york
queen elizabeth ah my young princes ah my tender babes
 my unblown flowers newappearing sweets
 if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
 and be not fix'd in doom perpetual
 hover about me with your airy wings
 and hear your mother's lamentation
queen margaret hover about her say that right for right
 hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night
duchess of york so many miseries have crazed my voice
 that my woewearied tongue is mute and dumb
 edward plantagenet why art thou dead
queen margaret plantagenet doth quit plantagenet
 edward for edward pays a dying debt
queen elizabeth wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs
 and throw them in the entrails of the wolf
 when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
queen margaret when holy harry died and my sweet son
duchess of york blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost
 woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd
 brief abstract and record of tedious days
 rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth
 sitting down
 unlawfully made drunk with innocents blood
queen elizabeth o that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
 as thou canst yield a melancholy seat
 then would i hide my bones not rest them here
 o who hath any cause to mourn but i
 sitting down by her
queen margaret if ancient sorrow be most reverend
 give mine the benefit of seniory
 and let my woes frown on the upper hand
 if sorrow can admit society
 sitting down with them
 tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine
 i had an edward till a richard kill'd him
 i had a harry till a richard kill'd him
 thou hadst an edward till a richard kill'd him
 thou hadst a richard till a richard killed him
duchess of york i had a richard too and thou didst kill him
 i had a rutland too thou holp'st to kill him
queen margaret thou hadst a clarence too and richard kill'd him
 from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
 a hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
 that dog that had his teeth before his eyes
 to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
 that foul defacer of god's handiwork
 that excellent grand tyrant of the earth
 that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
 thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
 o upright just and truedisposing god
 how do i thank thee that this carnal cur
 preys on the issue of his mother's body
 and makes her pewfellow with others moan
duchess of york o harry's wife triumph not in my woes
 god witness with me i have wept for thine
queen margaret bear with me i am hungry for revenge
 and now i cloy me with beholding it
 thy edward he is dead that stabb'd my edward
 thy other edward dead to quit my edward
 young york he is but boot because both they
 match not the high perfection of my loss
 thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my edward
 and the beholders of this tragic play
 the adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey
 untimely smother'd in their dusky graves
 richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer
 only reserved their factor to buy souls
 and send them thither but at hand at hand
 ensues his piteous and unpitied end
 earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
 to have him suddenly convey'd away
 cancel his bond of life dear god i prey
 that i may live to say the dog is dead
queen elizabeth o thou didst prophesy the time would come
 that i should wish for thee to help me curse
 that bottled spider that foul bunchback'd toad
queen margaret i call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune
 i call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen
 the presentation of but what i was
 the flattering index of a direful pageant
 one heaved ahigh to be hurl'd down below
 a mother only mock'd with two sweet babes
 a dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble
 a sign of dignity a garish flag
 to be the aim of every dangerous shot
 a queen in jest only to fill the scene
 where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
 where are thy children wherein dost thou joy
 who sues to thee and cries god save the queen'
 where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee
 where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee
 decline all this and see what now thou art
 for happy wife a most distressed widow
 for joyful mother one that wails the name
 for queen a very caitiff crown'd with care
 for one being sued to one that humbly sues
 for one that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me
 for one being fear'd of all now fearing one
 for one commanding all obey'd of none
 thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about
 and left thee but a very prey to time
 having no more but thought of what thou wert
 to torture thee the more being what thou art
 thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
 usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
 now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke
 from which even here i slip my weary neck
 and leave the burthen of it all on thee
 farewell york's wife and queen of sad mischance
 these english woes will make me smile in france
queen elizabeth o thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile
 and teach me how to curse mine enemies
queen margaret forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days
 compare dead happiness with living woe
 think that thy babes were fairer than they were
 and he that slew them fouler than he is
 bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse
 revolving this will teach thee how to curse
queen elizabeth my words are dull o quicken them with thine
queen margaret thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
 exit
duchess of york why should calamity be full of words
queen elizabeth windy attorneys to their client woes
 airy succeeders of intestate joys
 poor breathing orators of miseries
 let them have scope though what they do impart
 help not all yet do they ease the heart
duchess of york if so then be not tonguetied go with me
 and in the breath of bitter words let's smother
 my damned son which thy two sweet sons smother'd
 i hear his drum be copious in exclaims
 enter king richard iii marching with drums and trumpets
king richard iii who intercepts my expedition
duchess of york o she that might have intercepted thee
 by strangling thee in her accursed womb
 from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
queen elizabeth hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown
 where should be graven if that right were right
 the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown
 and the dire death of my two sons and brothers
 tell me thou villain slave where are my children
duchess of york thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence
 and little ned plantagenet his son
queen elizabeth where is kind hastings rivers vaughan grey
king richard iii a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
 let not the heavens hear these telltale women
 rail on the lord's enointed strike i say
 flourish alarums
 either be patient and entreat me fair
 or with the clamorous report of war
 thus will i drown your exclamations
duchess of york art thou my son
king richard iii ay i thank god my father and yourself
duchess of york then patiently hear my impatience
king richard iii madam i have a touch of your condition
 which cannot brook the accent of reproof
duchess of york o let me speak
king richard iii do then but i'll not hear
duchess of york i will be mild and gentle in my speech
king richard iii and brief good mother for i am in haste
duchess of york art thou so hasty i have stay'd for thee
 god knows in anguish pain and agony
king richard iii and came i not at last to comfort you
duchess of york no by the holy rood thou know'st it well
 thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell
 a grievous burthen was thy birth to me
 tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
 thy schooldays frightful desperate wild and furious
 thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
 thy age confirm'd proud subdued bloody
 treacherous
 more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
 what comfortable hour canst thou name
 that ever graced me in thy company
king richard iii faith none but humphrey hour that call'd
 your grace
 to breakfast once forth of my company
 if i be so disgracious in your sight
 let me march on and not offend your grace
 strike the drum
duchess of york i prithee hear me speak
king richard iii you speak too bitterly
duchess of york hear me a word
 for i shall never speak to thee again
king richard iii so
duchess of york either thou wilt die by god's just ordinance
 ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
 or i with grief and extreme age shall perish
 and never look upon thy face again
 therefore take with thee my most heavy curse
 which in the day of battle tire thee more
 than all the complete armour that thou wear'st
 my prayers on the adverse party fight
 and there the little souls of edward's children
 whisper the spirits of thine enemies
 and promise them success and victory
 bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
 shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
 exit
queen elizabeth though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
 abides in me i say amen to all
king richard iii stay madam i must speak a word with you
queen elizabeth i have no more sons of the royal blood
 for thee to murder for my daughters richard
 they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
 and therefore level not to hit their lives
king richard iii you have a daughter call'd elizabeth
 virtuous and fair royal and gracious
queen elizabeth and must she die for this o let her live
 and i'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty
 slander myself as false to edward's bed
 throw over her the veil of infamy
 so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter
 i will confess she was not edward's daughter
king richard iii wrong not her birth she is of royal blood
queen elizabeth to save her life i'll say she is not so
king richard iii her life is only safest in her birth
queen elizabeth and only in that safety died her brothers
king richard iii lo at their births good stars were opposite
queen elizabeth no to their lives bad friends were contrary
king richard iii all unavoided is the doom of destiny
queen elizabeth true when avoided grace makes destiny
 my babes were destined to a fairer death
 if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life
king richard iii you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
queen elizabeth cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen'd
 of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
 whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts
 thy head all indirectly gave direction
 no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
 till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
 to revel in the entrails of my lambs
 but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
 my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
 till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes
 and i in such a desperate bay of death
 like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
 rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
king richard iii madam so thrive i in my enterprise
 and dangerous success of bloody wars
 as i intend more good to you and yours
 than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd
queen elizabeth what good is cover'd with the face of heaven
 to be discover'd that can do me good
king richard iii the advancement of your children gentle lady
queen elizabeth up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
king richard iii no to the dignity and height of honour
 the high imperial type of this earth's glory
queen elizabeth flatter my sorrows with report of it
 tell me what state what dignity what honour
 canst thou demise to any child of mine
king richard iii even all i have yea and myself and all
 will i withal endow a child of thine
 so in the lethe of thy angry soul
 thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
 which thou supposest i have done to thee
queen elizabeth be brief lest that be process of thy kindness
 last longer telling than thy kindness date
king richard iii then know that from my soul i love thy daughter
queen elizabeth my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul
king richard iii what do you think
queen elizabeth that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
 so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers
 and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it
king richard iii be not so hasty to confound my meaning
 i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter
 and mean to make her queen of england
queen elizabeth say then who dost thou mean shall be her king
king richard iii even he that makes her queen who should be else
queen elizabeth what thou
king richard iii i even i what think you of it madam
queen elizabeth how canst thou woo her
king richard iii that would i learn of you
 as one that are best acquainted with her humour
queen elizabeth and wilt thou learn of me
king richard iii madam with all my heart
queen elizabeth send to her by the man that slew her brothers
 a pair of bleedinghearts thereon engrave
 edward and york then haply she will weep
 therefore present to heras sometime margaret
 did to thy father steep'd in rutland's blood
 a handkerchief which say to her did drain
 the purple sap from her sweet brother's body
 and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith
 if this inducement force her not to love
 send her a story of thy noble acts
 tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence
 her uncle rivers yea and for her sake
 madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
king richard iii come come you mock me this is not the way
 to win our daughter
queen elizabeth there is no other way
 unless thou couldst put on some other shape
 and not be richard that hath done all this
king richard iii say that i did all this for love of her
queen elizabeth nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
 having bought love with such a bloody spoil
king richard iii look what is done cannot be now amended
 men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
 which after hours give leisure to repent
 if i did take the kingdom from your sons
 to make amends ill give it to your daughter
 if i have kill'd the issue of your womb
 to quicken your increase i will beget
 mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
 a grandam's name is little less in love
 than is the doting title of a mother
 they are as children but one step below
 even of your mettle of your very blood
 of an one pain save for a night of groans
 endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow
 your children were vexation to your youth
 but mine shall be a comfort to your age
 the loss you have is but a son being king
 and by that loss your daughter is made queen
 i cannot make you what amends i would
 therefore accept such kindness as i can
 dorset your son that with a fearful soul
 leads discontented steps in foreign soil
 this fair alliance quickly shall call home
 to high promotions and great dignity
 the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
 familiarly shall call thy dorset brother
 again shall you be mother to a king
 and all the ruins of distressful times
 repair'd with double riches of content
 what we have many goodly days to see
 the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
 shall come again transform'd to orient pearl
 advantaging their loan with interest
 of ten times double gain of happiness
 go then my mother to thy daughter go
 make bold her bashful years with your experience
 prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
 put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
 of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
 with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
 and when this arm of mine hath chastised
 the petty rebel dullbrain'd buckingham
 bound with triumphant garlands will i come
 and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed
 to whom i will retail my conquest won
 and she shall be sole victress caesar's caesar
queen elizabeth what were i best to say her father's brother
 would be her lord or shall i say her uncle
 or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
 under what title shall i woo for thee
 that god the law my honour and her love
 can make seem pleasing to her tender years
king richard iii infer fair england's peace by this alliance
queen elizabeth which she shall purchase with still lasting war
king richard iii say that the king which may command entreats
queen elizabeth that at her hands which the king's king forbids
king richard iii say she shall be a high and mighty queen
queen elizabeth to wail the tide as her mother doth
king richard iii say i will love her everlastingly
queen elizabeth but how long shall that title ever last
king richard iii sweetly in force unto her fair life's end
queen elizabeth but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last
king richard iii so long as heaven and nature lengthens it
queen elizabeth so long as hell and richard likes of it
king richard iii say i her sovereign am her subject love
queen elizabeth but she your subject loathes such sovereignty
king richard iii be eloquent in my behalf to her
queen elizabeth an honest tale speeds best being plainly told
king richard iii then in plain terms tell her my loving tale
queen elizabeth plain and not honest is too harsh a style
king richard iii your reasons are too shallow and too quick
queen elizabeth o no my reasons are too deep and dead
 too deep and dead poor infants in their grave
king richard iii harp not on that string madam that is past
queen elizabeth harp on it still shall i till heartstrings break
king richard iii now by my george my garter and my crown
queen elizabeth profaned dishonour'd and the third usurp'd
king richard iii i swear
queen elizabeth by nothing for this is no oath
 the george profaned hath lost his holy honour
 the garter blemish'd pawn'd his knightly virtue
 the crown usurp'd disgraced his kingly glory
 if something thou wilt swear to be believed
 swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd
king richard iii now by the world
queen elizabeth tis full of thy foul wrongs
king richard iii my father's death
queen elizabeth thy life hath that dishonour'd
king richard iii then by myself
queen elizabeth thyself thyself misusest
king richard iii why then by god
queen elizabeth god's wrong is most of all
 if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
 the unity the king thy brother made
 had not been broken nor my brother slain
 if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
 the imperial metal circling now thy brow
 had graced the tender temples of my child
 and both the princes had been breathing here
 which now two tender playfellows to dust
 thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
 what canst thou swear by now
king richard iii the time to come
queen elizabeth that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast
 for i myself have many tears to wash
 hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee
 the children live whose parents thou hast
 slaughter'd
 ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age
 the parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd
 old wither'd plants to wail it with their age
 swear not by time to come for that thou hast
 misused ere used by time misused o'erpast
king richard iii as i intend to prosper and repent
 so thrive i in my dangerous attempt
 of hostile arms myself myself confound
 heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
 day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
 be opposite all planets of good luck
 to my proceedings if with pure heart's love
 immaculate devotion holy thoughts
 i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
 in her consists my happiness and thine
 without her follows to this land and me
 to thee herself and many a christian soul
 death desolation ruin and decay
 it cannot be avoided but by this
 it will not be avoided but by this
 therefore good motheri must can you so
 be the attorney of my love to her
 plead what i will be not what i have been
 not my deserts but what i will deserve
 urge the necessity and state of times
 and be not peevishfond in great designs
queen elizabeth shall i be tempted of the devil thus
king richard iii ay if the devil tempt thee to do good
queen elizabeth shall i forget myself to be myself
king richard iii ay if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself
queen elizabeth but thou didst kill my children
king richard iii but in your daughter's womb i bury them
 where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
 selves of themselves to your recomforture
queen elizabeth shall i go win my daughter to thy will
king richard iii and be a happy mother by the deed
queen elizabeth i go write to me very shortly
 and you shall understand from me her mind
king richard iii bear her my true love's kiss and so farewell

 throng to the bar crying all guilty guilty
 i shall despair there is no creature loves me
 and if i die no soul shall pity me

 that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here
lords how have you slept my lord
richmond the sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams
 that ever enter'd in a drowsy head
 have i since your departure had my lords
 methought their souls whose bodies richard murder'd
 came to my tent and cried on victory
 i promise you my soul is very jocund
 in the remembrance of so fair a dream
 how far into the morning is it lords
lords upon the stroke of four
richmond why then tis time to arm and give direction
 his oration to his soldiers
 more than i have said loving countrymen
 the leisure and enforcement of the time
 forbids to dwell upon yet remember this
 god and our good cause fight upon our side
 the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
 like highrear'd bulwarks stand before our faces
 richard except those whom we fight against
 had rather have us win than him they follow
 for what is he they follow truly gentlemen
 a bloody tyrant and a homicide
 one raised in blood and one in blood establish'd
 one that made means to come by what he hath
 and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him
 abase foul stone made precious by the foil
 of england's chair where he is falsely set
 one that hath ever been god's enemy
 then if you fight against god's enemy
 god will in justice ward you as his soldiers
 if you do sweat to put a tyrant down
 you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
 if you do fight against your country's foes
 your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire
 if you do fight in safeguard of your wives
 your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
 if you do free your children from the sword
 your children's children quit it in your age
 then in the name of god and all these rights
 advance your standards draw your willing swords
 for me the ransom of my bold attempt
 shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face
 but if i thrive the gain of my attempt
 the least of you shall share his part thereof
 sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully

 go gentleman every man unto his charge
 let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
 conscience is but a word that cowards use
 devised at first to keep the strong in awe
 our strong arms be our conscience swords our law
 march on join bravely let us to't pellmell
 if not to heaven then hand in hand to hell
 his oration to his army
 what shall i say more than i have inferr'd
 remember whom you are to cope withal
 a sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways
 a scum of bretons and base lackey peasants
 whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth
 to desperate ventures and assured destruction
 you sleeping safe they bring to you unrest
 you having lands and blest with beauteous wives
 they would restrain the one distain the other
 and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
 long kept in bretagne at our mother's cost
 a milksop one that never in his life
 felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
 let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again
 lash hence these overweening rags of france
 these famish'd beggars weary of their lives
 who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
 for want of means poor rats had hang'd themselves
 if we be conquer'd let men conquer us
 and not these bastard bretons whom our fathers
 have in their own land beaten bobb'd and thump'd
 and in record left them the heirs of shame
 shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives
 ravish our daughters
 drum afar off
 hark i hear their drum
 fight gentlemen of england fight bold yoemen
 draw archers draw your arrows to the head
 spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood
 amaze the welkin with your broken staves
 enter a messenger
 what says lord stanley will he bring his power
messenger my lord he doth deny to come
king richard iii off with his son george's head
norfolk my lord the enemy is past the marsh
 after the battle let george stanley die
king richard iii a thousand hearts are great within my bosom
 advance our standards set upon our foes
 our ancient word of courage fair saint george
 inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
 upon them victory sits on our helms
 exeunt

scene iv another part of the field
 alarum excursions enter norfolk and forces
 fighting to him catesby
catesby rescue my lord of norfolk rescue rescue
 the king enacts more wonders than a man
 daring an opposite to every danger
 his horse is slain and all on foot he fights
 seeking for richmond in the throat of death
 rescue fair lord or else the day is lost
 alarums enter king richard iii
king richard iii a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
catesby withdraw my lord i'll help you to a horse
king richard iii slave i have set my life upon a cast
 and i will stand the hazard of the die
 i think there be six richmonds in the field
 five have i slain today instead of him
 a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
 exeunt

scene v another part of the field
 alarum enter king richard iii and richmond they
 fight king richard iii is slain retreat and
 flourish reenter richmond derby bearing the
 crown with divers other lords
richmond god and your arms be praised victorious friends
 the day is ours the bloody dog is dead
derby courageous richmond well hast thou acquit thee
 lo here this longusurped royalty
 from the dead temples of this bloody wretch
 have i pluck'd off to grace thy brows withal
 wear it enjoy it and make much of it
richmond great god of heaven say amen to all
 but tell me is young george stanley living
derby he is my lord and safe in leicester town
 whither if it please you we may now withdraw us
richmond what men of name are slain on either side
derby john duke of norfolk walter lord ferrers
 sir robert brakenbury and sir william brandon
richmond inter their bodies as becomes their births
 proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
 that in submission will return to us
 and then as we have ta'en the sacrament
 we will unite the white rose and the red
 smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
 that long have frown'd upon their enmity
 what traitor hears me and says not amen
 england hath long been mad and scarr'd herself
 the brother blindly shed the brother's blood
 the father rashly slaughter'd his own son
 the son compell'd been butcher to the sire
 all this divided york and lancaster
 divided in their dire division
 o now let richmond and elizabeth
 the true succeeders of each royal house
 by god's fair ordinance conjoin together
 and let their heirs god if thy will be so
 enrich the time to come with smoothfaced peace
 with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
 abate the edge of traitors gracious lord
 that would reduce these bloody days again
 and make poor england weep in streams of blood
 let them not live to taste this land's increase
 that would with treason wound this fair land's peace
 now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again
 that she may long live here god say amen
 exeunt
